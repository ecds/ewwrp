up on each side of the round table, that had a cheerful spread on't,

lay stretched out in luxurious ease on his cushion, a-watchin' with
dignified indulgence the gambollin' of our little pup dog. He is
young yet, and Dick looked lenient on the innocent caperin's of
youth.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13019">Dick is very wise.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13021">The firelight sparkled on the clean hearth, the lamplight gleamed
down onto my needles as I sot peaceful a-seamin' two and two, and the

pardner dropped his paper, and sez he—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13023">"Samantha, why not write a book on't?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13024">It started me, comin' so onexpected onto me, and specially sence
he wuz always so sot aginst my swingin' out in Literatoor.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13025">I dropped two or three stitches in my inward agitation, but

We should slight Columbus and turn Our backs onto America inthis
crisis of her history? It would be simply ruinous to Our reputation

the President down. More'n as likely as not I should never hold
another office in Jonesville. Cheese would be sold right over my head
by I know not who. I should be ordered out to work on the road like a
dog by Ury jest as like as not. I've been a-settin' here and turnin'
it over in my mind; and though, as you say, I hain't always favored
the idee of writin', still at the present time I believe We'd better
write the book. There's ink in the house, hain't there?" sez he

what is in front of it, a-bagonin' it onwards?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13042">"No," sez he calmly; "I look at it with the eye of a business man,
and with that eye," sez he, "I say less write the book."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13043">He ceased his remarks, and agin silence rained in the room.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13045"> But to me the silence wuz filled with the voices that he couldn't

viewless hosts passed before me and gin me the silent countersign to

into the future, the Shadow Host defiled—fur off, fur

<lb/>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="mhworld_13051">CHRISTOPHER COLUMBUS has always been a object of extreme interest and admiration to me ever sence I first read about him in my old Olney 's Gography, up to the time when I hearn he wuz a-goin' to be celebrated in Chicago.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13052">I always looked up to Christopher, I always admired him, and in a modest and meetin'-house sense, I will say boldly and with no fear of Josiah before my eyes that I loved him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13053">Havin' such feelin's for Christopher Columbus, as I had, and Navin' such feelin's for New Discoverers, do you spoze I wuz a-goin' to have a celebration gin for him, and also for us as bein' discovered by him, without attendin' to it?</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13055">No, indeed! I made calculations ahead from <pb xml:id="mhworld_13054" n="2 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>the very first minute it wuz spoke on, to attend to it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13056">And feelin' as I did—all wrought up on the subject of Christopher Columbus—it wuz a coincerdence singular enough to skair anybody almost to death—to think that right on the very day Christopher discovered America, and us (only 400 years later), and on the very day that I commenced the fine shirt that Josiah wuz a-goin' to wear to Chicago to celebrate him in—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13057">That very Friday, if you'll believe me, Christopher Columbus walked right into our kitchen at Jonesville—and discovered me.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13058">Yes, Christopher Columbus Allen, a relative I never had seen, come to Jonesville and our house on his way to the World's Fair.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13059">Jest to think on't—Christopher Columbus Allen, who had passed his hull life up in Maine, and then descended down onto us at such a time as this, when all the relations in Jonesville wuz jest riz up about the doin's of that great namesake of hisen—And the gussets wuz even then a-bein' cut out and sewed on to the shirt that wuz a-goin' to encompass Josiah Allen about as he went to Chicago to celebrate him—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13063">That then, on that Friday, P.M., about the time of

day that the Injuns wuz a-kneelin' to the first Christopher, to think that Josiah Allen should walk in the new Columbus into our kitchen—why, I don't spoze a more singular and coincidin' circumstance ever happened before durin' the hull course of time.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13064">The only incident that mellered it down any and made it a little less miracalous wuz the fact that he never had been called by his full name.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13065">He always has been, is now, and I spoze always will be called Krit—Krit Allen.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13066">But still it wuz—in spite of this mellerin' and amelioratin' circumstance—strikin' and skairful enough to fill me with or.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13067">He wuz a double and twisted relation, as you may say, bein' related to us on both our own sides, Josiah's and mine.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13068">But I had never sot eyes on him till that day, though I well remember visitin' his parents, who lived then in the outskirts of Loontown—good respectable Methodist Epospical people—and runners of a cheese factory at that time.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13069">Tryphenia Smith, relation on my side, married to Ezra Allen, relation on Josiah's side.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13071">I remember that I went there on a visit with my mother at a very early period of my existence. I hadn't existed at that time more'n nine years, if I <pb xml:id="mhworld_13070" n="5 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>had that. We staid there on a stiddy stretch for a week; that wuz jest before they moved up to Maine.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13072">Uncle Ezra had a splendid chance offered him there, and he fell in with it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13073">She wuz a dretful good creeter, Aunt Tryphenia wuz, and greatly beloved by the relations on his side, as well as hern.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13074">Though, as is nateral with relations, she had to be run by 'em more or less, and found fault with. Some thought her nose wuz too long. Some on 'em thought she wuz too religious, and some on 'em thought she wuzn't religious enough. Some on 'em thought she wuzn't sot enough on the creeds, and some thought she wuz too rigid.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13075">But, howsumever, pretty nigh all the Allens and Smiths jest doted on her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13076">There wuz one incident that jest impressed itself on my memory in connection with that visit, and I don't spoze I shall ever forgit it; it stands to reason that I should before now, if I ever wuz a-goin' to.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13077">It took place at family prayers, which they held regular at Uncle Ezra's.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13078">It wuz right in the hite of sugarin'. They had more'n two hundred maple trees, and they had tapped 'em all, and they had run free, and they had to sugar off every day, and sometimes twice a day.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_13079" n="6 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_13080">That mornin' they had a big kettle of maple syrup over the stove, and Uncle Ezra and Aunt Tryphenia and mother wuz all a-kneelin' down pretty nigh to the stove. It wuz a cold mornin', and I wuz a-settin' with my little legs a-hangin' off the chair a-watchin' things, not at that age bein' particular interested in religion.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13081">Uncle Ezra made a long prayer, a tegus one, it seemed to me; it wuz so long that the kettle of sugar had het up fearful, and I see with deep anxiety that it wuz a-mountin' up most to the top of the kettle.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13082">Of course I dassent move to open the stove door, or stir it down, or anything—no, I dassent make a move of any kind or a mite of noise in prayer time. So I sot demute, but in deep anxiety, a-watchin' it sizzle up higher and higher and then down agin, as is the way of syrup, but each time a sizzlin' up a little higher.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13083">Wall, finally Uncle Ezra got through with his prayer, and dear good Aunt Tryphenia begun hern. She spoke dretful kinder moderate, but religious and good as anything could be.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13084">I well remember what it wuz she wuz sayin'—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13086">"O Lord, let us be tried as by fire and not be moved"—I remember she said movéd instead of <pb xml:id="mhworld_13085" n="7 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>moved, which wuz impressive to me, never havin' hearn it pronounced that way before.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13087">And jest as she said this over went the sugar onto the stove, and Aunt Tryphenia and Uncle Ezra jest jumped right up and went and lifted the kettle offen the stove.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13088">I remember well how kinder bewildered and curious mother looked when she opened her eyes and see that the prayer wuz broke right short off. Aunt Tryphenia looked meachin', and Uncle Ezra put his hat right on and went out to the barn.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13089">It wuz dretful embarrissin' to him and Aunt Tryphenia. But then I don't know as they could have helped it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13090">I remember hearin' Father and Mother arguin' about it. Father thought she done right, but Mother wuz kinder of the opinion that she ort to have run the prayer right on and let the sugar spile if necessary.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13091">But I remember Father's arguin' that he didn't believe her prayer would have been very lucid or fervent, with all that batch of sugar a-sizzlin' and a-burnin' right by the side of her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13093">I remember that he said that a prayer wouldn't be apt to ascend much higher than where one's hopes and thoughts wuz, and he didn't believe it would go <pb xml:id="mhworld_13092" n="8 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>up much higher than that kettle. (The stove wuz the common height, not over four feet.)</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13094">But Mother held to her own opinion, and so did a good many of the relations, mostly females. It wuz talked over quite a good deal amongst the Smiths. The wimmen all blamed Tryphenia more or less. The men mostly approved of savin' the sugar.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13095">But good land! how I am eppisodin', and to resoom and go on.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13096">As I say, it wuz jest after this that Uncle Ezra's folks moved up to Maine, Christopher Columbus bein' still onborn for years and years.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13097">But bein' born in due time, or ruther as I may say out of due time, for Uncle Ezra and Aunt Tryphenia had been married over twenty years before they had a child, and then they branched out and had two, and then stopped—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_13098">But bein' born at last and growin' up to be a good-lookin' young man and well-to-do in the world, he come out to Jonesville on business and also to foller up the ties of relationship that wuz stretched out acrost hill and dale clear from Maine to Jonesville.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130100">Strange ties, hain't they? that are so little that they are invisible to the naked eye, or spectacles, or <pb xml:id="mhworld_13099" n="9 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>the keenest microscope, and yet are so strong and lastin' that the strongest sledge-hammer can't break 'em or even make a dent into 'em.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130101">And old Time himself, that crumbles stun work and mountains, cant seem to make any impression on 'em. Curious, hain't it?</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130102">But to leave moralizin' and to resoom, it was on Friday, P. M., that he arrove at our home.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130103">I see a good-lookin' young chap a-comin' up the path from the front gate with my Josiah, and I hastily but firmly turned my apron the other side out—I had been windin' some blue yarn that day for some socks for my Josiah, and had colored it a little—it wuz a white apron—and then I waited middlin' serene till he come in with him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130104">And lo! and behold! Josiah introduced him as Christopher Columbus Allen, my own cousin on my own side, and also on hisen.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130105">He wuz a very good-lookin' chap, some older than Thomas Jefferson, and I do declare if he didn't look some like him, which wouldn't be nothin' aginst the law, or aginst reason, bein' that they wuz related to each other.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130107">I wuz glad enough to see him, and I inquired after the relations with considerable interest, and some affection (not such an awful sight, never <pb xml:id="mhworld_130106" n="10 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>havin' seen 'em much, but a little, jest about enough).</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130108">And then I learnt with some sadness that his father and mother had passed away not long before that, and that his sister Isabelle wuz not over well.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130109">And there wuz another coincerdence that struck aginst me almost hard enough to knock me down.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130110">Isabelle! jest think on't, when my mind wuz on a perfect strain about Isabelle Casteel.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130111">Columbus and Isabelle!—the idee!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130112">Why, my reason almost tottered on its throne under my recent best head-dress, when I hearn him speak the name. Christopher Columbus a tellin' me about Isabelle—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130113">I declare I wuz that wrought up that I expected every minute to hear him tell me somethin' about Ferdinand; but I do believe that I should have broke down under that.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130114">But it wuz all explained out to me afterwards by another relation that come onto us onexpected shortly afterwards.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130115">It seemed that Uncle Ezra and Aunt Tryphenia, after they went to Maine, moved into a sort of a new place, where it wuz dretful lonesome.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130119">They lost every book they had, owin' to a axident

on their journey, and the only book their nighest neighbor had wuz the life of Queen Isabelle.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130120">And so Aunt Tryphenia for years wuz, as you may say, jest saturated with that book. And she named her two children, born durin' that time of saturation, Christopher Columbus and Isabelle. And I presoom if she had had another, she would have named it King Ferdinand. Though I hain't sure of this—you can't be postive certain of any such thing as this. Besides it might have been born a girl onbeknown to her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130121">But I know that she never washed them children with anything but Casteel soap, and she talked sights and sights about Spain and things.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130122">So I hearn from Uncle Jered Smith, who visited them while he wuz up on a tower through Maine, a-sellin' balsam of pine for the lungs.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130123">Wall, Isabelle had a sort of a runnin' down, so Krit said. He begged us to call him that—said that all his mates at school called him so. He had been educated quite high. Had been to deestrick school sights, and then to a 'Cademy and College. He had kinder worked his way up, so I found out, and so had Isabelle.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130125">She had graduated from a Young Woman's College, taught school to earn her money, and then <pb xml:id="mhworld_130124" n="13 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>went to school as long as that would last, and then would set out and teach agin, and then go agin and then taught, and then went.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130126">She wuz younger than Christopher, but he owned up to me that it wuz her example that had rousted him up to exert himself.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130127">She wuz awful ambitious, Isabelle wuz. She wuz smart as she could be, and had a feelin' that she wanted to be sunthin' in the World.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130128">But then the old folks wuz took down sick and helpless, and one of the children had to stay to home. And Isabelle staid, and sent Krit out into the World.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130129">She sold her jewels of Ambition and Happiness, and gin him the avails of them.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130130">She staid to home with the old folks—kinder peevish and fretful, Krit said they wuz, too—and let him go a-sailin' out on the broad ocean of life; she had trimmed her own sails in such hope, but had to curb 'em in now and lower the topmast.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130132">You have to reef your sails considerable when you are a-sailin' round in a small bedroom between two beds of sickness (asthma and inflammatory rheumatiz). You have to haul 'em in, and take down the flyin' pennen of Hope and Asperation, and mount up the lamp of Duty and Meekness for a <pb n="14" pages="14" facs="mhworld014"/>figger-head, instead of the glowin' face of Proud Endeavor.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130133">But them lamps give a dretful meller, soft light, when they are well mounted up, and firm sot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130134">The light on 'em hain't to be compared to any other light on sea or on shore. It wrops 'em round so serene and glowin' that walks in it. It rests on their mild forwards in a sort of a halo that shines off on the hard things of this life and makes 'em endurable, takes the edge kinder off of the hardest, keenest sufferin's, and goes before 'em throwin' a light over the deep waters that must be passed, and sort o' melts in and loses itself in the ineffible radiance that streams out from acrost the other side.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130135">It is a curious light and a beautiful one. And Isabelle jest journeyed in its full radiance.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130136">Wall, Isabelle would do what she sot out to do, you could see that by her face. Krit had brought her photograph with him—he thought his eyes of her—and I liked her looks first rate.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130137" n="15 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130138">It wuz a beautiful face, with more than beauty in it too. It wuz inteligent and serene, with the serenity of the sweet soul within. And it had a look deep down in the eyes, a sort of a shadow that is got by passin' through the Valley of Sorrow.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130139">I hears afterwards what that look meant.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130140">Isabelle had been engaged to a smart, well-meanin' chap, Tom Freeman by name, not over and above rich, and one that had his own duties to attend to. Two helpless aged ones, and two little nieces to took care on, and nobody but himself to earn the money to do it with.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130141">The little nieces' Pa had gone to California after his wife's death—and hadn't been hearn from sence. The little children had been left with their grandparents and Uncle Tom to stay till their Pa got back. And as he didn't git back, of course they kept on a-stayin', and had to be took care on. They wuz bright little creeters, and the very apples of their eyes. But they cost money, and they cost love, and Tom had to give it, for they lost what little property they had about this time—and the feeble Grandma couldn't do much, and the Grandpa died not long after the eppisode I am about to relate.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130143">So it all devolved onto Tom. And Tom riz up <pb xml:id="mhworld_130142" n="16 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>to his duties nobly, though it wuz with a sad heart, as wuz spozed, for Isabelle, when she see what had come onto him to do, wouldn't hold him to his engagement—she insisted on his bein' free.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130144">I spoze she thought she wouldn't burden him with two more helpless ones, and then mebby she thought the two spans wouldn't mate very well. And most probable they would have been a pretty cross match. (I mean, that is, a sort of a melancholy, down-sperited yoke, and if anybody laughs at it, I would wish 'em to laugh in a sort of a mournful way.)</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130145">Wall, Tom Freeman, after Isabelle sot him free, bein' partly mad and partly heartbroken, as is the way of men who are deep in love, and want their way, but anyway wantin' to keep out of the sight of the one who, if he couldn't have her for his own, he wanted to forgit—he packed up bag and baggage and went West.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130146">Isabelle wouldn't correspond with him, so she told him in that last hour—still and calm on the outside, and her heart a-bleedin' on the inside, I dare presoom to say; no, she wanted him to feel free.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130148">What creeters, what creeters wimmen be for makin' martyrs of themselves, and burnt sacrifices—<pb xml:id="mhworld_130147" n="17 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>sometimes I most think they enjoy it, and then agin I don't know!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130149">But Isabelle acted from a sense of duty, for she jest worshipped the ground Tom Freeman Walked on, so everybody knew, and so she bid adieu to Tom and Happiness, and lived on.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130150">Wall, one of 'em must stay at home with the old folks, either she or Christopher Columbus. And when a man and a woman love each other as Isabelle and Krit did, when wuz it ever the case but what if there wuz any sacrificin' to do the woman wuz the one to do it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130151">It is her nater, and I don't know but a real true woman takes as much comfort in bein' sort o' onhappy for the sake of some one she loves, as she would in swingin' right out and a-enjoyin' herself first rate.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130152">A woman who really loves anything has the makin' of a first-class martyr in her. And though she may not be ever tied to a stake, and gridirons be fur removed from her, still she has a sort of a silent hankerin' or aptitude for martrydom. That is, she would fur ruther be onhappy herself than to have the beloved object wretched. And if either of 'em has got to face trouble and privation, why she is the one that stands ready to face 'em.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130153" n="18 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130154">So Isabelle sent Krit off into the great world to conquer it if possible.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130155">And Krit, as the nater of man is, felt that he would ruther branch and work his way along through the World, and work hard and venter and dare and try to conquer fortune, than to set round and endure and suffer and be calm.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130156">Men are not, although they are likely creeters and I wish 'em well, yet truth compels me to say that they are not very much gin to follerin' this text, "To suffer and be calm."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130157">No, they had ruther rampage round and kill the lions in the way than to camp down in front of 'em and try to subdue 'em with kindness and long 
sufferin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130158">Krit, as the nateral nater of man is, felt that he could and would earn a good place in the World, win it with hard work, and then lift Isabelle up onto the high platform by the side of him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130159">Though whether he had made any plans as how he wuz a-goin' to hist up the two feeble old invalids, that I can't state, not knowin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130161">But Isabelle, he did lay out to do well by her, thinkin' as he did such a amazin' lot of her, and knowin' how she gin up her own ambitious hopes for his sake, and knowin' well, though he didn't <pb xml:id="mhworld_130160" n="19 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>really feel free to interfere, how she had signed the death-warrant to her own happiness when she parted with Tom Freeman. But so it wuz.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130162">Wall, Krit wouldn't have to lift up the old folks onto any worldly hite, for the Lord took 'em up into His own habitation, higher I spoze than any earthly mount. About six months before Krit come to Jonesville, they both passed away most at the same time, and wuz buried in one grave.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130163">Wall, we all on us in Jonesville thought a sight of Krit before he had been with us a week. He had come partly to see a man in Jonesville on particular business, and partly to see us. He wuz a civil engineer, jest as civil and polite a one as I ever laid eyes on, and wuz a-doin' well, but Thomas Jefferson thought he could help him to a still better place and position.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130164">Thomas J. is very popular in Jonesville. He is doin' a big business all over the county, and is very influential.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130165">Wall, Krit's business bid fair to keep him for some time in Jonesville and the vicinity, and as he see that Josiah Allen and I wuz a-makin' preparations to go to the World's Fair—and bein' warmly pursuaded by us to that effect, he concluded to stay and accompany us thither. The idee wuz very agreeable to us.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130166" n="20 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130167">He said his sister Isabelle, after she wuz a little recooperated from her grief for the old folks, and recovered a little from the sickness that she had after they left her, she too laid out to come on to Chicago, and spend a few weeks.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130168">He wuz a-layin' out to reconoiter round and find a good place for her to board and take good care on her.

"There hain't any wickedness a-goin' on to the Fair as I know of; it is a goin' to be full and overflowin' of object lessons a teachin' of the greatness and the glory of the Lord of Heaven, and the might and power of the human intellect.

"On week days it is a exaltin' and upliftin' and dreadful religious sight; but on Sundays it is a crime to even think on it.

I feel that it is my duty to lift my voice and my strength aginst the Sunday openin' of the Fair, and even if the boys did go to worse places, my conscience would be clear; the sin wouldn't rest on my head."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130860">Sez Arville, "That is the very way I have heard wimmen talk who burned up their boys' cards, and checker-boards, and story-books, and drove their children away from home to find amusement.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130862">"They wanted the boys to set down and read the Bible and sam books year in and year out, but they wouldn't do it, for there wuz times when the young <pb xml:id="mhworld_130861" n="125 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>blood in 'em riz up and clamered for recreation and amusement, and seein' that they couldn't git it at home, under the fosterin' care of their father and mother, why, they looked for it elsewhere, and found it in low saloons and bar-rooms, amongst wicked and depraved companions. And then, when their boys turned out gamblers and drunkards, they would say that their consciences wuz clear.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130863">"But," says Arville, "that hain't the way the Lord done.

And if I had ten boys—"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130864">"Which you hain't no ways likely to have," says Miss Cork; "no, indeed, you hain't."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130865">"No, thank Heaven! there hain't no chance on't. But if I had ten boys I would ruther have 'em wanderin' through them beautiful halls, full of the wonders of the world which the Lord made and give to His children for their amusement and comfort—I would ruther have 'em there than to have 'em help swell a congregation of country loafers in a city saloon—learnin' in one day more lessons in the height and depth of depravity than years of country livin' would teach 'em.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130866" n="126 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130867">"These places, and worse ones, legalized places of devils' pastime, will lure and beckon the raw youth of the country. They will flaunt their gaudy attractions on every side, and appeal to every sense but the sense of decency.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130868">"And I would feel fur safer about the hull ten of 'em, if I knew they wuz safe in the art galleries, full of beauty and sublimity, drawin' their minds and hearts insensibly and in spite of themselves upward and onward, or lookin' at the glory and wonders of practical and mechanical beauty—the beauty of use and invention.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130869">"After walkin' through a buildin' forty-five acres big, and some more of 'em about as roomy, I should be pretty sure that they wouldn't git out of it in time to go any great lengths in sin that day; and they would be apt to be too fagged out and dead tired to foller on after Satan any great distance."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130870">"Well," says Miss Snyder, "I d'no but I should feel safer about my Jim and John to have 'em there in the Fair buildin's than runnin' loose in the streets of Chicago. They won't go to meetin' every Sunday, and I can't make 'em; and if they do go, they will go in the mornin' late, and git out as soon as the Amen is said.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130872">"My boys are as good as the average—full as <pb xml:id="mhworld_130871" n="127 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>good; but I know when they hain't got anything to do, and git with other boys, they will cut up and act."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130873">"Well," says Miss Cornelius Cork, "I know that my Cornelius will never disgrace himself or me by any low acts."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130874">She wuz tellin' a big story, for Cornelius Jr. had been carried home more'n once too drunk to walk, besides other mean acts that wuz worse; so we didn't say anything, but we all looked queer; and Arville kinder sniffed, and turned up her nose, and nudged Miss Snyder. But Miss Cork kep right on—she is real high-headed and conceited, Miss Cork is.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130875">And, sez she, "Much as I want to see the Fair, and much as I want Cornelius and Cornelius Jr. to go to it, and the rest of the country, I would ruther not have it take place at all than to have it open Sundays."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130876">"And I feel jest so," sez Miss Henzy.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130877">Then young Lihu Widrig spoke up. He is old Elihu Widrig's only son, and he has been off to college, and is home on a vacation.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130878">He is dretful deep learnt, has studied Greek and lots of other languages that are dead, and some that are most dead.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130879">He spoke up, and sez he:</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130880">"What is this Sabbath, anyway?"</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130881" n="128 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130882">We didn't any of us like that, and we showed we didn't by our means.

Before old Babylon ever riz up at all, to say nothin' of fallin', the dwellers in the Euphrates Valley kep a Sabbath. They spozed there wuz seven planets, and one day wuz give to each of them. And Saturday, the old Jewish Sabbath, wuz given to Saturn, cruel as ever he could be if the ur in his name wuz changed to e. In those days it wuz not forbidden to work in that day, but supposed to be unlucky.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130885">"Some as Ma regards Friday."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130886">It wuz known that Miss Widrig wouldn't begin a mite of work Fridays, not even hemin' a towel or settin' up a sock or mitten.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130887">And, sez he, "When we come down through history to the Hebrews, we find it a part of the Mosaic law, the Ten Commandments.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130889">"In the second book of the Bible we find the reason given for keeping the Sabbath is, the Lord rested on that day. In the fifth book we find the <pb xml:id="mhworld_130888" n="129 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>reason given is the keeping of a memorial for the deliverance out of Egypt.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130890">"Now this commandment only forbids working on that day; no matter what else you do, you are obeying the fourth commandment. According to that command, you could go to the World's Fair, or wherever you had a mind to, if you did not work.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130891">"The Puritan Sabbath wuz a very different one from that observed by Moses and the Prophets, which wuz mainly a day of rest."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130892">"Wall, I know," sez Miss Yerden, "that the only right way to keep the Sabbath is jest as we do, go to meetin' and Sunday-school, and do jest as we do."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130893">Sez Lihu, "Maybe the people to whom the law wuz delivered didn't understand its meaning so well as we do to-day, after the lapse of so many centuries, so well as you do, Miss Yerden."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130894">We all looked coldly at Lihu; we didn't approve of his talk. But Miss Yerden looked tickled, she is so blind in her own conceit, and Lihu spoke so polite to her, she thought he considered her word as goin' beyond the Bible.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130895">Then Lophemia Pegrum spoke up, and sez she—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130896">"Don't you believe in keeping the Sabbath, Lihu?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130897">"Yes, indeed, I do," sez he, firm and decided.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130898" n="130 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130899">"I do believe in it with all my heart.

It wuz like havin' somebody take a spade and dig up the voyalets and lilies on the grave of the nearest and dearest, to try to prove sunthin' or ruther.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130907">We feel in such circumstances that we had ruther be mistook than to have them sweet posies disturbed and desecrated.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130908">Holy words of counsel, and reproof, and consolation delivered from the Most High to His saints and prophets—words that are whispered over our cradles, and whose truth enters our lives with our mother's milk; that sustains us and helps us to bear the hard toils and burdens of the day of life, and that go with us through the Valley and the Shadow—the only revelation we have of God's will to man, the written testimony of His love and compassion, and the only map in which we trace our titles clear to a heavenly inheritance.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130909">If errors and mistakes have crept in through the weaknesses of men, or if the pages have become blotted by the dust of time, we hated to have 'em brung out and looked too clost into—we hated to, like a dog.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130910" n="132 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130911">So we, most all of us, had a fellow feelin' for Miss Yerden, and looked approvin' at her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130912">And Lihu, seein' we looked cold at him, and bein' sensitive, and havin' a hard cold, he said "he guessed he would go over to the drug-store and git some hoarhoun candy for his cough."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130913">So he went out. And then Miss Cork spoke up, and sez she—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130914">"How it would look in the eyes of the other nations to have us a breakin' Sundays after keepin' 'em pure and holy for all these years."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130915">"Pure and holy?" sez Arvilly. "Why, jest look right here in the country, and see the way the Sabbath is desecrated. Saturday nights and Sundays is the very time for the devil's high jinks. More whiskey and beer and hard cider is consumed Saturday nights and Sundays than durin' all the rest of the week.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130916">"Why, right in my neighborhood a man who makes cider brandy carrys off hull barrels of it most every Saturday, so's to have it ready for Sunday consumption.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130917">"The saloons are crowded that day, and black eyes, and bruised bodies, and sodden intellects, and achin' hearts are more frequent Sundays than any other day of the week, and you know it.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130918" n="133 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130919">"And after standin' all this desecration calmly for year after year, and votin' to uphold it, it don't look consistent to flare up and be so dretful afraid of desecratin' the Sabbath by havin' a place of education, greater than the world has ever seen or ever will see agin, open on the Sabbath for the youth of the land."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130920">"But the nation," sez Miss Henzy, in a skareful voice. "This nation must keep up its glorious reputation before the other countries of the world. How will it look to 'em to have our Goverment permit such Sunday desecration? This is a national affair, and we should not be willin' to have our glorious nation do anything to lower itself in the eyes of the assembled and envious world."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130921">Sez Arville, "If our nation can countenance such doin's as I have spoke of, the man-killin' and brute-makin', all day Sundays, and not only permit it, but go into pardnership with it, and take part of the pay—if it can do this Sundays, year after year, without bein' ashamed before the other nations, I guess it will stand it to have the Fair open."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130923">"But," says Miss Bobbet, "even if it is better for the youth of the country, and I d'no but it <pb xml:id="mhworld_130922" n="134 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>will be, it will have a bad look to the other nations, as Sister Henzy sez—it will look bad."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130924">Says Arville, "That is what Miss Balcomb said about her Ned when she wouldn't let him play games to home; she said she didn't care so much about it herself, but thought the neighbors would blame her; and Ned got to goin' away from home for amusement, and is now a low gambler and loafer. I wonder whether she would ruther have kep her boy safe, or made the neighbors easy in their minds.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130925">"And now the neighbors talk as bad agin when they see him a-reelin' by.

I have seen worse thunder-storms Sundays, it does seem to me, than I ever see week days. And when old Mom Nater sets such a show a-goin' Sundays, you have got to tend it, whether you think it is wicked or not.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130936">"And as for the work of carryin' folks back and forth to it, meetin'-housen have to run by work—hard work, too. Preachin', and singin', and ringin' bells, and openin' doors, and lightin' gas, and usherin' folks in, and etc., etc., etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130937">"And horse-cars and steam-cars have to run to and frow; conductors, and brakemen, and firemen, and engineers, and etc., etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130938">"And horses have to be harnessed and worked hard, and coachmen, and drivers, and men and wimmen have to work hard Sundays. Yes, indeed.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130940">"Now, my sister-in-law, Jane Lanfear, works harder Sundays than any day out of the seven. <pb xml:id="mhworld_130939" n="137 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>They take a place with thirty cows on it, and she and Jim, bein' ambitious, do almost all the work themselves.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130941">"Every Sunday mornin' Jane gets up, and she and Jim goes out and milks fifteen cows apiece, and then Jim drives them off to pasture and comes back and harnesses up and carries the milk three miles to a cheese factory, and comes back and does the other out-door chores.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130942">"And Jane gets breakfast, and gets up the three little children, and washes 'em and dresses 'em, and feeds the little ones to the table. And after break-fast she does up all her work, washes her dishes and the immense milk-cans, sweeps cleans lamps and stoves, makes beds, et cetery, and feeds the chickens, and ducks, and turkeys. And by that time it is nine o'clock. Then she hurries round and washes and combs the three children, curls the hair of the twin girls, and then gets herself into her best clothes, and by that time she is so beat out that she is ready to drop down.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130944">"But she don't; she lifts the children into the democrat, climbs her own weary form in after 'em, and takes the youngest one in her lap. And Jim, havin' by this time got through with his work and toiled into his best suit, they drive off, a colt follerin' 'em, <pb xml:id="mhworld_130943" n="138 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>and Jim havin' to get out more'n a dozen times to head it right, and makin' Jane wild with anxiety, for it is a likely colt.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130945">"Wall, they go four milds and a half to the meetin'-house—there hain't no Free-well Baptist nearer to 'em, and they are strong in the belief, and awful sot on that's bein' the only right way. So they go to class-meetin' first, and both talk for quite a length of time; they are quite gifted, and are called so. And then they set up straight through the sermon, and that Free-well Baptist preaches more'n a hour, hot or cold weather, and then they both teach a large class of children, and what with takin' care of the three restless children, and their own weariness on the start, they are both beat out before they start for home. And Jane has a blindin' headache.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130946">"But she must keep up, for she has got to git the three babies home safe, and then there is dinner to get, and the dishes to wash, and the housework, and the out-door work to tend to, and what with her headache, and her tired-out nerves and body, and the work and care of the babies, Jane is cross as a bear—snaps everybody up, sets a bad pattern before her children and Jim—and, in fact, don't get over it and hain't good for anything before the middle of the week.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_130947" n="139 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_130948">"The day of rest is the hardest day, of the week for her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130949">"But she told me last night—she come in to get my bask pattern, she is anxious to get her parmetty dress done for the World's Fair—but she said that she shouldn't go if it wuz open Sunday, for her mind wuz so sot on havin' the Sabbath kep strict as a day of rest.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130950">"Now I believe in goin' to meetin' as much as anybody, and always have been regular.

I should have thought she would; and Lophemia Pegrum spoke up—she is a dretful pretty girl, but very sentimental and romantic, and talks out of poetry books. Sez she:</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130953">"Another thought: Nature works all the Sabbath day. Flowers bloom, their sweet perfume wafts abroad, bees gather the honey from their fragrant blossoms, the dews fall, the clouds sail on, the sun lights and warms the World, the grass grows, the grain ripens, the fruit gathers the sunshine in its golden and rosy globes, the birds sing, the trees rustle, the wind blows, the stars rise and set, the tide comes in and goes out, the waves wash the beach, and carries the great ships to <pb xml:id="mhworld_130952" n="140 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>their havens—in fact, Nature keeps her World's Fair open every day of the week just alike."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130954">"Yes," sez Miss Eben Sanders—she is always on the side of the last speaker—she hain't to be depended on, in argument.

And I d'no as it is takin' the idees of the Lord so much at first hand as it is to study the lesson of the Lilies He made, and which He loved and admired and told us to consider.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130972">"The World's Fair is full of all the beauty He made, more wonderful and more beautiful than the lilies, and I d'no as it is wrong to consider 'em Sundays or week days."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130973">"But," sez Miss Yerden, "don't you know what the Bible sez—'Forget not the assemblin' of yourselves together'?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130974">"Well," piped up Bub Lum, aged fourteen, and a perfect imp—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_130975">"I guess that if the Fair is open Sundays, folks that are there won't complain

I see that she wouldn't give up the idee.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301026">And besides the stockin's, which wuz goin' to devour a fearful amount of time, she had got to embroider three night-shirts for Whitfield with fine linen floss.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301027">Then I argued with her agin. Sez I, "Good land! I don't believe that Christopher Columbus ever had any embroidered night-shirts." Sez I, "If he had waited to have them embroidered, and shellwork stockin's knit, we might have not been discovered to this day. But," sez I "good, sensible creeter, he knew better than to do it when he had everything else on his hands. And", sez I, "with all your housework to do—and hot weather a-comin' on—I don't see how you are a-goin' to git 'em all done and git to the Fair."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301028">And she said, "She had ruther come late, prepared, than to go early with everything at loose ends."</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301029" n="152 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301030">"But," sez I, "good plain sensible night-shirts and Lyle-thread stockin's hain't loose—they hain't so loose as them you are knittin'."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301031">But I see that I couldn't break it up, so I desisted in my efforts.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301032">Maggie, though she is only my daughter-in-law, takes after me more in a good many things than Tirzah Ann duz, who is my own step-daughter. Curious, but so it is.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301033">Now, she and I felt jest alike in this.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301034">Who—who wuz a-goin' to notice what you had on to the World's Fair; and providin' we wuz clean and hull, and respectable-lookin', who wuz a-goin' to know or care whether our stockin's wuz open work or plain knittin'?</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301035">There, with all the wonder and glory of the hull world spread out before our eyes, and the hull world there a-lookin' at it, a-gazin' at strange people, strange customs, strange treasures and curiosities from every land under the sun—wonders of the earth and wonders of the sea, marvels of genius and invention, and marvels of grandeur and glory, of Art and Nature, and the hull world a-lookin' on, and a-marvellin' at 'em. And then to suppose that anybody would be a-lookin' out for shell-work stockin's, a-carin' whether they wuz clam-shell pattern, or oyster shell.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301036" n="153 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301037">The idee!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301038">That is the way Maggie and I felt; why, if you'll believe it, that sweet little creeter never took but one dress with her, besides a old wrapper to put on mornin's. She took a good plain black silk dress, with two waists to it—a thick one for cool days and a thin one for hot days—and some under-clothes, and some old shoes that didn't hurt her feet, and looked decent. And there she wuz all ready.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301039">She never bought a thing, I don't believe, not one. You wouldn't ketch her waitin' to embroider night-shirts for Thomas Jefferson—no, indeed! She felt jest as I did. What would the Christopher Columbus World's Fair care for the particular make of Thomas J's night-shirts? That had bigger things on its old mind than to stop and admire a particular posey or runnin' vine worked on a man's nightly bosom. Yes, indeed!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301040">But Tirzah Ann felt jest that way, and I couldn't make her over at that late day, even if I had time to tackle the job. She took it honest—it come onto her from her Pa.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301041">The preperations that man would have made if he had had his head would have outdone Tirzah Ann's, and that is sayin' enough, and more'n enough.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301043">And the size of the shoes that man would have <pb n="154 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="143" facs="mhworld143"/>sot out with if he had been left alone would have been a shame and a disgrace to the name of decency as long as the world stands.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301044">Why, his feet would have been two smokin' sacrifices laid on the altar of corns and bunions. Yes, indeed! But I broke it up.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301045">I sez, "Do you lay out and calculate to hobble round in that pair of leather vises and toe-screws," sez I, "when you have got to be on foot from mornin' till night, day after day? Why under the sun don't you wear your good old leather shoes, and feel comfortable?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301046">And he said (true father of Tirzah Ann), "He wuz afraid it would make talk."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301047">Sez I, "The idee of the World's Fair, with all it has got on its mind, a noticin'
or carin' whether you had on shoes or went barefoot! But if you are afraid of talk," sez I, "I guess that it would make full as much talk to see you a-goin' round a-groanin' and a-cryin' out loud. And that is what them shoes would bring you to," sez I.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301049">"Now," sez I, "you jest do them shoes right up and carry 'em back to the store, and if you have <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301048" n="155 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>got to have a new pair, git some that will be more becomin' to a human creeter, let alone a class-leader, and a perfessor, and a grandfather."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301050">So at last I prevailed—he a-forebodin' to the very last that it would make talk to see him in such shoes. But he got a pair that wuzn't more'n one size too small for him, and I presumed to think they would stretch some. And, anyway, I laid out to put his good, roomy old gaiters in my own trunk, so he could have a paneky to fall back on, and to soothe.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301051">As for myself, I took my old slips, that had been my faithful companions for over two years, and a pair of good big roomy bootees.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301052">I never bought nothin' new for any of my feet, not even a shoe-string. And the only new thing that I bought, anyway, wuz a new muslin nightcap with a lace ruffle.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301053">I bought that, and I spoze vanity and pride wuz to the bottom of it. I feel my own shortcomin's, I feel 'em deep, and try to repent, every now and then, I do.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301055">But I did think in my own mind that in case of fire, and I knew that Chicago wuz a great case for burnin' itself up—I thought in case of fire in the night I wouldn't want to be ketched with a <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301054" n="156 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>plain sheep's-head nightcap on, which, though comfortable, and my choice for stiddy wear, hain't beautiful.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301056">And I thought if there wuz a fire, and I wuz to be depictered in the newspapers as a-bein' rescued, I did feel a little pride in havin' a becomin' nightcap on, and not bein' engraved with a sheep's head on.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301057">Thinks'es I, the pictures in the newspapers are enough to bring on the cold chills onto anybody, even if took bareheaded, and what—what would be the horror of 'em took in a sheep's head!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301058">There it wuz, there is my own weakness sot right down in black and white. But, anyway, it only cost thirty-five cents, and there wuzn't nothin' painful about it, like Josiah's shoes, nor protracted, like Tirzah Ann's stockin's.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301059">Wall, Ury and Philury moved in the day before, and Josiah and I left in the very best of sperits and on the ten o'clock train, Maggie and Thomas Jefferson and Krit a-meetin' us to the depot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301061">Maggie looked as pretty as a pink, if she didn't make no preperations. She had on her plain waist, black silk, and a little black velvet turban, and she had pinned a bunch of fresh rosies to her waist, and the rosies wuzn't any pinker than her pretty <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301060" n="157 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>cheeks and lips, and the dew that had fell into them roses' hearts that night wuzn't any brighter than her sweet gray eyes.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301062">She makes a beautiful woman, Maggie Allen duz; and she ort to, to correspond with her husband, for my boy, Thomas Jefferson, is a young man of a thousand, and it is admitted that he is by all the Jonesvillians—nearly every villian of 'em admits it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301063">Tirzah Ann and the babe wuz to the depot to see us off, and she said that she should come on jest as soon as she got through with her preperations.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301064">But I felt dubersome about her comin' very soon, for she took out her knittin' work (we had to wait quite a good while for the cars), and I see that she hadn't got the first one only to the instep.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301065">It is slow knittin'—shells are dretful slow anyway—and she wuz too proud sperited to have 'em plain clam-shell pattern, which are bigger and coarser; she had to have 'em oyster-shell pattern, in ridges.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301066">Wall, as I say, I felt dubersome, but I spoke up cheerful on the outside—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301067">"If you git your stockin's done, Tirzah Ann, you must be sure and come."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301068">And she said she would.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301069">The way she said it wuz: "One, two, three, four, yes, mother; five, six, seven, I will."</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301070" n="158 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301071">She had to count every shell from top to toe of 'em, which made it hard and wearin' both for her and them she wuz conversin' with.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301072">Why, they do say—it come to me straight, too—that Whithfield got that wore out with them oyster-shell stockin's that he won't look at a oyster sence—he used to be devoted to 'em, raw or cooked; but they say that you can't git him to look at one sence the stockin' episode, specially scolloped ones.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301073">No, he sez "that he has had enough oysters for a lifetime."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301074">Poor fellow! I pity him. I know what them actions of hern is; hain't I suffered from the one she took 'em from?</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301075">But to resoom, and continue on.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301076">Miss Gowdey come to the depot to see me off, and so did Miss Bobbet and the Widder Pooler.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301077">Miss Gowdey wuz a-comin' to the World's Fair as soon as she made her rag-carpet for her summer kitchen; she said "she wouldn't go off and leave her work ondone, and she hadn't got more'n half of the rags cut, and she hadn't colored but-nut yet, nor copperas; she would not leave her house a-sufferin' and her rags oncut."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301078">I thought she looked sort o' reprovin' at me, for she knew that I had a carpet begun.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301079" n="159 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301080">But I spoke up, and sez, "Truly rags will be always here with us, and most likely but-nut and copperas; but the World's Fair comes but once in a lifetime, and I believe in embracin' it now, and makin' the most of it." Sez I, "We can embrace rags at any time."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301081">"Wall," she said, "she couldn't take no comfort with the memory of things ondone a-weighin' down on her." She said "some folks wuz different," and she looked clost at me as she said it. "Some folks could go off on towers and be happy with the thought of rags oncut and warp oncolored, or spooled, or anything. But she wuzn't one of 'em; she could not, and would not, take comfort with things ondone on her mind."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301082">And I sez, "If folks don't take any comfort with the memories of things ondone on 'em, I guess that there wouldn't be much comfort took, for, do the best we can in this world, we have to leave some things ondone. We can't do everything."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301083">"Wall," she said, "she should, never should, go off on towers till everything wuz done."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301084">And agin I sez, "It is hard to git everything done, and if folks waited for them circumstances, I guess there wouldn't be many towers gone off on."</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301085" n="160 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301086">But she didn't give in, nor I nuther. But jest then Miss Bobbet spoke up, and said, "She laid out to go to the World's Fair—she wouldn't miss it for anything; it wuz the oppurtunity of a lifetime for education and pleasure; but she wuz a-goin' to finish that borrow-and-lend bedquilt of hern before she started a step. And then the woodwork had got to be painted all over the house, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was so busy with his spring's work that she had got to do it herself."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301087">And I sez, "Couldn't you let those things be till you come back?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301088">And she said, "She couldn't, for she mistrusted she would be all beat out, and wouldn't feel like it when she got back; paintin' wuz hard work, and so wuz piecin' up."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301089">And I sez, "Then you had rather go there all tired out, had you?" sez I. "Seems to me I had ruther go to the World's Fair fresh and strong, and ready to learn and enjoy, even if I let my borrow-and-lend bedquilt go till another year. For," sez I, "bedquilts will be protracted fur beyend the time of seein' the World's Fair—and I believe in livin' up to my priveleges."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301091">And she said, "That she wouldn't want to put it off, for it had been a-layin' round for several years, <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301090" n="161 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>and she felt that she wouldn't go away so fur from home, and leave it onfinished."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301092">And I see that it wouldn't do any good to argy with her. Her mind wuz made up.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301093">Miss Pooler said, "That she wuz a-goin' to the Fair, and a-goin' in good season, too. She wouldn't miss it for anything in the livin' world. But she had got to make a visit all round to his relations and hern before she went. And," sez she, a-lookin' sort o' reproachful at me.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301094">"I should have thought you would have felt like goin' round and payin' 'em all a visit, on both of your sides, before you went," sez she. "They would have felt better; and I feel like doin' everything I can to please the relations."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301095">And I told Miss Pooler—"That I never expected to see the day that I hadn't plenty of relations on my side and on hisen, but I never expected to see another Christopher Columbus World's Fair, and I had ruther spend my time now with Christopher than with them on either side, spozin' they would keep."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301097">But Miss Pooler said, "She had always felt like doin' all in her power to show respect to the relations on both sides, and make 'em happy. And she felt that, in case of anything happenin', she would <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301096" n="162 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>feel better to know she had made 'em all a last visit before it happened."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301098">"What I am afraid will happen, Miss Pooler." sez I, "is that you won't git to the World's Fair at all, for they are numerous on both sides, and widespread," sez I. "It will take sights and sights of time for you to go clear round."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301099">But I see that she wuz determined to have her way, and I didn't labor no more with her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301100">And I might as well tell it right here, as any time—she never got to the World's Fair at all. For while she wuz a-payin' a last visit previous to her departure, she wuz took down bed-sick for three weeks. And the Fair bein' at that time on its last leglets, as you may say, it had took her so long to go the rounds—the Fair broke up before she got up agin.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301101">Miss Pooler felt awful about it, so they say; it wuz such a dretful disapintment to her that they had to watch her for some time, she wuz that melancholy about it, and depressted, that they didn't know what she would be led to do to herself.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301103">And besides her own affliction about the Fair, and the trouble she gin her own folks a-watchin' her for months afterwards, she got 'em mad at her on both sides. Seven different wimmen she kep to <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301102" n="163 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>home, jest as they wuz a-startin' for the Fair, and belated 'em.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301104">Eleven of the relations on her side and on hisen hain't spoke to her sence. And the family where she wuz took sick on their hands talked hard of suin' her for damage. For they wuz real smart folks, and had been makin' their calculations for over three years to go to the Fair, and had lotted on it day and night, and through her sickness they wuz kep to home, and didn't go to it at all.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301105">But to resoom.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301106">Jest as I turned round from Miss Pooler, I see Miss Solomon Stebbins and Arvilly Lanfear come in the depot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301107">Arvilly come to bid me good-bye, and Miss Stebbins wuz with her, and so she come in too.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301108">Arvilly said, " That she should be in Chicago to that World's Fair, if her life wuz spared." She said, "That she wouldn't miss bein' in the place where wimmen wuz made sunthin' of, and had sunthin' to say for themselves, not for ontold wealth."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301110">She said, "That she jest hankered after seein' one woman made out of pure silver—and then that other woman sixty-five feet tall; she said it would do her soul good to see men look up to her, and <pb n="164 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="164" facs="mhworld164"/>they have got to look up to her if they see her at all, for she said that it stood to reason that there wuzn't goin' to be men there sixty-five feet high.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301111">"And then that temple there in Chicago, dreamed out and built by a woman—the nicest office buildin' in the world! jest think of that—

But yet with a sort of a sad look underlyin' the fun, some as deep waters look under the frothy sparkle on top, as if they had secrets they might tell if they wuz a mind to—secrets of dark places down, fur down, where the sun doesn't shine; secrets of joy and happiness, and hope that had gone down, and wuz carried under the depths—under the depths that we hadn't no lines to fathom.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301274">No, if there wuz any secrets of sadness underlyin' the frank openness and pleasantness of them clear blue eyes, we hadn't none of us no way of tellin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301276">We hadn't no ways of peerin' down under the <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301275" n="192 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>clear blue depths, any further than he wuz willin' to let us.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301277">All we knew wuz, that though he looked happy and looked good-natured, back of it all, a-peerin' out sometimes when you didn't look for it, wuz a sunthin' that looked like the shadder cast from a hoverin' lonesomeness, and sorrow, and regret.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301278">But he wuz a good-lookin' feller, there hain't a doubt of that, and good actin' and smart.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301279">He wuz a bacheldor, and we could all see plain that Miss Plank held his price almost above rubies.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301280">If there wuz any good bits among vittles that wuz always good, it wuz Miss Plank's desire that he should have them bits; if there wuz drafts a-comin' from any pint of the compass, it wuz Miss Plank's desire to not have him blowed on.

Of course, not knowin' at that time that I favored his mother in my looks—his mother he had worshipped so that he kep her room jest as she left it, and wouldn't have a thing changed.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301356">But I didn't know that, as I say, and I said to my Josiah, after we went back into our room—</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301357" n="205 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301358">Sez I, "It must be that we do have a good look to us, Josiah Allen, or else that perfect stranger wouldn't treat us he has."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301359">"Perfect stranger!" sez Josiah.

And some, <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301383" n="209 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>too, he looked as if she wuz dead and buried, and he wuz a-mournin' deep for her, <hi rend="italic">very</hi> deep.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301385">As curious a look as I ever see; and if I hain't seen curious looks in my time, then I will say no-body has.

I have seen curious looks in my journey through life, curious as a dog, and curiouser.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301386">But there she stood, no matter what looks wuz cast on her from friend or foe—and I guess it would sound better to say from friend or lover, for nobody could be a foe to that radiant-faced, beautiful creeter.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301387">There she stood, in sun or shade, knee-deep in them fresh green grasses, a-lookin' off onto them sunset clouds always rosy and golden, by the side of that streamlet that always had the sparkle on its tiny waves.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301388">I might be tired and weak as a cat, and Mr. Freeman might have the headache, and Josiah Allen be cross, and all fagged out—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301389">But her face wuz always serene, and lit up with the glow of joy and health, and her sweet, deep eyes always held the secret that she couldn't be made to tell.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301391">Mr. Bolster was a stout, middle-aged man, with bald head, side whiskers, and a double chin. And <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301390" n="210 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>his big blue eyes kinder stood out from his face some. He was a real estate agent, so Miss Plank said. But his principal business seemed to be a-praisin' up Chicago, and a-puffin' up the World's Fair.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301392">Good land! Columbus didn't need none of his patronizin' and puffin' up, and Chicago didn't, not by his tell.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301393">Josiah wuz dretful irnpressed by him. We didn't lead off to the Fair ground the next day after our arrival. No; at my request, we took life easy—onpacked our trunks and got good and rested, and the mornin' follerin' we got up middlin' early, bein' used to keepin' good hours in Jonesville, and on goin' down to the breakfast-table we found that there wuzn't nobody there but Mr. Bolster. He always had a early breakfast, and drove his own horse into the city to his place of business.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301394">He looked that wide awake and active as if he never had been asleep, and never meant to.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301395">And my companion bein' willin', and Mr. Bolster bein' more than willin', they plunged to once into a conversation concernin' Chicago, Miss Plank and I a-listenin' to 'em some of the time, and some of the time a-talkin' on our own hook, as is the ways of wimmen.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301396" n="211 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301397">Mr. Bolster—and I believe he knew that we wuz from York State, and did it partly in a boastin' way—he begun most to once to prove that Chicago wuz the only place in America at all suitable to hold the World's Fair in.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301398">And I gin him to understand that I thought that New York would have been a good place for it, and it wuz a disapintment to me and to several other men and wimmen in the State to not have it there.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301399">But Mr. Bolster says, "Why, Chicago is the only place at all proper for it. Why," sez he, " in a way of politeness, Chicago is the only place for it. In what other city could the foreigners be welcomed by their own people as they can here?" Sez he—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301400">"In Chicago over 75 per cent of the population is foreign."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301401">"Yes," sez Josiah, with a air as if he had made population a study from his youth.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301402">But he didn't know nothin' about it, no more than I did.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301403">Sez Mr. Bolster, " Out of a population of a little over a million 200,000, we have nine hundred and 14,000 foreigners. That shows in itself that Chicago is the only city calculated to make our foreign friends feel perfectly at home."</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301404" n="212 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301405">"Yes," sez Josiah, " that is very true."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301406">But I sez to Miss Plank, "There is other folks I like jest as well as I do my relations, and if they had thought so much on 'em, why didn't they stay with 'em in the first place?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301407">And Miss Plank kinder looked knowin' and nodded her head; she couldn't swing right out free, as I could, bein' hampered by not wantin' to offend any of her boarders.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301408">Sez Mr. Bolster, "Chicago has the most energetic and progressive people in the world. It hain't made up, like a Eastern village, of folks that stay to home and set round on butter-tubs in grocery stores, talkin' about hens. No, it is made up of people who dared—who wuz too energetic, progressive, and ambitious, to settle down and be content with what their fathers had. And they struck out new paths for themselves, as the Pilgrim Fathers did.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301409">"And it is of these people, who represent the advancin' and progressive thought of the day, that Chicago is made up. It embodies the best energy and ambition of the Eastern States and of Europe."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301410">"Yes," sez Josiah, "that is jest so."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301411">And then, sez Mr. Bolster, "Chicago is, as is well known, in the very centre of the earth."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301412">"Yes," sez Josiah.</p><pb n="213 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="213" facs="mhworld213"/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301414">But I struck in here, and couldn't help it, and, sez I, "That is what Boston has always thought;" and, sez I, candidly, "That is what has always been thought about Jonesville."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301415">He looked pityin'ly at me, and, sez he, "Where is Jonesville?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301416">And I sez, "Jest where I told you, in the very centre of the earth, as nigh as we can make out."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301417">"How old is the place?" sez Mr. Bolster.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301418">Sez I proudly, " It is more than a hundred and fifty years old, for Uncle Nate Bently's grandfather built the first store there, and helped build the first Meetin'-House; and," sez I, "Uncle Nate is over ninety."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301419">"How many inhabitants has it?" sez he briskly.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301420">And then my own feathers had to droop; and as I paused to collect my thoughts, Josiah spoke up he is always so forward—and, sez he, "About 200 and 10 or 11."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301422">But I sez, with dignity, "Perhaps I know more <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301421" n="214 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>about some things than you do, Josiah. There may be, by this time, one or two more inhabitants."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301423">Sez Mr. Bolster, "A growth of about 200 in one hundred years! Chicago is about half as old, and has one million eight hundred thousand population. In ten years the population has increased 108 per cent, and property has increased in the same time 656 per cent, the greatest growth in the world."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301424">He regarded Jonesville as he would a fly in dog days. He went right by it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301425">"As I was saying, we say nothing about Chicago but what we can prove. Look on the map and you will see for yourself that Chicago is right in the centre of the habitable portion of North America. Put your thumb down on Chicago, and then sweep round it in an even circle with your middle finger, and you will see that it takes in with that sweep all the settled portion of North America."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301426">"Yes," sez Josiah, with a air as if he had proved it with his thumb and finger, time and agin, but he hadn't no such thing.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301427">Sez Mr. Bolster, "We say nothing about our City that we can't prove. As Chicago is in the very centre of productive North America, so it is the centre of population of the United States.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301429">"It is the centre of the raw materials for manu-<pb xml:id="mhworld_1301428" n="215 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>factures, cotton, wool, metals, coal, gas, oil fields, all sorts of food. And as it is the centre of supply, so it is of distribution—60 railroads and branches bring freight and carry out manufactured products to every part of the country—to say nothing of the great number of lines of water transportations—connecting with all parts of the world. Why, last year Chicago had 50 per cent more arrivals and clearances than New York. It is the greatest shipping place in America. And," sez Mr. Bolster, "not only can we prove that Chicago is the centre of the world for manufactures, but it is the healthiest place to live in."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301430">And then agin I spoke out, and, sez I, "I always hearn that it was built on low, swampy ground."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301431">"Yes," sez Mr. Bolster cheerfully, "that is the reason why it is healthy. The ground was originally low and wet, and so it was elevated, filled in. Why, just before the great fire we lifted up all the houses, in the best part of the city, on jack-screws for eight feet, and filled the ground under them. The idea of lifting up a whole city eight feet and making new ground under it! There never was such an undertaking before since the world began.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301433">"And then the fire come, and the city was re-built just as we wanted it. Why, the death-rate of <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301432" n="216 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>Chicago is lower than almost any city of the world except London—it is just about the same as that. Then," sez he, "our climate is perfect; it is so temperate and even that folks don't have to spend all their energies in keeping warm, as they do in colder climates, nor is it so warm that they have to spend their vital energies in fanning themselves."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301434">Sez Josiah, "I had ruther mow a beaver medder in dog days than to fan myself—it wouldn't tire me so much."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301435">Sez Mr. Bolster, "The climate is <hi rend="italic">just</hi> right to call forth the prudent saving qualities to provide for the winter; and warm enough to keep them happy and cheerful looking forward to bounteous harvests."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301436">"Wall," sez I, "it got burnt up, anyway."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301437">It fairly provoked me to see him look down so on all the rest of the world.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301439">"Yes," sez he, " that is another evidence of the city's marvellous power and resources. Find me another city, if you can, where in a few hours 200 millions of dollars were burnt up, two thousand 100 acres burnt over, right in the heart of a big city, with a loss of two hundred and ninety million dollars, and then to have it spring up in a marvellously short time—not only as <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301438" n="217 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>good as new, but infinitely better; so much better that the disaster proved to be an untold blessing to the city."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301440">Truly, as I see, swamps couldn't dround out his self-conceit, nor fire burn it up.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301441">And I knew myself that Chicago had great reason to be proud of her doin's, and I felt it in my heart, only I couldn't bear to see Mr. Bolster act so haughty.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301442">And I sez to my pardner, Nvith quite a lot of dignity, "I guess it is time we are goin', if we get to the Fair in any season."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301443">And Mr. Bolster to once told us what way would be best for us to go. A good-natured creeter he is, without any doubt.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301444">But jest as we wuz startin' I happened to think of a errent that had been sent me by Jim Mee-sick, he that wuz Philura Meesick's brother.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301445">He wanted to get a place to work somewhere in Chicago, through the Fair, so's to pay his way, and gin him a chance to go to the Fair.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301446">I had already asked Miss Plank about it, but she didn't know of no openin' for him, and I happened to think, mebby Mr. Bolster, seein' he knew everything else, might know of a place where Jim could get work.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301447" n="218 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301448">And, sez I, " He is handy at anything, and I spoze there are lots of folks here in Chicago that hire help. I spoze some of 'em have as many as four or five hired men apiece."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301449">Sez I, " There are them in Jonesville, durin' the summer time, who employ as high as two men by the day, besides the regular hired man, and I spoze it is so here."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301450">Yes," sez he; "Mr. Pullmen has five thousand four hundred and fifty hired men, and Philip Armoor has seven thousand seven hundred and seventy-five."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301451">Wall, there wuz no more to be said. Bolster had done what he sot out to do—he had lowered my pride down lower than the Queen of Sheba's ever wuz, by fur. I had no sperit left in me. He might have gone on to me by the hour, and I not sensed it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301452">But I didn't let on how I felt. I only sez weakly, "Wall, they hain't a-sufferin' for help, I guess, and I'll write to Philura so."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301453">But Bolster, good-natured agin, sez, "I will look round, and see what I can do for him." And he snatched out a note-book, and writ his name down. And I thanked him, and weakly follered my companion from the room.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301454" n="219 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301455">And I felt that if the door had been much smaller I could have got out of it. I felt very diminutive—very—almost tiny. But I got over it pretty soon. I felt about my usial size as we descended the stairs and stood on the steps, ready to sally out and take the street cars that wuz to transport our bodys to the Christopher Columbus World's Fair.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301456">But while we wuz a-standin' there a-lookin' round to see jest which wuz the best way to go to get to the corner Miss Plank had directed us to, Mr. Bolster come down the steps spry and active as a young cat, and, sez he—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301457">"My carriage is waiting to take me to my orfice, and I will be glad to take you both in, and take you past some of our city sights, and I will leave you at a station where the train will take you right to the grounds."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301458">So we accepted his offer, Josiah with joy and I with a becomin' dignity, and the carriage sot off down the street.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301460">And what follers truly seems like a dream to me, and so duz the talk accompanyin' it. The tall buildin's we looked at, one of 'em 260 feet high, 20 storys—elevators that carry 40,000 passengers—and a garden on the roof, a garden 260 feet in the air, <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301459" n="220 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>where you can set and talk and eat nut-cakes, and fried oysters—the idee!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301461">And then the block that Mr. Bolster said wuz the largest business block in the world, it accomidated 6000 people. And then we went by big meetin'-housen, and other big housen, whose ruffs seemed so high that it seemed as if you could stand up on the chimblys and shake hands with the man in the moon, and neighbor with him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301462">And then the talk I hearn—22 miles of river frontage sweepin' up from the lake into the heart of the city, where the giant elevators unload their huge traffic. He told us what the revenue of the city wuz yearly, $25,000,000, 25 millions—the idee!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301463">And Jonesville, fifty years older than Chicago, thinks she has done well if she has 3 dollars and 25 cents in her treasury.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301464">Why, that man used so many immense sums in his talk, that I got all muddled up, and a ort seemed to me almost like a million—I felt queer.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301466">And then the system of Parks and Boulevards, the finest in the world—100 miles of them beautiful pleasure drives. I believe, from what I see afterwards, that he told the truth, for no city, it seems to me, could improve on that long, broad, beautiful way, smooth and tree-bordered, edged with <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301465" n="221 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>stately homes, leadin' into the matchless beauty of the Parks.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301467">But anon, when I felt that I wuz bein' crushed down beneath a gigantic weight of figgers, and estimates, elevators, population, hite, depth, under-ground tunnels, and systems of drainage—though every one of 'em wuz a grand and likely subject and awful big—but I felt that I wuz a-bein' crushed by 'em—I felt that the Practical, the Real wuz a crushin' me down—the weight, and noise, and size of the mighty iron wheel of Progress, that duz roll faster in Chicago than in any other place on earth, it seems to me. But I felt so trodden down by it, and flattened out, that I thought I would love to see sunthin' or other different, sunthin' kinder spiritual, and meditate a spell on some of the onseen forces that underlays all human endeavor.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301468">So, at my request, we went out of our way a little, so I could set my eyes on that Temple dreamed out by a woman and wrought a good deal by faith, some like the walls of Jericho, only different, for whereas they fell by faith, this wuz riz up by it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301469">And my feelin's as I looked at that Temple wuz large and noble-sized as you will find anywhere.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301471">A Temple consecrated not so much to the Al-mighty in Heaven, who don't need it, as to God in <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301470" n="222 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>Humanity—to the help of the Divine as it shows itself half buried and lost in the clay of the human—a help to relieve the God powers from the trammels of the fiend—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301472">A Temple—not so much to set, and pray, and sing in, about the beauties of our Heavenly home, as to build up God's kingdom on earth, show forth His praise in helpin' His poor, and weak, and sinful.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301473">My feelin's wuz a sight—a sight to behold, as I sot and looked at it—that tall, noble, majestic pile, and thought of the way it wuz built, and what it wuz built for.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301474">But as we drove on agin, my mind got swamped once more in a sea of immense figgers that swashed up agin me—elevators that carry grain up to the top of towerin' buildin's, 10,000 bushels a hour, and then come down its own self and weigh itself, and I guess put itself into bags and tie 'em up—though he didn't speak in particuler about the tyin' up.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301475">And then he praised their stores—one of 'em which employed 2,000,400 men. And then he praised up their teliphone system, so perfect that nothin' could happen in any part of the city without its bein' known to once at police headquarters.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301477">And then he praised up agin and agin the busi-<pb xml:id="mhworld_1301476" n="223 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>ness qualities and go-ahead-it-ivness of the people, and how property had riz.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301478">"Why," sez he, "Chicago and three hundred miles around it wuz bought for five shillings not so long ago as your little town was founded, and now, look at the uncounted millions it represents."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301479">And then he boasted about the Board of Trade, and said its tower wuz 300 feet high. And, sez he, " While folks all over the world are prayin' for their daily bread, the men inside that building was deciding whether they could get it or not."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301480">And after he tallied about everything else connected with Chicago, and hauled up figgers and heaped 'em up in front of me till my brain reeled, and my mind tottered back, and tried to lean onto old Rugers' Rithmatick—and couldn't, he wuz so totally inadequate to the circumstances—he mentioned "that they had 6000 saloons in Chicago, and made twenty-one million barrels of beer in a year.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301482">"Wall," sez I, a-turnin' round in the buggy, "my brain has been made a wreck by the figgers you have brung up and throwed at me about the noble, progressive doin's of Chicago, and," sez I firmly, " I wuz willin' to have it, for I respect and honor the people who could do such wonders, and keep <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301481" n="224 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>on a-doin' 'em, to the admiration of the world. But," sez I, "my brain <hi rend="italic">shall not</hi> totter under none of your beer and whiskey statisticks." And as I spoke I put my hand to my foretop, and I looked quite bad, and truly I felt so.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301483">He glanced at me, and see that I wuz not in a situation to be trifled with.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301484">And as we wuz jest approachin' the station where we wuz to be left, he ceased his remarks, and held his horse in.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301485">He helped me to alight, and I thanked him for his kindness, and acted as polite as a person could whose brain lay a wreck in the upper part of her head. The last word Mr. Bolster said to us wuz, as he gathered up the reins, sez he:</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301486">"Thirty-six lines of cars come to and leave Chicago, which, with its immense shipping facilities, makes it the—"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301487">But the cars tooted jest then, and I didn't hear his last words, and I wuz glad on't, as I say, I had thanked him before.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301488">But good land! he would have carried two giraffes or camels willin'ly if he could have got 'em into his buggy, and sot 'em up by him on the seat, and could have boasted to 'em understandin'ly about Chicago.

And the other panel, by Miss Lydia Emmet, shows the interior of a studio, with young females a-studyin' different arts that are useful and ornamental, and calculated to help themselves and the world along. At the north end of this great gallery is a large panel by Mrs. MacMonnies, wife of the sculptor, representin' Primitive Wimmen. A-showin', plain as nobody less gifted than she could, jest how primitive wimmen used to be.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301720">Opposite, on the south side, is a companion piece by Miss Cassette, of Paris, called Modern Wimmen, and a-showin' up first rate how fur wimmen have emerged from the shadders of the past.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301721">The centre panel depicters a orchard covered with bright green grass, and graceful female wimmen a-gatherin' apples offen the tree.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301722">Apples of knowledge, I spoze, but different from Eve's—fur different; these wuz peaceful Knowledge, Literature, Art, and all beautiful and useful industries.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301723" n="261 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301724">A smaller panel describes Music and Dancin' in a charmin' way.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301725">On the other side of the central panel are several maidens pursuin' a flyin' figger.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301726">Mebby it wuz the Ideal. If it wuz, I wuz glad to see them young females a-follerin' it up so clost. But girls will be more apt to catch her, when they leave off cossets, and long trains, and high-heeled shoes (metafor). But these seemed to be a-doin' the best they could, anyway.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301727">A border in rich colors went all round the picture, and in the corners wuz medallions all full of sweet babies—perfect cherubs of loveliness.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301728">In some things the picture mebby could have been bettered a little—mebby the ladder wuzn't quite stiddy enough—mebby I should ruther have not clumb up it. But the colorin' of the picture is superb. So rich and gorgus that it put me in mind of our own Jonesville woods in September, when you look off into the maple forests, and your eyes would fairly be dazzled with the blaze of the colors, if they wuzn't so soft and rich, and blended into each other so perfect.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301729">Yes, Miss Cassette done real well, and so did Mrs. MacMonnies, too.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301731">And all round this room hung pictures that filled <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301730" n="262 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>me with delight, and the proudest kind of pride, to think my own sect had done 'em all—had branched out into such noble and beautiful branchin's, for the statutes wuz jest as impressive as the pictures. There wuz one statute in the centre of the main corridor that I liked especially.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301732">It wuz Maud Muller. As I looked on Maud, I thought I could say with the Judge, when he first had a idee of payin' attention to her—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301733">"A sweeter face I ne'er have seen." And I thought, too, I could read in Maud's face a sort of a sad look, as if the shadder Pride, and Fate, held above her, wuz sort o' shadin' her now. Miss Blanche Nevins done first rate, and I'd loved to told her so.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301734">And then there wuz a statute of Elaine that rousted up about every emotion I had by me.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301735">There she wuz, "Elaine the fair," the lovable, the lily maid of Astolot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301736">I always thought a sight of her, and I've shed many a tear over her ontimely lot. I knew she thought more of Mr. Lancelot than she'd ort to, specially he bein' in love with a married woman at the same time.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301737">Her face looked noble, and yet sweet, riz up jest as it must have been when she argued with her pa about the man she loved.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301738" n="263 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><q>"Never yet was noble man, but made ignoble talk;</q><q>He makes no friends who never made a foe."</q><p xml:id="mhworld_1301739">And down under the majesty of her mean wuz the tenderness and pathos of her own little song; for, as Alfred Tennyson said, and said well, "Sweetly could she make, and sing."</p><q>"Sweet is true love, though given in vain, in vain; And sweet is Death, who puts an end to pain. I know not which is sweeter—no, not I."</q><p xml:id="mhworld_1301740">There wuzn't hardly a dry eye in my head as I stood a-lookin' at Elaine.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301741">And jest at this wropped moment I heard some voices nigh me that I recognized a-sayin' in glad and joyous axents, "How do you do, Josiah Allen's Wife?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301742">I turned and met seven glad extended hands, and thirteen eyes lookin' at mine, in joyous welcome, besides one glass eye (and you couldn't tell the difference, it wuz so nateral—Oren bought the best one money could git when his nigh eye wuz put out by a steer gorin' it). Yes, it wuz Oren Rumble and Lateza, his wife, and the hull of the family—the five girls, Barthena, Calfurna, Dalphina, Albiny, and Lateza.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301743" n="264 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301744">But what a change had swep' over the family sence I had last looked on 'em!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301745">I could hardly believe my two eyes when I looked at their costooms, for the hull family had dressed in black for upwards of' leven years, and Jonesvillians had got jest as ust to seein' 'em as they wuz a-seein' a flock of crows in the spring.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301746">And I do declare it wuz jest as surprisin' to me to see the way they wuz rigged out as it would be to see a lot of crows a-settlin' down on our cornfield with red and yeller tail feathers.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301747">To home they didn't go nowhere, only to meetin'—the mother bein' very genteel, comin' down as she did from a very old and genteel family. Dretful blue blood I spoze her folks had—blue as indigo, I spoze. And she didn't think it wuz proper to go into society in mournin' clothes—she thought it would make talk for mourners to git out and enjoy themselves any in crape.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301748">Oren wuz naterally of a lively disposition, and loved to visit round, and it made it bad for him. But he felt quite proud of marryin' such a aristo cratic woman, and so he had to take the bitter with the sweet.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301750">Besides their bein' so old, she had come from a mournin' family—her folks always mourned for <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301749" n="265 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>everybody and everything they could. (You know some families are so, and I spoze they git some comfort out of it. And black duz look real respectable, but considerable gloomy.)</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301751">Their house wuz always shet up, and Oren walked round (rebellin' inside) under a mournin' weed.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301752">And the six wimmen was all swathed in crape, and the hull house smelt of crape and logwood.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301753">As I sez more formally, Lateza was brung up to it. She wuz ready to mourn on the slightest pretext, and mourn jest as long and stiddy as possible.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301754">Wall, black <hi rend="italic">wuz</hi> becomin' to her. Bein' tall and spindlin', black sot her off, and crape draperies sort o' rounded off her figger and made her look some impressive.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301755">And she loved to stay at home—she wuz made that way.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301756">But I always felt that if she wanted to make a raven of herself for life, she no need to dye the feathers of the hull family in logwood, and tie 'em all up clost to the nest.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301757">Oren had chafed aginst it bitterly, but he bore the sable yoke until the youngest girl, Lateza (and mebby she inherited some of the aristocratic sotness of her mother with the name)—</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301758" n="266 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301759">Anyway, when she come home from school she come dressed in gay colors. She had on a yeller woosted dress with sky-blue trimmin's, a pink hat, a lilock veil, and a bunch of flowers in her bosom—too many colors to look well, but she did it to break her yoke.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301760">This kinder stunted the mother, so she wuz easier to handle, bein' kinder dazed.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301761">So they took her off to a Christian Science meet-in', and got her converted the first thing.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301762">This broke her chain, for they don't believe in mournin' as one without hope, and they believe in wanderin' round and seein' the beautiful world all you can, and takin' some comfort while you are in it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301763">So while the zeal of the convert wuz on her, and she didn't feel like disputin', the girls made her some red dresses, and some yeller ones, and had some white streamers put onto a white bunnet she had. And they bought themselves the most gorgeous and gay clothin' Jonesville and Loontown afforded. Oren is well off, and he wouldn't stent' em in such a cause as this—no, indeed!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301764">And Oren bought some bright, gay-lookin' suits, and some brilliant neckties—pale blue silk, with red polka dots on 'em, and some otter-colored ones.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301766">He had on the day we met him a bright plaid <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301765" n="267 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>suit and a red necktie spangled with yeller, hangin' out kinder loose in front.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301767">And Oren bought a three-seated carriage, and they jest scoured the hull country—went to all the parties they could hear on, and the fairs, and camp-meetin's, and such. They wuz on the go the hull time; and Lateza Alzina got to likin' it as much as Oren did.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301768">I don't spoze they wuz to home hardly enough to eat their meals whilst they wuz in Jonesville; they had a good hired girl, so they wuz free to wander all they wuz a mind to.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301769">This summer Lateza Alzina told me that they had been up to the upper end of Canada and British America on a tower, and come home round by Lake Champlain, and Lake George, and Saratoga; they'd stayed there three weeks, and then they went home and hurried and got ready for the Fair. They come the first day it wuz opened in the mornin', and laid out to go home the last day of the Fair along in the night, so Oren said.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301770">They all looked real happy, but some fagged out from seein' so much.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301771">I'm dretful afraid that the pendulum, havin' swung too fur on one side, is a-goin' too fur on the other; it is nater.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301772" n="268 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301773">But mebby they'll settle down and be more me-gum when the pendulum gits kinder settled down some, and its vibration ceases to be so vibratin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301774">Anyway, I'm glad to see 'em a-steppin' out of their weeds, and I told 'em so.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301775">Sez I, "You wuz in mournin' a awful while, wuzn't you?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301776">Oren fairly gritted his teeth, and before Lateza Alzina could speak, he busted out—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301777">"By Vum! I've mourned all I'm a-goin' to! I've staid penned up in the house all I'm a-goin' to!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301778">"I've quit it, by Vum! First my stepfather passed away. I never liked him—he always imposed on me; but we all went into deep mournin', staid out of society—jest shet ourselves up in a black jail for years.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301779">"Then my mother-in-law left me—then three years more of solid black and solid stayin' to home.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301780">"Then, at the end of the third year, we kinder quit off and begun to creep out a little and kinder lighten ourselves up a little; but then my wife's brother that she never see died way out to California and left a big property, but not a cent to us.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301781">"But the rest of the family wanted to mourn, so my wife had to foller on and mourn too.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301782">"And there it wuz agin, another time of gloom—another time of stayin' to home.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301783" n="269 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301784">"Time after time, jest as we got out a little, we had to plunge back into gloom agin.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301785">"But now we're out of it, and by Heavens and earth we're a-goin' to stay out! There hain't a-goin' to be any more mournin' done in this family—not if I know myself, there hain't."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301786">But I sez, "Oren, don't talk so; folks <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to mourn; this is a World of trials, and grief is nateral to it."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301787">"Wall, I'll mourn in pepper and salt, and I'll mourn out-doors. I hain't a-goin' to wind myself up in crape, and shet myself up in a black hole no more, mourn or not mourn.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301788">"And I'm a-goin' to laugh when I want to." And he jest laid his head back and bust out into a horse-laugh at nothin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301789">But they didn't seem to mind it; I guess they wuz ust to it, and the girls kinder put in and laughed too. Lateza Alzina didn't laugh out loud, but she kinder snickered some.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301790">It made me feel queer.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301791">I see—I see the truth; the bow had been drawed too tight back, and now it wuz a-goin' to shoot too fur—way over the mark.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301792">But still I felt that Oren had some truth on his side.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1301793" n="270 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1301794">And I sez, "I always felt that you shet yourselves up too much and mourned too deep."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301795">"Wall," sez Lateza Alzina, "my folks always brung me up to think that it would be apt to make talk if folks went out any while they wuz in black."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301796">"Wall," sez I, "I always felt that folks had better set down and calculate which would be the most agreeable to 'em, to shet themselves up and lose their health, and die, or to let folks talk.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301797">"And then act on them thoughts, and do as they want to with fear and tremblin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301798">"And," sez I, "folks would talk whilst you wuz dyin', anyway; you can't keep folks from talkin'." Sez I, "Like as not they'd say it wuz a guilty conscience that made you droop round and stay to home so."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301799">"Wall," sez Lateza Alzina, "I wuz brought up to think that it showed so much respect to them that wuz gone to stay to home in black."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301800">"Wall," sez I, "if the ones that wuz gone loved you, they would want you to git all the consolation you could whilst you wuz parted. Jest as a mother lets her child have some picture-books to comfort it while she leaves it a spell.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301802">"And if you loved them," sez I, "their memory would go out-doors with you, and go back into the

You would see the beloved face lookin' down at you from every mountam you would climb, and the shadder of their form would seem to appear in the mist of every valley. Every sunset would gleam with the smilin' light of their eyes, and every sunrise would begen to you, tellin' you that one more night had gone, and you wuz so much nearer to the Eternal Reunion.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301803">"Folks don't have to stay indoors to remember, Lateza. I have remembered folks out-doors, it seems to me, more than I ever did in the house.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301804">"And the voice you loved would seem to be a-tellin' you, 'Keep well, beloved, so you can do some of my day's work I had to lay down, as well as your own, and the meetin' will be all the gladder and more joyous.'</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301805">"And as for puttin' on black, the dear remembered voice seems to be a-sayin' to me, 'Don't put on the symbol of sorrow for one who has found the very secret of happiness, who has left the dark shadders and has gone into the great brightness. Don't carry the idee to the world that you have lost me, for I am nearer to you than I ever could have been on earth, for the clay has only fell off from my soul, leavin' the barrier but thin indeed between us now.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1301807">"'Don't act as if you wuz mournin' for me, dear <pb xml:id="mhworld_1301806" n="272 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>heart.

The temple is a gorgeous-lookin' one, but queer as anything—as anything I ever see.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302742">But then, on the other hand, I spoze them Japans would call the Jonesville meetin'-house queer; for what is strange in one country is second nater in another.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302743">This temple is built with one body and two wings, to represent the Phœnix—or so they say; the wood part wuz built in Japan and put up here by native Japans, brung over for that purpose.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302744">It is elaborate and gorgeous-lookin' in the extreme, and the gorgeousness a-differin' from our gorgeousness as one star differeth from a rutabaga turnip.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302745">Not that I mean any disrespect to Japan or the United States by the metafor, but I had to use a strong one to show off the difference.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302747">In one wing of the temple is exhibited articles from one thousand to four thousand years old—old <pb xml:id="mhworld_1302746" n="403 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>bronzes, and arms, and first attempts at pottery and lacquer.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302748">Some of these illustrate arts that are lost fur back in the past—I d'no how or where, nor Josiah don't.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302749">In the other wing are Japan productions four hundred years old, showin' the state of the country when Columbus sot out to discover their country; for it wuz stories of a wonderful island—most probable Japan—that wuz one thing that influenced Columbus strong.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302750">In the main buildin' are sights and sights of goods from Japan at the present day.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302751">All of the north part of the island is a marvellous show of their skill and ingenuity in landscape gardenin', and dwarf trees, and the wonderful garden effects for which they are noted.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302752">They make a present of the temple and all of these horticultural works to Chicago.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302753">To remain always a ornament of Jackson Park, which I call very pretty in 'em.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302754">Take it all together, the exhibits of Japan are about as interesting as that of any country of the globe.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302756">In some things they go ahead of us fur.

Some on 'em wuz dressed like Jonesvillians, but others had their queer-shaped clothin', and dretful ornamental. Josiah wuz bound to have a sack embroidered like one of theirn, and some wooden shoes, and caps with tossels—he thought they wuz dressy—and he wanted some big sleeves that he could use as a pocket; and then sez he—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302762">"To have shoes that have a separate place for the big toe, what a boon for that dum old corn on that toe of mine that would be!"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302763">But I frowned on the idee; but sez he—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1302765">"If you mind the expense, I could take one of your old short night-gowns and color it black, and

There wuz everything that could be thought on, or that ever wuz seen in the form of fishin' apparatus—every kind of hook, and spear, and rod, and queer-lookin' baskets and pots, and tackle to catch eels and lobsters, and then there wuz models of fishin' boats and vessels, and everything else under the sun that any fisherman ever sot eyes on, from Josiah back to the Postles, and from the Postles down to any fishin' club in 1893.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303244">Why, if you'll believe it—and I d'no as I <pb xml:id="mhworld_1303243" n="464 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>would blame you if you wouldn't, it bein' a fish story, as it were—but we did see some fish-hooks from Pompeii that had been buried 2000 years, and come out fish-hooks after all—a good deal like them Josiah uses in Jonesville creek.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303245">And speakin' of old things, we see some fishes that day—the oldest in the world; they come from Colorado—dug out of the rocks of ages ago; they wuz covered with bone instead of scales, which showed that they had had a pretty hard time on't.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303246">And then there wuz a big collection of nets made by the Indians from seal sinew, seal-skin braided, roots of willow tree, and whalebone.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303247">Of these last it took four men three weeks to make one, and two of these wuz gin in exchange for a jug of molasses to make rum with.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303248">A shame and a disgrace!

And indeed I see on comin' to myself that the hull 5000, and their relations on both sides, wuz on the move, and it wuz time for me to disembark myself, which I proceeded to do, a-follered by the forms of my Josiah and Miss Plank.

And I didn't think it wuz 
anything wrong, for good land! we are called uncle and aunt, my Josiah and me are, by lots of folks that hain't no sort of kin to us, and Isabelle wuz related to us anyway by kin and by soul ties.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303784">Wall, to resoom: the evenin' after Isabelle got there it wuz burnin' warm in my room.

It wuzn't a cry nor a sithe, but it wuz sunthin' different from both, more eager like, and deadly earnest, and dumbfoundered.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303791">And then it wuz Mr. Freeman's voice I knew that said—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303792">"My God! am I a-dreamin'?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303793">And then Isabelle turned, and her face filled with a rapturous surprise and joy, and everything.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303794">And sez she—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303795">"Tom!"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303796">And he jest rushed forward, and in a secent had her in his arms.

I felt that we wuz in the palace of the Great Enchanter, the King of Wonders of the 19th century, and I knew that orr and silence wuz befittin' mantillys to wrop ourselves in as we entered his court, and stood in his imperial presence.

I can't git a apron or a sun-bunnet on him in churnin' time or berryin' in dog-days—he is sot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303945">But I sez, "Josiah, I spoke in metafor."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303946">And he sez, "I would ruther you would use pan-taloons and vests, if you are a-goin' to allegore about me."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303947">But to resoom. France, England, Germany, all have wonderful exhibits, and as for our own country, there wuz no end seemin'ly to the marvellous sight.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303948">Why, to give you a idee of the size and splendor of 'em, one electrical company alone spent 350,000 dollars on its exhibit.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303949">Among the German exhibits wuz a wonderful search-light—jest as searchin' as any light ever could be—it wuz sunthin' like the day of judgment in lightin' up and showin' forth.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303950">One of the strange things long to be remembered wuz to set down alone beside of a big horn in Chicago and hear a melodious orkestry in New York, hundreds and hundreds of miles away, a-discoursin' the sweetest melody.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303951">Wall, what took up Josiah's mind most of anything wuz a house all fitted up from basement to attic with electricity.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1303952" n="560 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1303953">You come home (say you come in the evenin' and bring company with you); you press a button at the door, the door opens; touch another button, and the hall will be all lighted up, and so with every other room in the house. Some of these lights will be rosettes of light let into the wall, and some on 'em lamps behind white, and rose-tinted, and amber porcelain.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303954">When you go upstairs to put on another coat, you touch a button, the electric elevator takes you to your room; and when you open the closet door, that lights the lamp in the closet; when you have found your coat and vest, shuttin' the door puts the light out.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303955">In the mean time, your visitors down below are entertained by a selection from operatic or sacred music or comic songs from a phonograph on the parlor table. Or if they want to hear Gladstone debate, or Chauncey Depew joke, or Ingersoll lecture, or no matter what their tastes are, they can be gratified. The phonograph don't care; it will bring to 'em anything they call for.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303956">Then, when they have got ready for dinner, a button is touched; the dinner comes down from the kitchen in the attic, where it wuz all cooked by electricity, baked, roasted, or biled, whatever it is.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1303957" n="561 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1303958">When the vittles are put on the table, they are kept warm by electric warmin' furnaces.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303959">They start up a rousin' fire in the open fireplace by pressin' a button, and if they git kinder warm, electric fans cool the air agin, though there hain't much chance of gittin' too warm, for electric thermostats regulate the atmosphere. But in the summer the fans come handy.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303960">When dinner is over the dishes mount upstairs agin, and are washed by a electric automatic dish washer, and dried by a electric dish drier.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303961">The ice for dinner is made by a miniature ammonia ice plant, which keeps the hull house cool in hot days and nights.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303962">On washin' days the woman of the house throws the dirty clothes and a piece of soap into a tub, and electricity heats the water, rubs and cleanses the clothes, shoves 'em along and rings 'em through an electric ringer, and dries 'em in a electric dryin' oven, and then irons 'em by an electric ironin' machine.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303963">If the female of the house wants to sew a little, she don't have to wear out her own vital powers a-runnin' that sewin' machine—no; electricity jest runs it for her smooth as a dollar.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303964">If she wants to sweep her floor, does she have to wear out her own elbows?

We shouldn't live through it a week, even if you could git the machinery a-runnin'."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303973">"Wall," sez he, with a wise, shrewd look, "as fur as the elevator is concerned, I believe I could fix that on a endless chain—keep it a-runnin' all the time, sunthin' like perpetual motion."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303974">"How could we git on it?" sez I coldly.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303975">"Catch on," sez he; "it would be worth everything to both on us to make us spry and limber-jinted."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303976">"Oh, shaw!" sez I; "your idees are luny—luny as can be; it has got to go by electricity."</p><pb n="563 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="563" facs="mhworld563"/><p xml:id="mhworld_1303978">"Wall," sez he, "I never see any sharper lightnin' than we have to Jonesville.

I never in my hull life tried to do sunthin' remarkable and note-worthy but what you put a drag on to me."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303981">Sez I, "I have saved your life, Josiah Allen, time and agin, to say nothin' of my own."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303982">He wuz mad, but I drawed his attention off onto a ocean cable, and asked him to explain it to me how the news went; and he wuz happy once more—happier than I wuz by fur. I wuz wretched, and had got myself into a job of weariness onspeakable and confusion, etc., and so forth.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303983">But to such immense sacrifices will a woman's love lead her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303984">I could not brook his dallyin' with lightnin' at his age or to have

It lights the red, then the white, and then the blue, and etc., and then it goes on and lights the four branches until it gits to the end, and then it lights up a big ball.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303988">And then it goes back to the beginnin' agin, and so it goes on—flash! flash! flash! sparkle! sparkle! sparkle! in glowin' colors. It is a sight to see it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1303989">But what impressed me beyend anything wuz what seemed a mighty onseen hand a-risin' up out of Nowhere, and a-holdin' a pencil, and a-writin' on the wall in letters of flame. And then that same onseen hand will wipe out what has been writ, and write sunthin' else. Why, it all makes folks feel a good deal like Belschazarses, only more riz up like.

He paid his own hills, wuz modest, and intelligent, wanted to git information instead of idolatry from the American people. He didn't want no ball, no bowin' and backin' off—no escort. No chance at all here for the Ward McAllisters to show off, and act.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304127">He acted like a good sensible American man, some as our son Thomas Jefferson would act if he should go over to his neighborhood on business.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304128">He wanted to see for himself the life of the Americans, the way the common people lived—he wanted to git information to help his own people.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304129">And he wanted to see Edison the most of all. That in itself would make him congenial to me. I myself think of Edison side by side with Christopher Columbus, and I guess the high chair he sets on up in my mind, with his lap full of his marvellous discoveries, is a little higher than Columbuses high chair.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304130">Oh, how congenial the Ragah of Kahurthalia would be! How I wish we could have visited together! But it wuzn't to be, for Josiah said that he'd gone the night before, so we wended on.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304131" n="583 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304132">Wall, we hadn't more than got into the grounds this mornin' when Josiah hearn a bystander a-stand-in' near tell another one about the Ferris Wheel.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304133">"Why," sez he, "you jest git into one of them cars, and you are carried up so that it seems as if you can see the hull world at your feet."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304134">Josiah turned right round in his tracts, and sez he, "Where can I find that wheel?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304135">And the man sez, "On the Midway Plaisance."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304136">And Josiah sez, "Where is that?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304137">And the man pinted out the nearest way, and nothin' to do but what we must set out to find that wheel, and go up in one.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304138">I counselled caution and delay, but to no effect. That wheel had got to be found to once, and both on us took up in it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304139">I dreaded the job.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304140">Wall, the Plaisance begins not fur back of the Woman's Buildin'. It is a strip of land about six hundred feet wide and a mild in length, connecting Washington Park with Jackson Park, where Columbus has his doin's, and it comes out at the Fair Ground right behind the Woman's Buildin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304141">Josiah jest wanted to rush along, clamorin' for the wheel, and not lookin' for nothin' on either side till he found it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304143">But I wuz firm in this as a rock, that if I went at <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304142" n="584 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>all I would go megum actin' and quiet, and look at everything we come to.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304144">And wuzn't there enough to look at jest in the street? Folks of all nations under the earth. They seemed like the leaves of a forest, or the sands of the sea, if them sands and leaves wuz turned into men, wimmen, and children—high hats, hunnets, umbrells, fans, canes, parasols, turbans, long robes, and short ones, gay ones, bright ones, feathers, sedan chairs, bijous, rollin' chairs, Shacks—or that is how Josiah pronounced it. I told him that they wuz spelt S-h-e-i-k-s.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304145">But he sez that you could tell that they wuz Shacks by the looks on 'em.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304146">Truly it wuz a sight—a sight what we see in that street. Why, it wuz like payin' out some thousand dollars, and with two trunks, and onmeasured fatigue, spend years and years travellin' over the world.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304147">Why, we seemed to be a-journeyin' through foreign countries, a-carryin' the thought with us that we took our breakfast in our own hum, and that we should sleep there that night, but for all that we wuz in Turkey, and Japan, and Dahomey, and Lapland, etc., etc., etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304149">Wall, the first thing we come to as we begun on the right side—and anybody with my solid principles <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304148" n="585 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>wouldn't begin on any other side but the sheep's side—we wouldn't begin on the goats—no, indeed!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304150">The first thing we come to wuz the Match Company. Here you could see everything about makin' matches, and when you consider how hard it would be to go back to the old way of strikin' light with a flint, and traipsin' off to the neighbors to borrow a few coals on a January mornin', you will know how interestin' that exhibit wuz.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304151">And then come the International Dress and Costume Company—all the different countries of the globe show their home life and costumes.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304152">And I sez to Josiah, "If this Fair had been put off ten years, or even five, I believe the American wimmen would show a costume less adapted to squeezin' the life out of 'em, and scrapin' up all the filth and disease in the streets, and rakin' it hum."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304153">And Josiah sez, "Oh, do come along! we shan't git to that wheel to-day if you dally so, and begin to talk about wimmen and their doin's."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304155">Then come the Workin' Man's Home in Philadelphia. Then the Libby Glass Works, and when Josiah discovered it wuz free, he willin'ly accedded to my request to walk in and look round. He told me from the first on't that he wuzn't goin' to pay out a cent of money there. Sez he, "We can see enough <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304154" n="586 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>—Heaven knows we can—without payin' for any sights."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304156">Wall, here we see all kinds of American glass manufactured, from goblets and butter-dishes up to glass draperies, dresses, laces, neck-ties, and all sorts of orniments.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304157">Josiah sez, "Samantha, oh, how I would like a glass necktie—it would be so uneek; how I could show off to Deacon Gowdy!"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304158">"Wall," sez I, "we can try to buy one, and at the same time I will order a glass polenay."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304159">"Oh, no," sez he, "It would be too resky; glass is so brittle it would make you restive."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304160">And he tried to hurry me along, but I would look round a little; and we see there right before our face and eyes a man take a long tube and dip it into melted glass, and blow out cubs and flower-vases, and trim 'em all off with flowers of glass of all colors, and sech cut glass as we see there I never see before; why, one little piece takes a man a month to cut it out into its diamond glitter.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304161">And I would stop to see that glass dress all finished off for the Princess Eulaly.

wove into twelve yards of cloth, and sent to a dress-maker in New York, who fitted it to the Princess on her last days in the city. It is low neck and short sleeves, and has a row of glass fringe round the bottom, and soft glass ruching round the neck and sleeves. It looks some like pure white satin, and some different. It is as beautiful as any dress ever could be, and Eulaly will look real sweet in it. She'll be sorry to not have me see her in it, I hain't a doubt.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304166">And oh, how I did wish, as I looked at it, that her ancestor could have seen it, and meditated how pert and forwards the land wuz that he'd discovered!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304167">Glass dresses—the idee!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304168">But Josiah looked kinder oneasy all the time that I wuz a-lookin' at it; he wuz afraid of what thoughts I might be entertainin' in my mind onbeknown to him, and he hurried me onwards.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304169">But the very next place we come to he wuz still more anxious to proceed rapidly, for this wuz the Irish Village, where native wimmen make the famous Irish laces.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304170">It wuz a perfect Irish village, lackin' the dirt, and broken winders, and the neighborly pigs, and etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304172">At one end of it is the exact reproduction of the ancient castle Donegal, famed in song and story. In the rooms of this castle the lace wuz exhibited—<pb n="589 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="589" facs="mhworld589"/>beautiful laces as I ever see, or want to see, and piles and piles of it, and of every beautiful pattern.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304173">I did hanker for some of it to trim a night-cap. As I told Josiah, "I wouldn't give a cent for any of the white lace dresses, not if I had to wear 'em, or white lace cloaks." Sez I, "I'd feel like a fool a-goin' to meetin' or to the store to carry off butter with a white lace dress on, or a white lace mantilly, but I would love dearly to own some of that narrer lace for a night-cap border."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304174">But his anxiety wuz extreme to go on that very instant.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304176">He wanted to see the Blarney stun on top of the tower of the castle. It is a stun about as big as Josiah's hat, let down below the floor, so's you <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304175" n="590 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>have to stoop way down to even see it, let alone kissin' it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304177">Josiah wuz very anxious to kiss it, but I frowned on the needless expense.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304178">Sez I, "Men don't <hi rend="italic">need</hi>to kiss it; Blarney is born in 'em, as you may say, and is nateral nater to 'em."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304179">Sez he "But it is so stylish to embrace it, Samantha, and it only costs ten cents."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304180">"But," I sez firmly, "you hain't a-goin' to kiss no chunk of Chicago stun, Josiah Allen, or pay out your money for demeanin' yourself."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304181">Sez I, "The original Blarney stun is right there in its place in the tower of Blarney Castle in Ireland. It hain't been touched, and couldn't be."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304182">"I don't believe that Lady Aberdeen would allow no sech works to go on," sez he.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304183">Sez I, "Lady Aberdeen can't help herself. How can a minister keep the hull of his congregation from lyin'?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304184">Sez I, "She is one of the nicest wimmen in the world—one of the few noble ones that reach down from high places, and lift up the lowly, and help the world. I don't spoze she knows about the Blarney stun. And don't you go to tellin' her," sez I severely, "and hurt her feelin's."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304186">Sez he, in a morbid tone, "We hain't been in the <pb n="591 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="591" facs="mhworld591"/>habit of visitin' back and forth, and probable if we wuz, you'd tell her before I could if you got a chance.

Why, <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304203" n="594 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>sometimes one hull side of their housen would be made of a mat of braided bamboo. Bamboo is used by them for food, shelter, war implements, medicine, musical instruments, and everything else. Their housen wuz made in Japan, and brung over here and set up by native workmen. They have thatched ruffs and kinder open-work sides, dretful curious-lookin', and on the wide porticos of these housen little native wimmen set and embroider, and wind skeins of gay-colored cotton, and play with their little brown black-eyed babies.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304205">The costumes of the Japanese look dretful curious to us; their loose gay-colored robes and turbans, and sandals, etc., look jest as strange as Josiah's pantaloons and hat, and my bask waist duz to them, I spoze.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304206">They're a pleasant little brown people, always polite—that is learnt 'em as regular as any other lesson. Then there is another thing that our civilized race could learn of the heathen ones.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304207">Missionaries that we send out to teach the heathen let their own children sass 'em and run over 'em. That is the reason that they act so sassy when they're growed up. Politeness ort to be learnt young, even if it has to be stomped in with spanks.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304209">The Japanese are it child-like people easily <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304208" n="595 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>pleased, easily grieved—laughin' and cryin' jest like children.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304210">They work all day, not fast enough to hurt 'em, and at nightfall they go out and play all sorts of native games.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304211">That's a good idee. I wish that Jonesvillians would foller it. You'd much better be shootin' arrers from blowpipes than to blow round and jaw your household. And you'd much better be runnin' a foot race than runnin' your neighbors.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304212">They've got a theatre where they perform their native dances and plays, and one man sets behind a curtain and duz all the conversation for all the actors. I spoze he changes his voice some for the different folks.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304213">Wall, I led Josiah off towards the church, where all the articles of furniture is a big bamboo chair, where the priest sets and meditates when he thinks his people needs his thought.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304214">I d'no but it helps 'em some, if he thinks hard enough—thoughts are dretful curious things, anyway.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304215">Josiah and I took considerable comfort a-wanderin' round and seein' all we could, and noticin' how kind o' turned round things wuz from Jonesville idees.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304217">Now, they had some queer-lookin' little store-<pb xml:id="mhworld_1304216" n="596 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>housen, and for all the world they opened at the top instead of the sides, to keep the snakes out of the rice in their native land, so they said.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304218">Josiah wuz jest crazy to have one made like it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304219">"Why," sez he, "think of the safety on't, Samantha! Who'd ever think of goin' into a corn house on top if they wanted to steal some corn?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304220">But I sez, "Foreign customs have got to be adopted with megumness, Josiah Allen." Sez I, "With your rumatiz, how would you climb up on't a dozen times a day?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304221">He hadn't thought of that, and he gin up the idee.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304222">Then the ideal figger of the Japanese wimmen is narrer shoulders and big waist.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304223">And though I hailed the big waist joyfully, I drawed the line at the narrer shoulders.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304224">They, have long poles about their housen, with holes bored in 'em, through which the wind blows with a mournful sort of a voice, and they think that that noise skairs away evil sperits.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304225">When they come here each of their little verandas had a cage with a sacred bird in it to coax the good sperits; they all died off, and now they've got some pigens for 'em, and made 'em think that they wuz sacred birds.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304227">And Josiah, as he see 'em, instinctively sez, " Dum <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304226" n="597 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>'em, I'd ruther have the evil sperits themselves round than them pigens, any" time."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304228">He hates 'em, and I spoze they do pull up seeds considerable.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304229">Them Japanese wimmen are dretful cheerful-lookin', and Josiah and I talked about it considerable.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304230">Sez Josiah, "It's queer when, accordin' to their belief, a man's horse can go to Heaven, but their wives can't; but the minute they leave this world another celestial wife meets him, and he and his earth wife parts forever.It is queer," sez he, "how under them circumstances that the wimmen can loot so happy."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304231">And I sez, "It can't be that they hail anhialation as a welcome rest from married life, call it?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304232">Josiah acted mad, and sez he, "I'd be a fool if I wuz in your place!"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304233">And bein' kinder mad, he snapped out, "Them wimmen don't loot as if they knew much more than monkeys; compared to American wimmen, it's a sight.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304234">But I sez, "You can't always tell by looks, Josiah Allen." Sez I, "As small as they be, they've showed some of the greatest qualities since they've been here—Constancy, Fidelity, Love."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304236">Now one of them females lost a baby while she <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304235" n="598 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>wuz here. Did she act as some of our fashionable American wimmen do? No. They own twenty Saritoga trunks, and wear their entire contents, but they do, as is well known, commit crime to evade the cares of motherhood.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304237">But this little woman right here in Chicago, she jest laid down broken-hearted and died because her baby died. Her true heart broke.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304238">Little and humbly, no doubt, and not many clothes on, but from a upper view I wonder if her soul don't look better than the civilized, fashionably dressed murderess?</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304239">There wuz theatres here with dancin' girls goin' as fur ahead, they said, of Louie Fuller and Carmen-citi as them two go ahead of Josiah and Deacon Sypher as skirt-dancers.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304240">I guess that Josiah Allen would have gone in, regardless of price, to see this sight, so onbecomin' to a deacon and a grandfather, but I broke it up at the first hint he gin.

Inside the village is a Country Fair, the German Concert Garden, a Water Tower and two Restaurants, Tyrolese dancers, Beer Hall, etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304249">In the centre is a 16th century castle, with moat round it, and palisades.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304250">Josiah wuz all took up with this, and said "how he would love to have a moat round our house." Sez he, "Jest let some folks that I know try to git in, wouldn't I jest hist up the drawbridge and drop'em outside?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304251">And I sez, "Heaven knows, Josiah, that sech a thing would be convenient ofttimes, but," sez I, "anxieties and annoyances have a way of swimmin moats, you can't keep 'em out."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304252">But he said "that he believed that he and Ury could dig a moat, and rig up a drawbridge." And to git his mind off on't I hurried him on.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304253">Inside the castle is a dretful warlike-lookin' group of iron men, all dressed up in full uniform, and there wuz all kinds of weepons and armor of Germany.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304254" n="601 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304255">The Town Hall of this village is a museum.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304256">In the village market-place is sold all kinds of German goods. Two bands of music pipe up, and everybody is a-talkin' German. It made it considerable lively to look at, but not so edifyin' to us as if we knew a word they said.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304257">And then come the Street of Cairo, a exact representation of one of the most picturesque streets in old Cairo, with queer-lookin' kinder square housen, and some of the winders stood open, through which we got lovely views of a inner court, with green shrubs, and flowers, and fountains.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304258">On both sides of this street are dance halls, mosques, and shops filled with manufactures from Arabia and the Soudan. In the Museum are many curious curiosities from Cairo and Alexandria.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304259">And the street is filled with dogs, and donkeys, and children and fortune-tellers, and dromedaries, and sedan chairs, with their bearers, and camels, and birds, and wimmen with long veils on coverin' most of their faces, jest their eyes a-peerin' out as if they would love to git acquainted with the strange Eastern world, where wimmen walk with faces uncovered, and swung out into effort and achievement.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304261">I guess they wuz real good-lookin'. I know that the men with their turbans and long robes looked quite well, though odd. In the shops wuz the most <pb n="602 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="602" facs="mhworld602"/>beautiful jewelry and precious stuns, and queer-lookin' but magnificent silk goods, and cotton, and lamps, and leather goods, and weepons, etc., etc., etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304262">Wall, right there, as we wuz a-wanderin' through that street, from the handsomest of the residences streamed forth a bridal procession. The bride wuz dressed in gorgeous array of the beautiful fabrics of the East.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304263">And the bridegroom, with a train of haughty-lookin' Arabs follerin' him, all swept down the streets towards the Mosque, with music a-soundin' out, and flowers a-bein' throwed at 'em, and boys a-yellin', and dogs a-barkin', etc., etc.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304264">I drew my pardner out of the way, for he stood open-mouthed with admiration a-starin' at the bride, and almost rooted to the spot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304265">But I drawed him back, and sez I, "If you've got to be killed here, Josiah Allen, I don't want you killed by a Arab."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304266">And he sez, "I d'no but I'd jest as lieves be killed by a Arab as a Turkey.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304268">"But," sez he, "you tend to yourself, and I'll <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304267" n="603 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>tend to myself.

I hate daggers, and abominate snakes, and always did.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304272">And then I knew what a case Josiah Allen is to imitate and foller new-fangled idees, and I didn't want my new glass butter dish and cream pitcher to fall a victim to his experiments.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304273">Wall, next come Algeria and Tunis, and then Tunicks showed jest how they lived and moved in their own Barbery's state.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304274" n="604 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304275">Their housen are beautiful, truly Oriental—white, with decorations of pale green, blue, and vermilion.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304276">One is a theatre that will hold 600 folks.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304277">Then comes the panorama of the big volcano Kilauana.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304278">They couldn't bring the volcano with 'em, as volcanoes can't be histed round and lifted up on camels, or packed with sawdust, specially when they're twenty-seven milds acrost.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304279">So they brung this great picter of it. I spoze it is a sight to see it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304280">But Josiah felt that he couldn't afford to go in and see the sight, and he sez, "It is only a hole with some fire and ashes comin' out of the top of it."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304281">I sez ironically, "Some like our leech barrel, hain't it, with a few cinders on top?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304282">"Why, yes; sunthin' like that," sez he. "It wouldn't pay to throw away money on ashes and fire that we can see any day to hum."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304283">I didn't argue with him, for I never took to volcanoes much—I never loved to git intimate with 'em. But it wuz a sight to behold, so Miss Plank said—she went in to see it. She said, "It took her breath away the sight on't, but she's got it back agin (the breath); she talked real diffuse about it. But to resoom.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304284" n="605 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304285">The Chinese Village wuz jest like goin' through China or bein' dropped down onbeknown to you into a China village.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304286">Two hundred Chinamen are here by a special dispensation of Uncle Sam.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304287">And next to China is the Captive Balloon. I had wondered a sight what that meant.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304288">Josiah thought that somebody had catched a young balloon, and wuz bringin' it up by hand, but I knew better than that. I knew that balloons didn't grow indigenious.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304289">And it wuz jest as I'd mistrusted—they had a big balloon here all tied up ready to start off at a minute's notice.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304290">You jest paid your money, and you could go on a trip up in it through the blue fields of air. I told Josiah "that it wouldn't be but a few years before folks would ride round in 'em jest as common as they do in wagons." Sez I, "Mebby we shall have a couple of our own stanchled up in our own barn."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304291">"You mean tied up," sez he, and I do spoze I did mean that.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304292">But now to look up at the great deep overhead, and consider the vastness of space, and consider the smallness of the ropes a-holdin' the balloon down, I said to myself, "Mebby it wuz jest as well not to tackle the job of ridin' out in it that day."</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304293" n="606 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304294">Jest as I wuz a-meditatin' this Josiah spoke up, and sez, "I won't pay out no two dollars apiece to ride in it."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304295">And I sez, "I kinder want to go up in it, and I kinder don't want to."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304296">And he sez, "That is jest like wimmen—whifflin', onstabled, weak-livered."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304297">Sez I, "I believe you're afraid to go up in it."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304298">"Afraid!" sez he; "I wouldn't be afraid a mite if it broke loose and sailed off free into space."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304299">"Why don't you try it, then?" I urged. "Wall," he sez, a-lookin' round as if mebby he could find some excuse a-layin' round on the ground, or sailin' round in the air, "if I wuz," sez he—"if I had another vest on. I hain't dressed up exactly as I'd want to be to go a-balloon ridin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304300">"And then," sez he, a-brightenin' up, "I don't want to skair you. You'd most probable be skairt into a fit if it should break loose and start off independent into space. And it would take away all my enjoyment of such a pleasure excursion to see you a-layin' on the earth in a fit."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304301">Sez I, "It hain't vests or affection that holds you back, Josiah Allen—it's fear."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304303">"Fear!" sez he; "I don't know the meanin' of that word only from what I've read about it in the dictionary. Men don't know what it is to be afraid, <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304302" n="607 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>and that is why," sez he, "that I've always been so anxious to have wimmen keep in her own spear, where men could watch over her, humble, domestic, grateful.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304304">"Nater plotted it so," sez he; "nater designs the male of creation to branch out, to venter, to labor, to dare, while the female stays to hum and tends to her children and the housework."

But they can't knock it over," sez he—"the female foot hain't strong enough."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304306">He wuz a-goin' on in this remarkably eloquent way on his congenial theme, but I kinder drawed him in by remindin' him of Miss Sheldon's tent we see in the Transportation Buildin'—the one she used in her lonely journeyin' a-explorin' the Dark Continent.

But I didn't let Josiah look on any dancin' or anything of the kind that I could help.

I had stood lots of his experimentin' and branchin's out into new idees, but I felt that I could not brook this, so I would not heed his desire to stop. I made him move onwards.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304395">And then come Austria.

It stands up aginst the sky like a huge spider-web. It is two hundred and fifty feet in diameter—jest one wheel; think of that! As wide as twenty full-sized city houses—the idee! And there are thirty-six cars hitched to it, and sixty persons can ride in each car. So you can figger it out jest how much that huge spider-web catches when it gits in motion. Wall, my feelin's when I wuz a-bein' histed up through the air wuz about half and half—half sublimity and orr as I looked out on the hull glory of the world <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304408" n="621 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>spread at my feet, and Lake Michigan, and everything—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304410">That part wuz clear riz up and noble, and then the other half wuz a skittish feelin' and a-wonderin' whether the tacklin' would give way, and we should descend with a smash.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304411">But the fifty-nine other people in the car with me didn't seem to be afraid, and I thought of the thirty-five other cars, all full, and a-swingin' up in the air with me; and the thought revived me some, and I managed to maintain my dignity and composure.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304412">Josiah acted real highlarious, and he wanted to swing round time and agin; he said "he would give a cent to keep a-goin' all day long."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304413">But I frowned on the idee, and I hurried him off by the model of the Eiffel Tower into Persia.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304414">There it wuz agin, my pardner and I a-travellin' in Persia—the very same Persia that our old Olney's gography had told us about years and years ago—a-visitin' it our own selves.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304415">I see the bazaars and booths all filled with the costliest laces, and rugs, and embroideries, and the Persians themselves a-sellin' 'em.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304416">But Josiah hurried me along at a fearful rate, for I had got my eye onto some lace that I wanted.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304417" n="622 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304418">I did not want to be extravagant, but I did want some of that lace; I thought how it would set off that night-cap.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304419">But he said "that Jonesville lace wuz good enough if I had got to have any; but," sez he, "I don't wear lace on my night-cap."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304420">"No," sez I; "how lace would look on a red woollen night-cap!"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304421">"Wall," sez he, "why don't you wear red woollen ones?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304422">Sez I, "Josiah, you're not a woman."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304423">"No," sez he; "you wouldn't catch a man goin' to Persia for trimmin' for a night-cap."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304424">His axents jarred onto me, and mechanically I follered him into the Moorish Palace.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304425">One reason why I follered him so meekly and willin'ly, I didn't know but he would broach the subject of seein' them Persian wimmen dance.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304426">And I felt that I would ruther give a hull churnin' of fall's butter than to have his moral old mind contaminated with the sight.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304427">For they do say, them who have seen the sight, that "them Persian dancin' girls carry dancin' clear to the very verge of ondecency, and drop way off over the verge.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304428">I see lots of wimmen comin' out with their fan held before their blushin' faces.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304429" n="623 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304430">They say that wimmen fairly enjoy a-goin' in there to be horrified.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304431">They go day after day, they say, so to come out all horrified up, and their faces bathed in blushes.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304432">The men didn't come out at all, so they said.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304433">Wall, Josiah Allen didn't git in—no, indeed.

That filled me with large emotions, and Selinda felt it too.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304476">And it wuz here that Josiah nudged me, and sez he, "You've always throwed it into my face that men <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304475" n="629 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>don't think so much of each other as wimmen do; and now," sez he, "look at them two men—I've watched 'em as long as ten minutes—a-holdin' each other's hands."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304477">And sure enough, I turned, and I see two good-lookin' men a-holdin' each other by the hand as if they loved each other fondly—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304478">As if they couldn't bear to leggo. They wuz first-rate lookin' men, too, and you could see plain by their liniments how much store they sot by each other.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304479">Wall, Josiah and I wended off and looked at the wax figgers of Lincoln, and the death of Marie Antoinette, and lots of other interestin' wax statutes; and when we come back, there stood them two men still a-holdin' each other by the hand; and Josiah whispered agin, "How they love each other! no gabblin' and gushin', like wimmen, but jest silent, clost, deep love."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304480">"But," I sez, "I believe there is sunthin' wrong about 'em. It hain't nateral for men to stand still so long holt of hands. I believe they're in a fit or sunthin'."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304481">"A fit!" sez he. "I spoze a woman would have a fit if she had to keep still a minute with another woman in gunshot of her.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304482">"But to satisfy you," sez he, "I'll see."</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304483" n="630 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304484">So he accosted 'em, and sez he, "I will ask the way to Noah's Ark." So he advanced with a polite air, and sez he, "Could either one of you two gentlemen tell me where Noah's Ark is situated?" Sez he, "Bizer is anxious to see it."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304485">They didn't move or stir, and Josiah agin sez, "Do you know where Noah's Ark is?" and he laid his hand on the arm of one of the men who stood near him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304486">A Columbian Guard who stood near sez, "Keep your hand offen the wax figger!"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304487">Josiah wuz mortified most to death. He'd wanted to show off the equality of his sect, and to have man's love and fidelity proved to be but wax wuz harrowin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304488">But he didn't stay mortified more'n a minute and a half on sech a business.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304489">And the Guard told us where Noah's Ark wuz.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304490">And Bizer and Josiah wuz all carried away with it. This wuz in the children's room, and all the animals are reproduced life size, every one of 'em two and two, jest as they enter the Ark.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304491">We couldn't hardly tear our two pardners away, Selinda and I couldn't.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304492">Josiah said, "It wuz so beautiful and interestin'," and so Bizer said.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304494">But I believe what made them men cling to it so <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304493" n="631 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>for sech a length of time, they hearn us talk about how we wanted to go into the Bazaar, where there wuz lots of things to sell.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304495">But finally they see they couldn't hold us back no longer, so we went through that gorgeous place, all full of bronzes, rugs, vases, pipes, and etcetry.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304496">We didn't stay long here, though, for Bizer and Josiah said that the air wuz that bad they wuz chokin', and that they couldn't stan' it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304497">And Selinda and I a-feelin' that chokin' a pardner wuz the last thing we wanted to undertake, we went through it at a pretty good jog, and anon we found ourselves in Turkey; and here I found the Turkeys had done first-rate.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304498">Why, one piece of their hand-wrought lace wuz worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. While I wuz a-admirin' of it, Josiah whispered firmly—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304499">"Don't go to thinkin' of that old night-cap in sech a time as this."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304500">And I whispered back, "I hain't no more idee on't than you have of buyin' that old tent to take down to the lake with you a-fishin'."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304501">That very old battle-tent wuz all hand work, embroidered in gold and silver and silk in nateral figgers, and they said it wuz worth five millions of dollars—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304503">And a silver bedstead the Sultan is a-goin' to give <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304502" n="632 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>to his daughter as a part of her settin' out when she marries wuz worth four hundred and fifty thousand dollars.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304504">You can from this form some idee of the value of the other enormous exhibits.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304505">And the most beautiful horses you ever see, right from the Sultan's stable, wuz a-prancin' round. And one hundred Beoudins with camels and dromedaries added to the picteresqueness of the seen.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304506">And then we see Cleopatri's needle, that tall column a-risin' up to the sky, all covered with writ-in' worse than mine, and that's a-sayin' a good deal. I couldn't read a word on't, nor Josiah couldn't.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304507">And to the back of the Grand Bazaar wuz leven cottages, where male and female Turkeys wuz workin' at their different trades, showin' jest how rugs, and carpets, and embroideries, and brass work is made.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304508">As I said to Selinda, "Would you believed it possible, Selinda, if we'd been told on't a dozen years ago that you and I should be a-travellin' in Turkey to-day?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304509">And she said, "No, indeed; she had never imagined that she should ever visit sech foreign shores."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304510">Yes, we felt considerable riz up to think that we wuz engaged in foreign travel, but not hauty. No, we are both on us well-principled, and don't believe in puttin' on airs.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304511" n="633 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304512">Wall, we stayed here a good while, and Josiah thought he'd eat sunthin' here, too. If he'd had his way, he would had a good square meal in every foreign country, and native one, too. That man's appetite is wonderful. Foreign countries can't quell it down, nor rumatiz, nor nothin'.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304513">Hakenbeck's animal show comes next, and it is the most complete—so they say—that wuz ever exhibited.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304514">The tent is two hundred feet square, and is filled with all the animals that ever went into the Ark, and more, too, I believe. Five thousand people can go in here at one time, and set down, and see lions a-ridin' on horseback, with a woman to run the performance, and see animals a-doin' everything else that ever wuz done by 'em, and tigers, and elephants, and performin' horses, and two hundred monkeys, and one thousand parrots.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304515">We didn't go in, but Josiah slipped in one day when I wuzn't with him, and he described it to me. He owned up to me that he had.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304516">And he said he did it to keep me from havin' sech a skair."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304517">"Why," sez he, "a woman that is afraid of a gobbler, and runs from a snake—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304519">"Why," sez he, "I wouldn't as a man of feelin' take her right in the way of havin' her feelin's hurt <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304518" n="634 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>and skairin' her most to death for nothin' this world could give."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304520">And I said—and I meant it—"If it hadn't been for the fifty cents I guess you wouldn't felt so, Josiah Allen."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304521">But he stuck to it that it wuz pure affection and principle. I d'no what to think about it, but I have my suspicions.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304522">Wall, at the next place Josiah could not be restrained. It wuz the good old-fashioned New England house with gable ends, and here a good New England dinner wuz served.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304523">And sez Josiah, "I don't leave this house till I have a good square meal."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304524">Bizer felt jest so, and so Selinda and I jined 'em in a meal most as good as she and I got up to hum, and that is sayin' a great deal.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304525">Josiah's satisfaction in eatin' that pork and beans, and them doughnuts, wuz a sight to witness.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304526">Bizer called for cold biled vittles, and sure enough, they brung 'em on.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304527">And the enjoyment of them two men wuz extreme. Selinda and I took comfort in some old-fashioned pound-cake and custard pie.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304528">Selinda said she'd love to have the receipt of that pound-cake.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304529" n="635 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304530">Selinda is a good plain cook. She can't cook like me, of course, but she duz well.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304531">Wall, their extra good meal had sot up Josiah and Bizer to a wonderful extent (they had drunk coffee too strong for 'em by half, and I knew it), and them two men wanted to go back into the Cairo Street. Bizer and Selinda had never seen it, and all the way there Josiah seemed to be on the lookout to do sunthin' heroic and surprisin' to Bizer.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304532">And jest after we got there, we did see as strange a sight as I ever see. It wuz a Eastern Fakir, as they called him. He wuz performin' one of his strange sights right there before our face and eyes.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304533">A big crowd wuz gathered round him of human bein's in all strange costumes, and camels and their drivers, and dromedaries, and donkeys, and everything else under the sun. But this man stood calm under the sights and ear-piercin' yells and jabbers.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304534">And in some way, I d'no how, nor Josiah don't, he wuz a-holdin' another Japan or Turkey—anyway, one of them foreign men—suspended right up in the air.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304535">I see it, and Josiah see it, and Bizerses folks. Eight eyes from Jonesville looked at it, to say nothin' of the assembled crowd.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304537">He wuzn't restin' on nothin' at all, so fur as we <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304536" n="636 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>could see. What material wrought out of the Occult World wuz piled up under him I d'no.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304538">There might have been a sofa and two cushions wrought out of another fabric different from what we know anything about, and that don't make any show aginst the summer sky.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304539">And then, agin, it might be that Josiah wuz right.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304540">He sez, "It's easy enough to do that. He casts a mist before our eyes, and we have to see jest what he wanted us to."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304541">"Wall," sez I, "if I had to do one of 'em to entertain the Missionary Society at Jonesville, I d'no but I had jest as soon hist Submit Tewksbury up in the air, and suspend her there in our parlor, as to cast mists before the eyes of the Jonesvillians and make 'em see her there when she wuz a-settin' on the sofa. Either one on 'em is queer—queer as a dog."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304542">"Wall," sez he, "you don't want to go into any sech a job. You'll kill Submit, anyway, experimentin' on her."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304543">And I sez, "You needn't worry; I hain't a-goin' to try to branch out into no sech doin's." Sez I, "I wuz usin' Submit as a metafor."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304544">Wall, the Fakir after a while asked the queer-lookin' crowd gathered round him for money to try more experiments with.</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304545" n="637 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304546">And wantin' to branch out and outdo Bizer, and make himself a hero, Josiah planked out a five-dollar bill.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304547">And then the man asked Josiah to look in his hat, and there inside the band he found the money, or so it seemed.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304548">And then he told me to look in my pocket, and there wuz five silver dollars to all appearance.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304549">I felt real well about it, and wuz about to put 'em into my portmoney, thinkin' that they wuz my lawful prey, seein' they had fell onto me through my pardner's weakness, when lo and behold! they wuzn't there.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304550">I felt real stunted, and kinder sot back.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304551">"Slight of hand," sez Josiah to me and Bizer.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304552">"Don't be afraid, I'll make it all right." And he reached out his hand to git the money back. The man handed the money back, or so we spozed, and vanished in the crowd.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304553">And Josiah, when he went to look in his hand, found some pink and white paper. He hollered round and acted for quite a spell, but the man wuz gone for good, and Josiah's money with him. Wall, Josiah wuz almost broken-hearted over the loss of his money; he felt awful browbeat and smut, and acted so.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304555">And then it wuz Bizer's time to show off and act. <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304554" n="638 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>Nothin' to do but what Selinda had got to ride a camel.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304556">She hung back and acted 'fraid. She hain't a bit well, for all she is so fat. She has real dizzy spells sometimes, and is that cowardly that she'd be 'fraid to ride a cow, let alone one of them tall, humbly monsters. But nothin' to do but what Bizer would have his way.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304557">He did it jest to go ahead of us, and I knew it, for I put my foot right down in the first on't.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304558">Josiah would a paid out the money willin'ly ruther than had Bizer go ahead of him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304559">Bizer said he wanted to give Selinda all the enjoyment he could while on her tower, she had been shet up so much, and hadn't had the pleasures she ort to had.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304560">I knew his motives and Selinda's feelin's, but couldn't break it up, for Selinda had always follered Elder Minkley's orders strict, that he gin her at the altar—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304561">"Wives, obey your husbands."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304562">She didn't rebel outward, but she whispered to me in pitiful axents—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304563">"I hate to ride that creeter—oh, how I hate to! But you know my principles," sez she; "you know I always said that wives ort to obey their pardners."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304565">And I sez, "When pardners and common sense <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304564" n="639 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>conflict, I foller common sense every time. Howsumever," sez I, "if you want to air them principles of yourn, you won't be apt to find a more lofty place to exhibit 'em."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304566">And I glanced up the gray precipitous sides of that camel, and she looked up 'em, too, with fear and tremblin', but begun to gird her lions, figgeratively speakin', to obey Bizer and embark.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304567">She has always boasted to me and the other neighborin' wimmen that she has never disobeyed her husband once; and I sez to her cheerfully, "Wall, I have, and expect to agin, if the Lord spares my life."</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304568">And so Miss Bobbet told her, and Miss Gowdy, and Miss Peedick, and all the rest. She acted so high-headed about it, that we said it some to take down her pride, and some on principle.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304569">We believed there wuz reason in all things, and none of us wimmen felt that we would stand
<q><l>"On a burnin' deck,</l><l>Whence all but we had fled,"</l></q>
and burn up, even if our pardners had ordered us to. We wuz law-abidin', every one on us, but we felt there wuz times where law ended and common sense begun.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304571">But Selinda argued, I well remember, that if <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304570" n="640 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>Bizer had ordered her to stay on that deck, she should stay and be sot fire to.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304572">And she praised up little Casey Bianky warmly, while we thought and said that Casey acted like a fool, and felt that Mr. Bianky would much ruther had him run and save himself than to burn up; anyway, old Miss Bianky would, and I believe his pa would.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304573">Men are good-hearted creeters the biggest heft of the time, but failable in judgment sometimes, jest like female wimmen.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304574">But Selinda wuz firm in her belief.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304575">And here this day in Chicago she gin one of the most remarkable proofs of it ever seen in this country.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304576">So while Selinda trembled like a popple leaf, and her false teeth rattled over her dry tongue (besides the camel, she wuz 'fraid as death of the Turkey that driv it, and he did look fierce), the camel knelt down, and the almost swoonin' Selinda was histed up onto his back by the proud and haughty Bizer, and the strange-lookin' Turkey.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304580">She had no more than got seated when the driver give a skairful yell, and the camel give a fearful lunge, and straightened up on its feet, and Selinda's bunnet fell back onto her neck, and lay there through the hull of the enterprise, and her gray hair floated

back onchecked, for she dassent let her hands go a minit, to fix it.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304581">It wuz a mournin' bunnet and veil, but black gittin' soiled so easy, she had put on a bright green alpaca dress she had, thinkin' that she wouldn't see nobody she knew; and she wore some old yeller mitts for the same reason, and some low, shabby-lookin' shoes, and some white stockin's.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304582">And her weight bein' two hundred and forty, she showed off vivid aginst the settin' sun.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304583">Selinda is a meek woman and obedient, but she cries easy. You have got to take good traits and bad ones in folks. She can't help it.

No; before she had been up there two minits she begun to cry.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304585">She always makes up pitiful faces when she weeps. It has been talked on a sight in Jonesville, some sayin' she might help it, and some contendin' that she couldn't; but she skairs children frequent.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304587">But now she dassent leggo a minit to git her handkerchief, so she rode along weepin' silently, and <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304586" n="643 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>a fearful sight for men or angels, but truly a cryin' monument of wifely devotion.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304588">As she moved off, I could see at the first strain her dress waist, bein' one of the short round ones with a belt, had bust asunder, leavin' a white waist of cotton flannel between 'em, which seemed to be a-growin' wider and wider all the time. (She wears cotton flannel for her health.)</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304589">As I see this, and not knowin' what would ensue and take place in her clothin', I cast onto the wind my own fears, and the shrinkin' timidity of my sect, and graspin' my umbrell in my hand, I run along by the side of the lofty quadreped, a-tryin' to reach up and fix her a little.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304590">But I could not; her position wuz too lofty, the mount wuz too precipitous on which she sot.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304591">She see me, but she didn't stop her cryin', and the faces she wuz a-makin' wuz pitiful in the extreme, and skairful to anybody that hadn't seen 'em so much as I had.

But, anyway, she wore it a-fastenin' the lace at her white throat.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304892">But I do know that the girls and I gin her some good linen napkins, and towels, and table-cloths, and the boys a handsome set of books.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304894">And I do know that the supper afterwards wuz, although well I know the impoliteness of my even hintin' at it—I do know, and I should lie if I said that I didn't know it, that that supper wuz a good one—as good a one, so fur as my knowledge goes, <pb n="688 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="688" facs="mhworld688"/>as wuz ever put on a table in the town of Lyme, or the village of Jonesville.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304895">And Josiah Allen, he eat too much—fur, fur too much. And I hunched him three times to that effect at the time, to no avail.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304896">And once I stepped on his toe—a dretful warnin' steppin'—and he asked me out loud and snappish (I hit a corn, I spoze, onbeknown to me)—and he asked me right out before 'em all, voyalent, "What I wuz a-steppin' on his toe for?"</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304897">And so, of course, that curbed me in, and I had to let him go on, and cut a full swath in the vittles. But it wuz some comfort for me to think that most likely he wouldn't be tempted by a weddin' supper agin—not for some time, anyway. For the Babe wuz but young yet, and we wuz gettin' along.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304898">Yes, that hull weddin' went off perfectly beautiful, and there wuzn't but one drawback to my happiness on that golden day that united them two happy lovers.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304899">Yes, onbeknown to me a feelin' of sadness come over me—sadness and regret.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304901">It wuzn't any worriment and concern about the fate of Isabelle and her husband <pb xml:id="mhworld_1304900" n="689 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>—no; True Love wuz a-goin' out with 'em on their weddin' tower, and I knew if he went ahead of 'em, and they wuz a-walkin' in the light of his torch, their way wuz a-goin' to he a radiant and a satisfyin' one, whether it led up hill or down or over the deep waters—yea, even over the swellin' of Jordan.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304902">No, it wuzn't that, nor anything relatin' to the children, or my dress, or anything—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304903">No, my dress—a new lilock gray alpaca—sot out noble round my form, and my new head-dress wuz foamin' lookin', but it didn't foam too much.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304904">No, it wuzn't that, nor anything about the neighbors—no; they looked some envious at our noble doin's, and walked by the house considerable, and the wimmen made clients, and borrowed more tea and sugar, durin' the preparations, than it seemed as if they could use in two years; but I pitied 'em, and forgive 'em—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304905">And it wuzn't anything about the children or Krit.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304906">For the children wuz happy in their happy and prosperous hums, and Krit, they say—I don't tell it for certain—but they say that he come back engaged to a sweet young girl of Chicago—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304907">Come back from the great New World of the World's Fair, as his illustrious namesake went home so long ago, in chains—</p><pb xml:id="mhworld_1304908" n="690 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304909">Only Krit's chains wuz wrought of linked love and blessedness instead of iron—so they say.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304910">I've seen her picter; but good land! how can I tell who or what it is? It is pretty as a doll, and Krit seems to think his eyes on it; but he's so full of fun, I can't git any straight story out of him.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304911">But Thomas Jefferson says she is a bonny fidy girl—a good one and a pretty one, and has got a father dretful well off; and he sez that she and Krit are engaged. So I spoze more'n like as not they be.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304912">And I also learnt, through a letter received that very day, that Mr. Bolster has led Miss Plank to the altar, or she has led him—it don't make much difference. Anyway, she has walked offen the Plank of widowhood, and settled down onto a Bolster for life.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304913">I wuz glad on't. She wanted a companion, and he loves to converse, Heaven knows; and he is sure of one thing—he's almost certain, or as certain as we can be of anything in this life, that he will have the best pancakes that hands can make or spoons stir up.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304914">I learnt also from her letter—Miss Bolster's, knee Plankses—that Nony Piddock wuz a-goin into the ministery. What a case for funerals he will be, and shockin' casualities! But he won't be good for much on a weddin' occasion.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304915">And speakin' of weddin's brings me back to my subject agin.</p><pb n="691 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR." pages="691" facs="mhworld691"/><p xml:id="mhworld_1304917">No, it wuzn't any of these things that cast that mournful shadder on my eyebrows, anon, and even oftener, when I wuz out by myself—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304918">And I spoze that I might as well tell what it wuz that I regretted and missed—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304919">It wuz Christopher Columbus! the Brave Admiral! good, noble creeter!</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304920">I felt, in view of all he had done for America and the world, it wuz too bad that he had to die without havin' the privilege of seein' Jonesville, and bein' with us that day, and seein' what we see, and hearin' what we heard, and eatin' what we eat—</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304921">It wuz his doin's, the hull on't wuz Christopher Columbuses doin's. For if he hadn't discovered America, why, he wouldn't had no World's Fair for him. And then it stands to reason that Josiah and I shouldn't have gone to it. And if we hadn't gone to Miss Plankses, Mr. Freeman and Isabelle wouldn't have met.</p><p xml:id="mhworld_1304923">Yes, I felt to lay the praise of it all to that bless-<pb xml:id="mhworld_1304922" n="692 SAMANTHA AT THE WORLD'S FAIR."/>ed old mariner—I felt that I hadn't done nothin' towards it to what he had.
