      of The American RevolutionLet us join the D. A. R.As they come from near and farAnd unite to honor all who did their part,For our country when 'twas new,Every patriot tried and trueNow we come to honor brave old Nancy Hart!CHORUSHonk!  honk!  honk!  The horns are blowing!Let us all be bright and gay,Cast aside all care and woe,As we onward swiftly go,While we glide along the Nancy Hart Highway!II.Passing swiftly o'er the trail,Never mind the Eastern gale,Sing a merry song of Jubilee today,Let Old Glory be unfurledWave its colors o'er the worldAs we glide along the Nancy Hart Highway!IIIMay kind heaven ever blessWith Great joy and all success,Every one who on this Highway swiftly speeds,Then, oh, let us ne'er forgetTill our evening sun has setNancy Hart and all her many glorious deeds!CHORUS
