      Yet sweeps the lingering mists away!By Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers, Poet Laureate,

      eracy at Statesboro, Georgia, On 

         October 27th, 1926.'Tis Morn, radiant Morn!  Upon each hillThere gleams a tint of gold, and in the vale afarIs heard the merry call of one who keepsEach wandering lamb from straying o'er the bar.The ploughman sings a cheer to new born dayAnd maids light-hearted roam o'er snowy fieldOr who at eve should bring the finest yield?Peace, lovely Peace, rests upon the Plantation Home!From teeming orchard to the garden gate,The sun-lit heights of Georgia's old red hillsBespeak the calm that dwells upon each State.King Cotton proudly smiles upon his royal seat,As autumn fruits their countless joys displayed;And golden grain breathes life and health complete,For Heaven's touch on every scene is laid!The Light of Holy Love beams o'er the peaceful hearth, forThere was no Bandit then!  No evil soul to roam,The Master, Mistress, and loved old Mammy knelt,To thank the Heavenly Father for their blessed Christian Home,Our own dear land!  Our hallowed Southern Home!Was there ever on Earth a land surpassing thee?Where friends dependant (not slaves) who with their lates breathDespite all war, could true and faithful be?And was there ever a Christmas Time so glad?With Banjo, Violin, Dance and Joy that filled The heart with happiness pure and unrestrained In knowing those whose wealth they help to build?But list!  Far down yon vale the thundering guns of warBreak up the placid flow of Atlantic wave,And wildly rush o'er loving peaceful homesTO cast their blooming roses in the grave! 'Tis Night!  Cheerless Night!  No star illumes the way.Our statesmen wise on terms of peace were sentBut not received.  Far different views prevailed -Against all Sovereign Rights coercion was intent!Then the Spirit of 1776 reawakened o'er the hillsAnd steel alike met steel with American valor anew,Till "The Stars and Bars" at Manassas brought forth a hopeful light,And proved to all, the bravery of King's Mountain still is

	true!Through strife was long avoided, yet our homes in ashes laidBrought in the mystic ruins words emblazed upon the airSoul cheering to the spirit with a light that cannot fade,This slogan of the Daughters - Live, Love, Think, Pray, Dare!The Holy Spirit guided, and compensation cameWhen Davis, Lee, and Stonewall add Righteousness to Fame,And with Heaven's light inspired still onward marched the GrayThough their number lessened daily mid the war clouds on the way.'Twas the Faith of our Fathers, which gave courage to the true,And it led by Holy Spirit all of our Southern Soldiers throughNot a hero of the Southland under General Lee's commandWould rob one of their property, or flash the fire brand!Then Hail, all Hail, with loving cheer, the memory tonightOf all who served their country in Justice and in Right,And may Daughters of Confederacy the gates of love unbarAnd lead the Blue and Gray as friends to Heaven's Crowning Star!
