      Poet Laureate, Georgia DivisionAurora gleamed in beauty o'er the hillsAnd cast a ray of golden charm that thrillsA soldier brave, who wandered neath the domeOf Mountain's sheltering arm and sun-lit home;Admiringly he gazed upon the view,And kneeling there where woodland flowers grew'He plead for Heavenly guidance on his way,For he must meet impending battle on that day!'Twas thus at Valley Forge that WashingtonInvoked the mighty "King of Kings," and won!For never a Warrior in other lands had broughtSo great a victory as he in Faith has wrought!Our vast Republic that extends from sea to sea,Whose banners wave in triumph o'er the Free;For Heaven has cast great blessings on our landOf Peace and Plenty by Divine command.Years pass - Then o'er the plains of MexicoNear by the gates of Alamo,The thundering sound of guns proclaimThat General Lane has won the fameOf "Marion," in his War time creed,And Zachary Taylor proved a help in needWhile Jefferson Davis in that Mexican War,Was at Buena Vista a reigning Star!A proof that undying Faith was thereAnd our bravest heroes lead by prayerNot one private home they effaceNor cruelly burn a record's placeThis Law kept General Lee for all the yearsFor oft he spared in Mercy a widow's tears,And to all nations his Orders were known,For his memory in reverence by the world is shown.Who can forget the brave Stonewall JacksonWhose Living Faith illumed each action?And Bishop Polk, near Kennesaw's great heightWho there was visually crowned by immortal Light?Years later on the same true faith abidesAs Pershing, the world-honored leader guides,While Victory crowns with success anew,And all nations honor his allegiance true!Then Hail!  All Hail!  With thankful voice acclaimThat Victory hath crowned "The Pure in Heart," with fameLet Earth and Heaven rejoice on land and sea afarWhen Faith and Love combined

	have won the brightest Star!
