FREEDOM.BY MARY ELIZA ROBBINS.Not until the question, What is a Man? Is satisfactorily answered, can the claims of each individual to entire freedom be firmly established.  Admitting the prevalent notions of man's nature, what is liberty that he should desire it?  But once believe man to be an incarnation of the divine Mind, the "Word made flesh," and liberty becomes at once a necessary element for the soul to be in.  It is the only conductor through which soul will consent to pass.  I cannot exist without it.  You might as well talk of animal life without atmosphere, as a man without perfect freedom.That man, or that woman, who, by life and by speech, contributes to this end, is a true Ab-

olitionist; since he, or she, adds another stubborn fact, in confirmation of the doctrine that man was created to be free.  When Man shall be understood, when he shall cease to be afraid of himself, the idea of supremacy among human beings will become as obsolete, as the notion of dividing this harmonious universe between a God and a Devil.  "A kingdom divided against itself cannot stand."
