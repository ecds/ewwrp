The Gallant

      Old Boys in GrayThey are marching today in their armor of gray,Where proudly in youth they so gallantly trod,E're Sherman invaded in battle arrayAnd swore each "Rebel should sleep in the sod."But the strife and such boasting are all cast aside,As they glance on their banner with joy and with prideStill beaming with Justice and Mercy and Right,For it waved o'er Lee in heaven's own light!No cause that is just and guarded with trustCan ever be lost to a patriot soul,Nor the rights of a state be  trampled in dustWhen honorable valor leads on to the goal.Then bravely look upward with conscience unstainedBy reckless disorder, or vice unrestrained,For you won that glory which never shall fadeIt's pure as thy banner, thy musket and blade.Four wars have displayed of what  metal they're made,Old Guilford, Monterey and Manassas proclaim,Then Spain with her heraldry, her pomp and her powerEclipsed as Hobson won honor and fame.This God-given spirit came down to the sonWhen Germans retreated and Victory won;Then cheer upon cheer for our Veterans in GrayWho honor both flags of America today!All hail to Atlanta! Queen city of light!Whose ministering love gives welcome and restTo all who battle for justice and right,From the north and the south, the east and west.Encamped on her soil, by thousands they cameAnd Gordon won chaplets and crosses of fame,Who are welcomed today with peans so gay,And deem it an honor to march with the Gray!LOULA KENDALL ROGERS.Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers, of Tennille, author of the above, was a "girl of the sixties" and is the widow of a splendid Confederate soldier, a captain in the Third Georgia regiment.
