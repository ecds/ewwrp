StaffSojourner TruthRevolution (July 20, 1871).Anecdotes of Sojourner Truth are numerous. The following relates to her experience in the Washington street-car:"She was an Empire State citizen and fully conscious of her rights "under de Constitution." She says: "When I went into de street to ride on de cars, de conductors would not look at me fust, an' all de drivers would turn heads anoder way: make believe dey didn't see me. But I fixed 'em." One day a car was coming along, and Sojourner felt anxious to ride. It was filled with people, and Sojourner planted herself firmly beside the track, and where the horses would be obliged to eat her up or stop. Along came the car. Sojourner gave the usual signal to stop, "but dat driver paid no 'tention to me, 'an was goin' right on when I gave such yelps! I tell yer yer oughter to hear me roar! I can yell when I try! I scared de horses and de people in de car. Dey was glad to stop, an' I hopped right in!" But the battle was only half over. Once in the car Sojourner had another foe to defeat in the conductor. But she proved equal to that emergency: "de conductor come along an' say, 'Go for'ard!' He said I must go for'ard wid de driver, but I sot down. He told me to 'git up!' I sot still. Den he told me to go for'ard ag'in or he would fro me out. Dat's jes' what I wanted him to do, 'cause yer see I felt as if I hadn't yelped quite enough. I had some more on 'em in, an' if he'd a tried it I'd raised his h'ar! I jes' told him to fro me out if he dar; dat I belonged to de Empire State, an' knew de laws. When I told him dat he went on collectin' his pennies, and carried me furder dan I wanted to go! I tell yer der's nothin' like standin' fer yer rights!"
