Honoring Our VeteransThe women of the South in their grief and desolation after the close of the great struggle for independence longed for a time when their patriotism might find free expression, and looked earnestly forward to a future when an opportunity should present itself for immortalizing the bravery of the Confederate soldier.Bowed down beneath the yoke of oppression during the period of reconstruction,

      wandering among the smoking embers of

      ruined homes, bereft of property, and weeping over the resting places

      of their loved ones, what could a bleeding heart look forward to?

      Like a wide desert waste the prospect was indeed a dreary one, and all they could do in their sorrow was to place the first sweet offerings of Spring upon the soldiers' grave.When the tide of prosperity once more swept over the broad spreading fields of our beautiful Southland, with it came glowing tributes in marble, as well as in song and story, to the beloved heroes who gave their lives to our country.  With united trust and hope, we have laid our plans before that Almighty Power

      

      which never fails to lend a helping hand in the hour of distress.  Then the bright hued rainbow of heavenly promise encircled the despairing heart and each passing year added a golden ray to its light with a cheering whisper that the South should rise again from the ashes.The time has come when true merit is

      recognized and our dearly honored fathers and brothers shall never

      more be branded in history as rebels and traitors.  With a love and devotion that knows

      no change, the Memorial Associations and Daughters of the Confederacy

      throughout the whole country have pressed forward until today there

      are thousands of, snowy monuments gleaming in the sunlight which will tell to future ages the gallant deeds of those who wore the gray, as well as those who wore the blue.This abiding interest in our cause had inspired the impoverished,

      broken-spirited veterans to look upward with rejoining that the time

      has come when their noble deeds were to be acknowledged and their

      glory perpetuated throughout the world.  That section of America which

      has brought forth a Lee, a Jefferson Davis, a Stonewall Jackson, and

      Albert Sidney Johnson and our own John B. Gordon, will never be

      blotted from the world.  And not only has it given these enduring

      names,

      

      but that of the first sweet daughter of the Confederacy our peerless Winnie Davis.Virginia has immortalized the virtues of this lovely olive branch

      of peace in a most exquisite piece creation of sculpture, but to Georgia credit

      is due for that living monument to her memory which is to scatter seed throughout all coming years.  On our own soil, and by the efforts of the Daughters of the Confederacy, is erected that fair type of colonial elegance, the Winnie Davis Memorial at Athens, for the education of the descendants of the Confederate veteran.  Even if no other work had been done the past year, this alone in all of its beauty and significance is a glory to Georgia."Glory Stands Beside Our Grief" is the motto of the Daughters of Maryland, and they have just unveiled one of the most beautiful Confederate monuments in the South, defying the world to produce anything superior in beauty and conception, design and execution.The Pennsylvania Chapter having been denied the privilege of

      erecting a monument to their soldiers in Philadelphia, "The City of brotherly love," had a shaft reared at Hollywood, determined that their dead heroes should be honored somewhere.Can we women ever forget?  No, as long as a Southern woman can speak, she will tell the old, old story of our loved ones on the battle field, of their chivalry, their knightly daring, and their loyalty.  Upholding the Stars and Bars in one hand, the sword in the other, they marched to the fray with a prayer on the lip, and the image of their sweetheart, mother and wife indelibly engraved on the faithful heart.The tocsin of war we hope will never more be heard in these United States, but when the truth of history is brought to light may all the world recognize the greatness of the southern soldier as it deserves.  May our glorious country, north, south, east and west become "one in thought, one in spirit, and one in all the elements that go to make a grand and glorious nation".Every year the ranks of our gallant soldiers are thinning out, but

      to show our reverence for those who remain we desire to present them

      with a cross of honor.  Would it were in our power to stud it with

      diamonds, encircle it with purest gold and entwine the Confederate

      flag about the cross, but this is only a symbol of our esteem and

      appreciation, and we hope will be cherished as a souvenir of

      regard."Then wear it!  although the causeIt represents has perished,Tis meet that in a crossIts memory should be cherished".All honor then to each and every soldier who fought for their country under their flag!Ah! neath its folds brave men moved onTill strength, and hope and life were gone!We meet then today to lay upon their resting places the first sweet offerings of spring, and like vestal virgins to kindle anew the light of patriotism and keep burning in the heart.And while we place garlands of roses over departed heroes, it is a pleasant task to honor our living soldiers with an emblem of esteem, to prove our appreciation of their faithfulness in the service of their country.  It is only a simple gift, but expresses much, a woman's remembrance of the times that tried men's souls, and of her own devotion to the brave and daring.Emblem of man's strong protectionWoman's faith and kind affectionLoyalty to home and sectionDuty nobly, bravely done.Cross of Honor, proudly bear it Faithfully, nobly, bravely wear itHeart's with trusted honor spare itFrom reproach and guilty stain.Memorial Addressby Mrs Loula Kendall Rogers April 26, 1904Honoring Our
