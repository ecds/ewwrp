What I Want My Husband To Be.1 I want my husband to be a manComplete in all that God may plan.2 He must be gallant he must be trueAnd coincide with all I do.3 He must not frown, he must not scoldAnd say my coffee is too coldThe steak is burnt, my rice not doneAnd think light bread must weigh a ton!4 Whatever I say whatever I doMy husband has got to say so too.5 Never a fault to find, not heWith either his mother-in-law or me.6 Tall and comely, black eyes and hairAnd the spirit to do and to dare.7 He must not talk about other pretty girlsOf rosy cheeks and golden curls,For if he does my time I'll waitAnd very soon retaliate8 My husband must be submissive to meAnd no other will but mine to be.9 If I wear a hat as big as the houseHe must be as meek as a mouse.And say I'm stunnin, tho he's frowninAnd that he thinks I'm sweeter that pinks.10 I want my mate to be something greatAn Earl a Count or a Potentate.11 My husband must be a PresidentOf something, though not worth a cent.12 He must have riches and plenty of goldAn automobile and a chauffeur bold.13 I'm satisfied with any old thingThat can give me a living and a diamond ring!
