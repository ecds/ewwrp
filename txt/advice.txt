Advice to the Women and Maidens of
London.Shewing, that instead of their usual Pastime;
and education in Needle-work, Lace, and Point-making, it were far more
Necessary and Profitable to apply themselves to the right
Understanding and Practice of the method of keeping books of account:
whereby, either single, or married, they may know their Estates, carry
on their Trades, and avoid the Danger of a helpless and forlorn
Condition, incident to Widows.With some Essays, or rudiments for young
beginners; in twelve Articles.By one of that SexLONDON

ADVICE To the WOMEN and MAIDENS OF LONDON.Ladies and Gentlewomen,Permit one of your sex to give you, as far as her small knowledge will reach some hints to the right understanding of Accounts: an Art so useful for all sorts, sexes and degrees of persons, especially for such as ever think to have to do in the world in any sort of Trade or Commerce, that next to a stock of Mony, Wares and Credit, this is the most necessary thing.Nor let us be discouraged, or put by the inspection thereof by
being bid meddle with our distaff, for I have heard it affirmed by
those who have lived in foreignforraign parts, that Merchants and other trades men have no other Book-keepers then their Wives: who by this means (the Husband dying) are well acquainted with the nature and manner of the trade, and are so certain how, and where their stock is; that they need not be beholden to servants or friends for guidance.And for telling us that the government of the House
apper
appertains to us, and the trades to our Fathers or Husbands; (under
favour) the one is to be minded, and the other not neglected, for
there is not that danger of a families overthrow by the saucesause wanting it's right relish, or the
Table or Stools misplac't, as by a widows ignorance of her concern as
to her estate, and I hope husbands will not oppose this when help and
care is intended to them whil'st living; and safety to their name and
posterity after death: except they have private trades (too much in
mode) whereof they would have their wives wholly ignorant. In such a
case indeed, one that knows not that one and two make three suits
best. And let us not fear we shall want time and opportunity to managemannage the decencies of our house; for what is an hour in a day, or half a day in a week, to make inspection into that, that is to keep me and mine from ruine and poverty.Methinks now the objection may be that this art is too high and
mysterious for the weaker sex it will make them
proud: Women hadWomenhad better keep to their Needle-work, point laces, &c. and if they come to poverty, those small Crafts may give them some mean releif.To which I answer, That having in some measure practised both Needle-work and Accounts I can averr, that I never found this Masculine Art harder or more difficult then the effeminate achievements of Lace-makeing, gum-work or the like, the attainment whereof need not make us proud: And God forbid that the praise of an useful Virtue should prompt us to a contrary Vice.Therefore if I might advise you, you should let the poor serve you
with these mean things, whilst by gaining or saving an estate you
shall never be out of capacity to store your selves more abundantly
with those trifles, then your own. industry in such matters could have
ever blest ye.AndAnd now Gentlewomen I give you those rudiments of Accounts, which are the subject of this little pamphlet and transmit this learning to you the best I can, in the self same manner as it came to me.Know then that my Parents were very careful to cause me to learn writing and Arithmetick, and in that I proceeded as far as Reduction, the Rule of Three and Practice, with other Rules, for without the knowledge of these I was told I should not be capable of Trade and Book-keeping and in these I found no discouragement for though Arithmetick set my brains at work, Yet there was much delight in seeing the end, and how each question produced a fair answer and informed me of things I knew not.Afterwards I was put to keep an exact account of the expence of House-keeping, and other petty Charges, my Father made it my office to call all
persons to an account every night what they had laid out, and to
reimburse it them, and set all down in a book, and this is the way to
make one a Cashier as they are termed, and one that. can keep a fair
account of receipts and payments of Money or Cash-book, is in a good
way towards the understanding of Book-keeping: shee that is so well versed in this as to keep the
          accounts of her Cash right and dailydaylyentredentered in a book fair without blotting, will soon be fit for greater undertakings.Now in regard that other learnings do depend upon this petty Cash account; I find it therefore convenient to give you an example of a moneths expence, and you will thereby see what further use may be made of it afterwards.Therefore to begin, my Father gives me at several times in the moneth of January, the sum of 21l. 17s. 11d, the account of the expences whereof is as followeth.ExeExpences in January 1676soll.s.d.January 1.Paid for book to keep these accounts12----4For 3 dozen of Candles10--169To the Scavenger 1m to Christmas last11--16For 2 bushels of Meal9--11--For a hood, scarf, apron and gloves11--186Coach hire to Westminster12--16For 12 larks and 18 snits8--210Given a Maid that brought a present12--1--For Beaf and Bacon8--4430 Eggs9--16For Roots and Herbs9----8For Drinking glasses11--16For Oysters8--443.For a Knife and Fork11--18Given to new Bedlam12--2--For Almonds and Rice10--1--For Eyewater10----44.For Salt Fish and Smelts8--7--For Herbs and Sallet9--1--For a pound of Butter9----9For earthen ware11----5For oil, Vinegar and Anchovis10--16For mending a hearth10--17For a pound of SaucigesSausages8----8carried over464soll.s.d.1676Brought over4464Janu.  5.Given to the poor12--1--For a quart of white-wine8--1--To a Physician10--10--For thred laces11----6For two washer women10--3--For 2 pound of SausagesSauciges8--1--6.For Fish8----6For a twelvetwelf -tide cake9--39For Bread9--2--For Soap and Bluing10--1--For Ale8----4For Fagots10----4For Needles11----1For Trolly lace11--76For Bacon8--16For Eggs9----68.For Meal and Flower9--116For a piece of Tape11--12For Fish8--13For Sand and Fullers earth11--14For Salt10----8For Mop and brooms11--159.For Riband and Tape11--62For Soap10----8For a knuckle of Veal8--1--For mending the Floor10--16For Apples, Roots and Herbs9----9For small coal and matches10----8For Brand9----4carried over7811soll.s.d.Brought over578111676To a Porter12----6Janu. 11.Oatcakes and wheat9--11For thirty eggs9--16For SausagesSaucidges and links8--24For a Mum-glass11----5To the poor12--1--For Veal for brothbroath8--1112.For fish and Anchovis8--34For bread and barley9----4For sallet and shallots9----3Paid the milk-womans score9--12For two pound of Sugar10--1113.For a Chalder of Coals10116For bone-lace11--22For Veal, Pork, tripe, &c.8--176For Mutton8--16--For Oatmeal9--1--For Herbs9----915.For a hood, tape, and threadthred11--103To a porter12----6For two pound of butter9--1--For fish8--24For a bottle of Vinegar10----6A quarters wages to the Maid end.

Which (being past and allowed) I am required to draw out in another form, and to make out, in particulars, how much thereof is Expended in Meat, how much in Bread and Meal, how much in Fish, &c. And so to sub divide, and branch out this Account into as many parcels as is convenient, to shew which way my Money goes, and put me upon Considering how I may lessen my Expences for the time to come. The Form of this Account, is as followeth.See the Reason of the Figures preceding the Column of Money in pag. 14.PageImage of Page 13I know not any thing that wants Explanation in these two several Accounts, except the Reason of the Figures preceding each Summe of Money: The use thereof is this. In the first Account, pag. 4. The first Article is 4d. paid for a Book; and the note of Reference thereto is 12. To shew that you have that Sum, and that parcel past to Account in page t 2. And in page 12, under the Title of Books and Schooling, I find the number of Reference to be 4, shewing that the Paid Entry of 4d. for a Book, was there Originally Entred, viz. in pag. 4.Now, why all this, you'l say?I Answer, were there no other reason than that, I might (from the second Account, wherein I do only set the Sum, and not recite for what) turn the readilier to the first Account, and see what it is for; this would recompence the trouble: But there is a further and great use thereof to be made in the keeping an Account of Trade, as shall be shewn in due place.And I do not doubt, but, that if Parents and Superiours imploy
their Children or Servants (one at a time, That is, one in one Year,
and another in another) in this or the like way of keeping the
Accounts of House Expences, or other petty Charges besides; the
satisfaction they will have to see how, and which way their Money
goes.) They will alto train up their Children to be regular and handy
in Accounts of greater Moment.
