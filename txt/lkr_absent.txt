(FOR THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY)TO MY ABSENT HUSBANDThou'rt gone!  Thou'rt gone! no more may I hearLove's lingering tones lowly breathed in my ear.My bower is desolate where lately there shoneA bright beaming star - but now I'm alone.'Tis beautiful there, more brilliant the flowersOf autumn than those of the past summer hours,Sweet birds too are singing, but I hear not their layMy spirit is lonely for thou art away.Each favorite haunt tells me, dearest of thee,On my heart is thine image where'er I may be;When I call to the echo no sound is so sweetAs the name of all others I'd rather repeat;But thy country has called thee, in her hour of need,While the groans of her dying for victory plead,And I know that thy valor  in her service will shineThough thy strength may be feeble, her glory is thine!God shield thee in suffering, and keep thee from harmIn peace or in battle, in sunlight or storm,And memory, sweet memory illumine thy heartWith dreams of our past that ne'er may depart.Thou'rt away!  Thou'rt away, where the cannon's loud roarSends terror to thousands who'll hear it no more;There war wildly rages and dangers beset,Yet thy home and thy loved one thou'lt never forget.I gazed on thy form as it passed from my sight,Thine cager war charger exulting in might,And called in my anguish on the God of the free,Believing He'd watch o'er my brothers and thee.Each morning and evening our prayers will unite,That he may defend us in justice and right,Give us liberty and triumph with gladness again,And no more let battle cries sound o'er the plain.Rogers, Loula KendallLEOLA
