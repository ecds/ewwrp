GLIMPSES OF THE GREAT WORK WROUGHT BY

      GEORGIA DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACYBy Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers, Poet Laureate Georgia DivisionGo ask the hills the mighty hillsWhere neither church nor school were knownNo upward path to life and lightOr judgment at Jehovah's throne?And there 'tis found that woman's handsHave reared a shrine where love abides,Where education opes the wayAnd knowledge over mind presides.At Rabun Gap 'neath mountain heightWhat wondrous changes have been wrought!What stores of thought unlocked each dayAnd gems revealed 'till then unsought!O brave Bartow! Thy spirit dwellsOn every tree and sparkling rill,Each zephyr tells to passers by"Though dead, his fame is living still."At Liberty Hall, a mansion standsIn reverence to him who freely gaveHeart, hands and mind to train our youthAnd from a reckless life to saveHail gallant Stephens! In memory hail!Thy labor was never spent in vain,But illumined all who followed the gleamAnd in eternity they reign.The honored names of our Generals shrineAt many hospitals o'er the seaBearing comfort to each soldier braveAnd gratitude to U.D.C.In World War records Georgia wonThe highest prize!  And ne'er shall fadeThe gift of noble Hector churchWhen ten thousands at our feet were laid!Go ask the winds that sweep OconeeFar down the crimson hills of HallWhat wondrous stories they are singingOf Athens queenliest queen of allAh, there sweet Winnie Davis smilesAs daughters of heroes come afarTo life high and higher the banner of learing,Until its folds entwine a-star.Throughout all Georgia lands are foundMemorials of our "Boys in Gray."And truths of history certifyA stainless banner led their wayFrom broad Savannah on the eastTo Chattahoochee's rhythmic waveConfederate daughters ne'er have ceasedTo honor, revere and crown

	the brave.On mountain crest,Stone Mountain  a vision livesThe wonderous dream of Helen PlaneHeaven gave the hallowed CenotaphAll through the years it must remainOh mountain, speak with loving voice!The merit of they sons proclaim,And tell to cycling years that rollThey won by right, eternal fame!
