Little julia's Mission.Affectionately inscribed to the memory of little Julia Wright,

      infant daughter of my brother, Dr. T.R. Kendall, pastor of Trinity

      church, Atlanta.  The little motherless darling was called by the

      church "Our Baby."She came with cold December's snowOn angle pinions shining bright,A gleam of Heaven's morning rayilluminating our hearts with light.Earth fairer, brighter, warmer grew -And snow white lilies reared their crest,The robin sang a sweeter lay,When Baby came awhile to restShe whispered low a message sweetFrom Him who sent the gift of love,Another precious link betweenThis fleeting life and that above,A few brief hours passed in joy -Then swiftly o'er the starry skiesThe messenger returned , and boreThe mother home to Paradise.Ah, sudden darkness shrouded earthAs crushed - we passed beneath the rod,Our bleeding hearts could only hear"Be still - and know that I am God.""Thy will be done!" The answer lowFrom broken-hearted mourner came.Through chill the hearth, its sunlight fled,Still blessed by Thy holy name.For Thou hast left a precious charge,A soul immortal to our care,A pure, sweet gem from Eden's bowersTo tell us of the glory there.Ah, how we loved her!  Day by dayAs some new charm shone in her eye,We held her in a close embraceNe'er dreaming that she too must die.But e'n for her a message came,'Twas wafted on the summer breath,And we again with heavy heartA treasure give to thee, O, Death!A few short months our baby staid -Just long enough to win our love,And then her little mission doneShe sought her mother up above. - Loula Kendall Rogers
