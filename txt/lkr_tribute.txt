A Tribute Of LoveTo The Memory Of Miss Mildred Lewis Rutherford

      State and General Historian, From The United Daughters 

      Of The Confederacy.By The Poet Laureate Mrs Loula Kendall Rogers.When all the world is beaming bright oftimes there comes a cloud,And Nature droops in sympathy as the giant Oak is bowed,When a favorite flower gently pleads as if in search of aid,O tell me is there a land where Roses never fade?There is a land, a radiant Land, of one Eternal Day,No night is there, no storm of War to dim its golden ray,The thunder's roar, the battle shout, terrific war whoops cease,And all the universe repeats a song of Love and Peace.Our Georgia Rose transfigured, finds congenial friends anew,Her snow white purity acclaimed by all the great and true,The King of Kings has placed a Crown upon her brow so fairThen sorrow not -  but Oh, rejoice!  For her reward is there!Her service here was knowledge - transforming youthful mindUplifting Lucy Cobb with her learning most divine,Then when the day was over and stars illume the night,She was planning still for Georgia, and new ways to make it bright.Oh, who in all the world but she had ever penned a thought,On great Historic Records which her native State had wrought?Of the First Atlantic Steamer that ever sailed beneath the sun,Was surely manned in Georgia!  And Georgia surely won!She then upheld the veiling where all the Southland leadsIn Cotton Gins, and Missions where the Orphan sadly pleads,And where the South was first to grace the Presidential Chair,For Washington our leader, was a well known Hero there.Her Truths of History are well known and prove without a doubt,If blame was laid upon the South, she always brought it out,For Sovereignty, the Rights of State, her heart was ever trueHer path was always blessed with Truth and Honor's unfailing glue.Then let us follow the gleam she leaves, high up on land and sea,The Faith and Honor of noble aims for our glorious U.D.C.And when the day beams fade away, may angles waft aboveThe songs with which we greet her soul in Everlasting Love!Tennille, Georgia
