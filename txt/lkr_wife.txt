What I want my Wife to be.1 She must be an acrobat yet gentle as a catRiding, dancing, full of grace, with of course a pretty face.2 Tall and stately Full of vimYet with never a foolish whim.3 Just so she can make a cup of teaAnd all things nice for only me.4 I do not want my wife to cookNor even look into a book,But she must work my garden wellAnd make a lot of things to sell!5 I need a wife to broil my steakAnd have a plenty of cream and cake.6 She must know the intricate artOf cooking well a cherry tart.7 She must be a musician and never grow wearyOf playing for me when the day is so dreary.8 I want her to paddle her own canoeAnd allow me the same privilege too.9 Never to frown, never to scold,Never to say its too hot or too cold,But smile and smile and lively beThat's the kind of wife for me!10 I want her perfect - nothing lessMade to comfort and - to dress!11 If she wears a Merry Widow hatAnd overtime her hair a ratShould I deride and roughly chideAnd threaten there to ---Oh, no I'd kiss her cheek and sing"They are lovely dear, the very thing"!12 My help -- must be both funny and wiseTall and slim with sharp black eyes.
