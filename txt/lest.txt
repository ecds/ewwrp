FOREWORD.THIS book is inscribed to every individual woman and girl of Great Britain who to-day is bearing so heroically--so uncomplainingly--her own share of Britain's burden in this Great War. She is asked to give of her dearest and her best, to see the man she loves--husband, son, sweetheart or friend--go to fight his country's battles, to fight in the cause of justice and humanity and honour whilst she--mother, wife or sweetheart--must perforce stay at home and strive with all her might to hide her tears, to keep back the one little word which perhaps would shake the loved one's resolution, the one little word which might unnerve him and cause him to stay by her side. Indeed, the burden laid upon all the women and girls of Great Britain is no light one! and they are bearing it with all the heroism of their race. Their sorrow is great--and in that sorrow but one solace is left to them--that of thinking and planning and working for those who have so bravely gone. It is their skill, their industry, their devotion which makes our gallant soldiers' and sailors' lives at the post of duty a little more happy and a little more comfortable. The warm clothing, which loving fingers at home fashion for the magnificent man who fights on land or at sea, is a comfort not only to his body, but also for his heart, for it reminds him of home, of brave hands that work while brave lips are praying for him.It is to aid this work that this book has been compiled; it is to the workers that it is dedicated. Cheered by the patronage of a gracious Queen they will continue their labour of love so long as their fingers have the strength to wield needles and pins, and in the years to come, when the history of the twentieth century comes to be written, not its least heroic page will be the account of how the women and girls of Great Britain bore their part in the Great War by working for the material comfort of Britain's fighting men.EMMUSKA ORCZY.Snowfield, Bearsted, Kent.THE ROLL OF HONOUR.YOUR faces haunt me from the printed pages,The roll call of our valiant English dead;What woman's hands, I wonder, clung in parting?What woman's heart breaks now the shot is sped?We speak of Glory and the Cause you died for,We lay our homage on your bloodstained grave,Will Glory help to ease the women's anguishOr solace them for these dear dead they gave?Yea, surely.

dear Shepherd of the Sheep)I will say, "Who took the hurt?I present Christ's death and pain'Twixt Thine anger and these slain."Dear, they die in millionsFor a quarrel not their own;Look to this poor flock, Thy Son's,Harried all and overthrown.See, I lay Christ's Cross betweenDear, Thy justice and their sin.KATHERINE TYNAN.New Witness.MATER DOLOROSA.WHAT have I given thee,England, beloved of me?I have no gold for thy desolate,I have n spear to guard thy gate,My hands are weak on the harp of fateIn the hour of threnody.Yet have given, I;And England, my gifts lieFar from thee and thy sacred strand.I have given the hand that held my hand,The feet that once on my palm could stand,The hopes I was nourished by.All that I had, I give,The life that I bade live,The heart that my heart made to beat,The lips erstwhile on my lips so sweetThese have I given; is it not meetTo have striven that thou mayst strive?The day of France doth shrineThis only gift of mine;England, be it not made in vain,Be but thy glory great as our pain.We are glad to have given--would give againThe light of our days for thine!DOROTHY MARGARET STUART.British Review.ABI, VIATOR---.IF thou hast seen the standard dimDroop in its mesh of dust and grimeAbove the carven hands of himWho bore it in some ancient time;If thou hast seen the silent swordRust redly in its tattered sheath,Hast caught the echo of the wordThat flung an English glove at death,And yet thy pulses march unstirred,And still thy breath comes calm and slow,Pass on--no Englishman art thou!If thou canst hear and see to-dayThe distant clamour and the fume Of crimson fate, and yet canst say"The gain is mine, be theirs the doom."If thou thy unthrilled hands canst fold,If thou canst check thy seaward tread, Canst shun the dust and guard the gold,Thou hast no kinship with thy dead;Ah! if thy craven heart is cold,Pause not the perilous page to scan--Pass on--thou art no Englishman!But if the distant unisonOf swooping sword and flying dart,Of straining sail and muttering gun,Touches thy spirit and thy heart;If England's day and England's callFind thee a son of England, thenThou canst not falter--thou, nor allHer noble heritage of men;Pass on--she stands, although we fall,Pass on unshaken though stars shakeThyself canst tell what road to take!DOROTHY MARGARET STUART.British Review.A RE ALBERTO.Saluto Italico.O ALBERTO, biondo e leggendario re,Che nè lusinga menzognera ammaliaNe ferreo pugno piega--noi vorremmoMietere tutti i fiori dell'ItaliaE darli a te!Anche l'Italia contro l'oppressore Magnifica e furente combattè;Tra le antiche ferite nel suo cuore Una nuova ferita di dolore Aperta or s'è:Questa--che pur fremente di stupendaFerocia e di magnanimo fervoreIl popolo d'Italia, o eroico re,Nell'ora tua più sacra e più tremendaNon fu con te.ANNIE VIVANTI CHARTRES.Times.A TRIBUTE FROM ITALY.ALBERT, thou standest where the storm-cloud lowersUnvanquished in thy glorious defeat.Oh!

Cold-blooded game of death,With men 'gainst men as foes arrayed,--What pride of youth must yield life's precious breathEre to an end thy game be played!O devastating, desolating War, --What dirges follow thee! what dearthAnd blackened ruin, where thou goest, marThe goodly pleasantness of Earth!GRACE B. TOLLEMACHE.August 1st.SONNET.O YE to whom dear life is still most dear,Heed not the sirens' soft perfidious songThat bids you barter, for a brief term here,Abiding honour! As the martyr-throngFor love of Christ went stedfast to the stakeAnd by faith's rapturous power embraced the flame,So, gladly, ye, for your own Country's sake,Must court the fiery Fates that wound and maim!And if on valour's path to victory's end,Sweet life in one swift flash ye must renounce--Rejoice that your high lot should so transcendMan's common doom! The brave can die but once,But in your death, thrice-gloriously ye'll die,--For England, for men's hearths, and Liberty!GRACE E. TOLLEMACHE.September 1st.SONNET.ENGLAND! that thou wast faint of heart we said,Or inly thought; and that the wreath of baysDrooped on thy brow, withered with length of days,A dust-layered trophy of the age-long Dead:We wronged thee much! --Myriads this month have bledAnd died for thee, and though the end delays,There's not one that a daunted spirit betraysNor that for thee life's last drop would not shed!We deemed thy robes grown faded,--but fresh-dyedWe now behold them,--and their crimson dyeIs of thy sons' spilt blood, deep-hued and glowing:O England! thou art comely in thy prideAnd clad in glorious raiment, and thy goingIs as of one who goes to victory!GRACE E. TOLLEMACHE.October 1st.ONE NIGHT.I WALKED into a moon of gold last nightAcross grey sands she seemed to shine so bright.Wide, wide the sands until I met the sea,Cradle of moons, yet searchlights followed me.I asked the moon if creeping round the ZonesShe had seen good, or only poor things' bones."Pale faces I have seen, unconscious menBereft of struggling horror now and then."And sinking ships I see, and floating mines,And cries I hear, 'O God,' and choking whines.But later when the stars shine on the waveAnd give more light, I know the dead die brave."Passing so quickly from the things that count,Count to all mortal thoughts, to find the Fount,"Where angels pour elixir into bowls,Drink, not for broken hearts, but thirsty souls."And what on shore?" I asked, "the great DivideWhere rivers run, and trenches side by side?""There," the moon said, "the snow was on the groundAnd the frost pinched me as I beamed around."Red pools of gore, and ghastly shadows layIn deep dug corners, so I sank away."Let misty cloudlets sweep across my faceTo hide the earth, and give me heart of grace."Sudden the air seemed filled with eager breathOf great Adventurers, released from death,"And shaking blood from out their eyes and hairShouting for further knowledge here and there."I lighted these across the treacherous PathTo reach the garden of Life's aftermath."And as they sped in troops the great guns boomed,With flashes lightning swift, and dark hordes loomed,"And phantom shapes of patient warrior bands--Then more snow fell and shrouded all the lands.*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*	*Now pondering from the moon I turned again,Over the sands, back to our House of Pain.MILLICENT SUTHERLAND.British Hospital, Malo, Dunkirk, France.English Review.
