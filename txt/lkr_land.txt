The Land We Love.Dedicated to her Music ClassBYMRS. LOULA K. ROGERS.There's a Land to us far dearer,Than all others o'er which we may roam,And its radiant skies are clearer,'Tis the bright Sunny South, our home. Then aloud let us sing to her glory,And exalt it in music and song,Let her virtues be embalmed in story,As our voices the echo prolong.Oh, Georgia! The Star of the nation,Let rejoicing break forth on the air,Tho' misfortune hath spread desolation,Our hearts were brave enough to bear,'Till the clouds have retreated before us,And a Colquitt and a Candler o'er usThree cheers for the State that we love!Yes, the new Star of Liberty is dawning,And gladness will once more illume,The Night that has darkened out Morning,And o'er cast it with woe, and with gloom.Peace and plenty may smile now upon us,With a President to shield us from the storm,North and South, East and West forever,Three cheers for Tilden and Reform.
