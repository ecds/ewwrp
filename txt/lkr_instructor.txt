General R.E. Lee

      As An Instructor Of YouthThe golden chords attuned by theeNot as each alone, but through the limitlessExpanse of all Eternity shall throb.SouthwickA Prince among men!  A Hero greatWho peerless stand on mountain height,Far, far above the ---,A soul illumed in Heaven's own light!With manhood's noblest gifts bestowed,He might have held illustrious reignIn pomp and power, and homage dueA world wide statesman free of stain.And yet he chose what Kings may deemA lowly sphere.   From lofty heightHe saw ahead the future gleamThat onward led to Wisdom's light,Thus patiently his work was wroughtOn Mind immortal, ever free,And thus America's citizenshipGrow 'neath the Godlike soul of Lee!Mrs. Loula Kendall RogersTennille, GeorgiaAbout General Lee
