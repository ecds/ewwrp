HARK! OUR BOYS ARE COMING HOME.TUNE: "Tramp, tramp, tramp, The Boys Are Marching Home"MRS. LOULA K. ROGERSDon't you see the clouds are breaking o'er the eastern lands today?And amid the rifts we see the shining blue?Don't you hear the trumpet calling up the boys so far away,The millions of America so true?CHORUSTramp, tramp, tramp, the boys are coming!Let our cheers arise on high,Let the light be shining brightFor out victors in the fightAnd a thousand thanks for Liberty and Right!O'er each mothers heart is falling tears of love and hope and joy,And the young are planning fesivals so gay,All the nation is rejoicing that her gallant soldier boyHas reached the top and triumphed in the fray.Then hurrah for ChristmasDixie Soldierscarol, and the pearly mistletoe!The smoking viands ready for the feast,Remember needy orphans whatsoever we may do,And thank out God this wretched war has ceased.
