FOR THE TWENTYSEVENTH BIRTHDAY

      Of the Willie Hunt Smith Chapter of Daughters of the Confederacy,

      Organized by Mrs. Loula Kendall Rogers as the Barnesville Chapter,

      On the 27th of March 1896One day as glorious Spring time cameto scatter Winter's gloom away,A faithful circle pledged their nameTo honor due them shall be paid,Their wondrous fame shall never die!The ship was launched.  The valiant crewMoved onward toward the shining goal,And day by day its numbers grew,Till three score glorified the roll!Then Georgia's great and gifted men,As April brought Memorial Day,Renewed each patriot soul againWith memories of "The Gallant Gray."Instructors, preachers, merchants all,And brave cadets with pride uniteIn heeding thus the bugle call,To honor chivalry and right,And there with loyal hand each year,I placed the rose and violet,Till sorrows came with parting tearAnd broken home!  Can I forget?And then the "Old Guard" bade adieu,As gentle faithful Mrs. NealAssumed the duties ever true With love and hope and earnest zeal.Alas!  She has gone! but far aboveHer spirit still is hovering o'erUnited there in Heavenly loveWith our faithful members gone before.Amid the shadows came a gleam Of radiant light!  That ship most braveEach cloud of fate, each flickering beam,And should ne'er be gulphed in stormy wave,So one was chosen then to steer,Whose love and beauty in her youthBrought in their train sweet smiles of cheer,And from her life the gems of Truth.Willie Hunt Smith!  Bring flowers bright,To wreath upon sunlit prow,While o'er the wave a holy lightIllumes with love each patriots brow.The kindly word, the smile that cheeredCan never from our soul departAnd features fair by love endearedWill ever live within the heart!Full twenty-seven years have passed,Our monuments have sprung to view,And yet the fields ahead are vast,With much we hope in time to do.With Mrs. Peacock, faithful guideAnd pilot o'er the summer sea,With Loyal heart we will abideForever true to U. D. C.For the Willie Hart Smith
