A Contemplation on Bassets-down-Hill by the most Sacred adorer of the Muses
Mrs A. K.If that exact Appelles now did live.And would a picture of Elizium give;He might pourtrai' of the prospect which this HillDoth shew; & make the eie command at will.Heer's many a shire whose pleasauntness for fightDoth yield to the Spectators great delight.Ther's a large Field guilded with ceres gold;Here a green mead doth many Heifers hold;Ther's pasture growne with virdant grass, whose store,Of Argent-sheep shewes th'owner is not poore.Here springs doe intricate Meanders makeExcelling farr Oblivion's Lethe Lake.There woods and Coppisses harbour as manyAnd sweet melodious Choristers, as anyElizium yields; whose Philomel' an lazesMerit the highest of the Lyrick's praiseHeer's Flora deck't with robes of Or, and Azur,Fragrently smelling yield's two senses pleasure.Hence Zephirus doth breath his gentle galesCoole on the Hills, and sweet throughout the ValesHow happy are they that in this Climate dwell?Alas! they can't their owne sweet welfare tell;Scarce I my selfe whil'st I am here doe know itTill I fee it's Antithesis to shew it.Here are no smoaking streets, nor howling cryes,Deafning the eares, nor blinding of the eyes;No noysome smells t' infect, and choake the aire;breeding diseases envious to the Faire.Deceipt is here exil'd from Flesh, and Bloud: (Strife only reigns, for all strive to be good.)With Will his verse I here will make an endAnd as the crab doth alwaies backward bendSo, though from this sweet place I goe awayMy loyall heart will in this Climate stay.Thus heartless, doth my worthless body restWhilest my heart liveth with the ever blest.
