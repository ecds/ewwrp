This is the poem that was written after visiting the Mountain in 1858The Stone Mountain Of Georgia in the Long Ago.One of the Wonders of the World.  Not a mass of loose

      rocks, but one mighty solid stone that lifts its regal

      crest far above all the surrounding country.One pleasant day when Autumn's QueenHad donned her vestal garments bright,And Nature wore a smile sereneOf tranquil pride in her delight,A sylvan Spirit whispered lowOf beautiful flowers and woodland dells,Where never ceasing waters flow,And Oreander wander from their cells.Her voice still lingered on the airA light illumed a towering Mount,And on we followed free from careTill the echo led us to a fountOf crystal water pure and clear,Where Oak and Ash in beauty greatNear mossy rocks where every treeWas spangled with the glittering dew.Ah, here then was the Sylvan QueenWho called us thither!  My young heartThrilled Wildly o'er the inspiring scene Thus woven round me to impartEnchantment never dreamed before,For high above us in the airThrough rift of chord that floated o'erWas God's own mighty Presence there!And Oh, the grandeur of scenes belowAs spreading fields and hill and valeGrew brighter when the sunset glowCrept o'er each mead and flowery dale!Old Kennesaw in azure hueSaluted Yonah from afar,And Chattahoochee pledged anewAllegiance to the Evening Star.O here was beauty in a dressOf brilliancy and grandeur rare,Which gave my soul the power to blessThe power of Him who placed it there!And Memory saved without alloy,Through weal or woe the future bring,Shall still recall my girlhood joyWhen first I saw this Mountain KingLoula W.
