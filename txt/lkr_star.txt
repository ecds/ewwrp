The New Star1I was musing in the twilight of a bright andbeauteous land.Of its lovely streams, its placid lakes, andhoary mountains grand.Twas strewn with flowers of every hue andbore upon its breast -A gem whose brightness far exceeds the purestdiamond crest.2There was beauty in its valleys, in its fountainsand its rills,And happiness with viewless touch awakedto joy its hills,There was beauty in its banner as it gracefullyunfurled,Its triple folds in triumph o'er and alladmiring world.3With blessings heaven crowned it - all was beauty,peace and love,The angles smiled upon it from the star gemmedvault above,A thrill of joy rushed o'er my soul, thosefoaming torrents grand -And those mighty streams were sparkling inmy own, my native land!4Then the shadowy veil of night came down and oh, what darkness drearFell on my beauteous visions so lately filledwith cheer,In agony I wildly wept - all happiness had fled,And before me was a bloody pall, wherePeace lay cold and dead!5What maniac horde had thither rushed,what demon of the air -What fiery brand and withering breath, hadwrought the ruin there?Who barred the glorious sunlight from thosesweet Magnolia bowersAnd sprinkled human blood upon thosefairy fruits and flowers?6Columbia! My native land, oh where isnow thy boast,The united hope and destiny of thyfreedom-loving host?Thy glory has departed, and a guiltyerring oneWith brothersbrothers' blood would desecrate the homeof Washington.7The night is black around thee - will itne'er be light again,Will the crimson blood like rivers flowupon each sunny plain?Alas! the temple is divided, thenList:whyA thousandshould cannon roar,cannons roar,AndAnd thundering tones butre-echo "We'reAre weparted evermore"?Come, sacred Peace, above us, for wenever more can be,United with the tyrants, who wouldSubjugate the free,8Yes, the veil is rend asunder! See howhuman passions swellFor every thundering echo is a solemnFuneral KnellOh, God in pity hear us! Send a messageof PeaceTo quell the roaring -- and their mighty--cease.9In comparison came this answer, OnThe ruins there a rayBringing to the worn and weary --of a brighter dayAll honor to the nation born - the beautifulNew StarThat gleams above oppression like an angelfrom afar.10Star of the South! Where e'er I gaze thyradiant light is thereAnd 'neath its ray my Cosrotsyspirit kneels ingratitude and prayerShine on through endless ages o'er the fieldby heroes trodthat lead each Southern patriot onto glory and to GodAll honor to the nation born, the beautifunew star,that gleams above oppressiuon like an angelfrom afar.Star of the South! Where e'er I gazethy peaceful light is there,And 'neath its ray a nation bows ingratitude and prayer,Shine on, through endless ages, o'er thefields by heroes trodAnd light each noble patriot to glory andto God!Copied from my original piece by Mrs R.
