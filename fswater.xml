which, in attempting to be at once a story and a history, probably
fails in either aim.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13012" rend="italic">That, however, is for the reader to say. As the
writer, I have only to point out where my history ends, my story
begins, and clear the way for criticism. Briefly, then, I have not
allowed fiction to interfere with fact in the slightest degree. The
reader may rest assured that every incident bearing in the remotest
degree on the Indian Mutiny, or on the part which real men took in
it, is scrupulously exact, even to the date, the hour, the scene, the
very weather. Nor have I allowed the actual actors in the great
tragedy to say a word regarding it which is not to be found in the
accounts of eye-witnesses, or in their own writings.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13014" rend="italic">In like manner, the account of the sham court at
Delhi—which I have drawn chiefly from the lips of those who
saw it—is pure history; and the picturesque groups of schemers
and dupes—all of whom have passed to their account—did
not need a single touch of fancy in its presentment. Even the story
of Abool-Bukr and Newâsi is true; save that I have supplied a
cause for an estrangement, which undoubtedly did
<pb xml:id="fswater_13013" n="vi PREFACE"/>
come to a companionship of which none speak evil. So much for my
facts.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13015"><hi rend="italic">Regarding my fiction. An Englishwoman</hi> was
<hi rend="italic">concealed in Delhi, in the house of an Afghan, and
succeeded in escaping to the Ridge just before the siege. I have
imagined another; that is all. I mention this because it may possibly
be said that the incident is incredible.</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_13016" rend="italic">And now for a word about my title. I have chosen it
because when you ask an uneducated native of India why the Great
Rebellion came to pass, he will, in nine cases out of ten, reply,
'God knows! He sent a Breath into the World.' From this to a Spirit
moving on the face of the Waters is not far. For the rest I have
tried to give a photograph—that is, a picture in which
differentiation caused by colour is left out—of a time which
neither the fair race nor the dark one is ever likely quite to
forget or to forgive.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13017" rend="italic">That they may come nearer to the latter is the
object with which this book has been written.</p><bibl rend="italic"><name type="person">F.A.

Going! Gone!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13022">The Western phrase echoed over the Eastern scene without a trace of
doubt in its calm assumption of finality. It was followed by a pause,
during which, despite the crowd thronging the wide plain, the only
recognisable sound was the vexed yawning purr of a tiger impatient for
its prey. It shuddered through the sunshine, strangely out of keeping
with the multitude of men gathered together in silent security; but on
that March evening of the year 1856, when the long shadows of the
surrounding trees had begun to invade the sunlit levels of grass by
the river, the lately deposed King of Oude's menagerie was being
auctioned. It had followed all his other property to the hammer, and a
perfect Noah's Ark of wild beasts was waiting doubtfully for a change
of masters.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13023">'Going! Going! Gone!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13024">Those three cabalistic words, shibboleth of a whole hemisphere's
greed of gain, had just transferred the proprietary rights in an old
tusker elephant for the sum of eighteenpence. It is not a large price
to pay for Leviathan, even if he be lame, as this one was. Yet the new
owner looked at his purchase distastefully, and even the auctioneer
sought support in a gulp of brandy and water.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13026">'Fetch up them pollies, Tom,' he said in a dejected whisper to a
soldier, who, with others of the fatigue party on duty, was trying to
hustle refractory lots into position. 'They'll be a change after
elephants--go off lighter like. Then there's some of them La
Martiniery boys comin' down again<pb xml:id="fswater_13025" n="2 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> as ran up the fightin' rams this mornin'--Wonder wot the
'ead master said! But boys is allowed birds, and Lord knows we want to
be a bit brisker than we 'ave bin with <hi rend="italic">guj-putti</hi>. But there! it's slave-drivin' to screw
bids for beasts as eats hunderweights out of poor devils as 'aven't
enough for themselves, or a notion of business as business.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13027">He shook his head resentfully yet compassionately over the
impassive dark faces around. He spoke as an auctioneer; yet he gave
expression to a very common feeling which in the early fifties, when
the commercial instincts of the West met the uncommercial ones of the
East in open market for the first time, sharpened the antagonism of
race immensely--that inevitable antagonism when the creed of one
people is that Time is Money, of the other that Time is Naught.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13028">From either standpoint, however, the auction going on down by the
river Goomtee was confusing; even to those who, knowing the causes
which had led up to it--the unmentionable atrocities, the crass
incapacity on the one hand, the unsanctioned treaties and crave for
civilisation on the other--were conscious of a distinct flavour of
Sodom and Gomorrah, the Ark of the Covenant and the Deluge all
combined, as they watched the just and yet unjust retribution going
on. But such spectators were few, even in the outer fringe of English
onlookers pausing in their evening drive or ride to gratify their
curiosity. The long reports and replies regarding the annexation of
Oude which filled the office boxes of the elect were unknown to them,
so they took the affair as they found it. The King, for some reason
satisfactory to the authorities, had been exiled, majesty being thus
vested in the representatives of the annexing race: that is in
themselves--a position which comes naturally to most Englishmen.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13030">To the silent crowds closing round the auctioneer's table, the
affair was simple also. The King, for some unsatisfactory reason, had
been ousted from his own. His goods and chattels were being sold. The
valuable ones had been knocked down for a mere song--just to keep up
the farce of sale--to the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi>. The
rubbish--lame elephants and such like--was being sold to them; more or
less against their will, since who could forbear bidding sixpence for
a whole leviathan. That this was in a measure inevitable, that these
new-come <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> were bound to supply their wants
cheaply when a<pb xml:id="fswater_13029" n="3 GOING, GOING, GONE"/> whole <hi rend="italic">posse</hi> of carriages and horses, cattle and furniture
was thrown on an otherwise supplied market, did not, of course, occur
to those who watched the hammer fall to that strange new cry of the
strange new master. When does such philosophy occur to crowds? So when
the waning light closed each day's sale and the people drifted back
citywards over the boat-bridge they were no longer silent. They had
tales to tell of how much the barouche and pair, or the Arab charger
had cost the King when he bought it. But then Wajeed Ali, with all his
faults, had never been a bargainer. He had spent his revenues right
royally, thus giving ease to many. So one could tell of a purse of
gold flung at a beggar, another of a life pension granted to a tailor
for inventing a new way of sewing spangles to a waistcoat; for there
had been no lack of the insensate munificence in which lies the
oriental test of royalty, about the King of Oude's reign.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13031">Despite this talk, however, the talkers returned day after day to
watch the auction; and on this, the last one, the grassy plain down by
the Goomtee was peaceful and silent as ever save for the occasional
cry of an affrighted hungry beast. The sun sent golden gleams over the
short turf worn to dustiness by crowding feet, and the long curves of
the river, losing themselves on either side among green fields and
mango trees, shone like a burnished shield. On the opposite bank, its
minarets showing fragile as cut paper against the sky, rose the
Chutter Munzil--the deposed King's favourite palace. Behind it, above
the belt of trees dividing the high Residency gardens from the maze of
houses and hovels still occupied by the hangers-on to the late Court,
the English flag drooped lazily in the calm floods of yellow
light. For the rest, were dense dark groves following the glistening
curve of the river, and gardens gravely gay in pillars of white <hi rend="italic">chum-baeli</hi> creeper and cypress, long prim lines of
latticed walls, and hedges of scarlet hibiscus. Here and there above
the trees, the dome of a mosque or the minaret of a mausoleum told
that the town of Lucknow, scattered yet coherent, lay among the
groves; the most profligate town in India which, by one stroke of an
English pen, had just been deprived of the <hi rend="italic">raison-d'être</hi> of its profligacy, and been
bidden to live as best it could in cleanly, court-less poverty.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13033">So, already, there were thousands of workmen in it, innocent enough
panderers in the past to luxurious vice, who<pb xml:id="fswater_13032" n="4 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> were feeling the pinch of hunger from lack of
employment; and there were those past employers also, deprived now of
pensions and offices, with a bankrupt future before them. But Lucknow
had a keener grievance than these in the new tax on opium, the drug
which helps men to bear hunger and bankruptcy. So, as the auctioneer
said, it was not a place in which to expect brisk bidding for wild
beasts with large appetites; but the parrots roused a faint interest,
and the crowd laughed suddenly at the fluttering screams of a red and
blue macaw, as it was tossed from hand to hand on its way to the
surprised and reluctant purchaser who had bid a farthing for it out of
sheer idleness.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13034">'Another mouth to feed, Shumshu!' jeered a fellow-butcher, as he
literally flung the bird at a neighbour's head.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13035">'Rather he than I,' laughed the recipient, continuing the
fling. '<hi rend="italic">Ari</hi>! Shumshu, take thy baby. Well
caught, brother! but what will thy house say?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13036">'That I have made a fat bargain,' retorted the big coarse owner
coolly as he wrung the bird's neck, and twirled it, a quivering tuft
of bright feathers and choking cries, above his head. 'Thou'llt buy no
meat at a farthing a pound, even from <hi rend="italic">my</hi> shop
I'll swear, and this bird weighs two, and is delicate as chicken.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13037">The laugh which answered the sally held a faint scream, not wholly
genuine in its ring. It came from the edge of the crowd, where two
English riders had paused to see what the fun was about.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13038">'Cruel devils, arn't they, Allie?' said one, a tall fair man whose
good looks were at once made and marred by heaviness of feature. 'Why!
you've turned pale despite the rouge!' His tone was full of not
over-respectful raillery, his bold bloodshot eyes met his companion's
innocent-looking ones with careless admiration.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13039">'Don't be a fool, Erlton,' she replied promptly; and the even,
somewhat hard pitch of her voice did not match the extreme softness of
her small, childish face. 'You know I don't rouge; or you ought
to. And it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> horrible, in its way.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13040">'Only what your ladyship's cook does to your ladyship's fowls,'
retorted Major Erlton. 'You don't see it done, that's all the
difference. It is a cruel world, Mrs. Gissing, the sex is the
cruellest thing in it, and you, as I'm always telling you, are the
cruellest of your sex.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_13041" n="5 GOING, GOING, GONE"/><p xml:id="fswater_13042">His manner was detestable, but little Mrs. Gissing laughed
again. She had not a fine taste in such matters; perhaps because she
had no taste for them at all. So, in the middle of the laugh, her
attention shifted to the big white cockatoo which formed the next
lot. It had a most rumpled and dejected appearance as it tried to keep
its balance on the ring, which the soldier assistant swung backwards
and forwards boisterously. 'Do look at that ridiculous bird!' she
exclaimed, 'Did you ever see any creature look so foolish ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13043">It did, undoubtedly, with its wrinkled grey eyelids closed in
agonised effort, its clattering grey beak bobbing rhymthically towards
its scaly grey legs. It roused the auctioneer from his depression,
into beginning in grand style--'Now then, gentlemen! This is a real
treat, indeed! A cockatoo old as Methusalem and twice as wise. It
speaks I'll be bound. Says 'is prayers--look at 'im gemyflexing! and
may be he swears a bit like the rest of us. Any gentleman bid a
rupee!--a eight annas?--a four annas? Come, gentlemen!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13044">'One anna,' called Mrs. Gissing, with a coquettish nod to the big
Major, and a loud aside--'Cruel I may be to you, sir, but I'll give
that to save the poor brute from having its neck wrung.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13045">'Two annas!' There was a stress of eagerness in the new voice which
made many in the crowd look whence it came. The speaker was a lean old
man wearing a faded green turban, who had edged himself close to the
auctioneer's table, and stood with upturned eyes watching the bird
anxiously. He had the face of an enthusiast, keen, remorseless,
despite its look of ascetic patience.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13046">'Three annas!' Alice Gissing's advance came with another nod at her
big admirer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13047">'Four annas!' The reply was quick an echo.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13048">A vexed surprise showed on the pretty babyish face. 'What an
impertinent wretch! Eight annas--do you hear?--eight annas!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13049">The auctioneer bowed effusively. 'Eight annas bid for a cockatoo as
she says--' he paused cautiously, for the bidding was brisk enough
without exaggeration--'Eight annas once--twice--Going! going--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13050">'One rupee!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13051">Mrs. Gissing gave a petulant jag to her rein. 'Oh come away,
Erlton, my charity doesn't run to rupees.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_13052" n="6 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_13053">But her companion's face, never a very amiable one, had darkened
with temper. 'D--n the impudent devil,' he muttered savagely, before
raising his voice to call--'Two rupees!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13054">'Five!' There was no hesitation still; only an almost clamorous
anxiety in the worn old voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13055">'Ten!' Major Erlton's had lost its first heat, and settled into a
dull decision which made the auctioneer turn to him, hammer in
hand. Yet the echo was not wanting.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13056">'Fifteen!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13057">The Englishman's horse backed as if its master's hand lay heavy on
the bit. There was a pause, during which that shuddering cough of the
hungry tiger quavered through the calm flood of sunshine, in which the
crowd stood silently, patiently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13058">'Fifteen rupees,' began the auctioneer reluctantly, his sympathies
outraged, 'Fifteen once, twice--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13059">Then Alice Gissing laughed. The woman's laugh of derision which is
responsible for so much.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13060">'Fifty rupees,' said Major Erlton at once.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13061">The old man in the green turban turned swiftly; turned for the
first time to look at his adversary, and in his face was intolerant
hatred mingled with self-pity; the look of one who, knowing that he
has justice on his side, knows also that he is defeated.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13062">'Thank <hi rend="italic">you</hi> sir' caught up the
auctioneer. 'Fifty once, twice, thrice. Hand the bird over, Tom. Put
it down, sir, I suppose with the other things?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13063">Major Erlton nodded sulkily. He was already beginning to wonder why
he had bought the brute. Meanwhile Tom, still swinging the cockatoo
derisively, had jumped from the table into the crowd round it as if
the sea of heads was nonexistent; being justified of his rashness by
its prompt yielding of foothold as he elbowed his way outward,
shouting for room goodnaturedly, and answered by swift smiles and
swifter obedience. Yet both were curiously silent; so that
Mrs. Gissing's voice, wondering what on earth Herbert was going to do
with the creature now that he had bought it, was distinctly
audible.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13065">'Give it to you, of course,' he replied moodily 'You can wring its
neck if you choose, Allie. You are cruel enough for that I daresay.'
The thought of the fifty rupees wasted<pb xml:id="fswater_13064" n="7 GOING, GOING, GONE"/> was rankling fiercely. Fifty rupees! when he would be hard put
to it for a penny if he didn't pull off the next race. Fifty rupees!
because a woman laughed!</p><p xml:id="fswater_13066">But Mrs. Gissing was laughing again. 'I shan't do any thing of the
kind. I shall give it to your wife, Major Erlton. I'm sure she must be
dull all alone; and then she loves prayers! The absolute effrontery of
the speech was toned down by her indifferent expression. 'Here,
sergeant!' she went on 'hold the bird up a bit higher, please, I want
to see if it is worth all that money. Gracious! what a hideous
brute!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13067">It was, in truth, save for the large gold-circled eyes, like
strange gems, which opened suddenly as the swinging ceased. They
seemed to look at the dainty little figure, taking it in; and then, in
an instant, the dejected feathers were afluff, the wings outspread,
the flame-coloured crest, unseen before, was raised like a fiery flag
as the bird gave an ear-piercing scream.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13068"><hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen! Futteh Mahomed.'</hi> (For the Faith!
For the Faith! victory to Mahomed.)</p><p xml:id="fswater_13069">The war cry of the fierciest of all faiths was unmistakable; the
first two syllables cutting the air, keen as a knife, the last with
the blare as of a trumpet in them. And following close on their heels
came an indescribable sound, like the answering vibration of a church
to the last, deep, organ-note. It was a faint murmur fron the crowd
till then so silent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13070">'Damn the bird! Hold it back, man! Loosen the curb, Allie, for
God's sake! or the brute will be over with you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13071">Herbert Erlton's voice was sharp with anxiety as he reined his own
horse savagely out of the way of his companion's, which, frightened at
the unexpected commotion, was rearing badly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13072">'All right,' she called; there was a little more colour on her
child-like face, a firmer set of her smiling mouth: that was all. But
the hunting crop she carried fell in one savage cut after another on
the startled horse's quarters. It plunged madly, only to meet the bit
and a dig of the spur. So, after two or three unavailing attempts to
unseat her, it stood still with pricked ears and protesting
snorts.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13073">'Well sat, Allie! By George you can ride! I do like to see pluck in
a woman; especially in a pretty one.' The Major's temper and his fears
had vanished alike in his admiration. Mrs. Gissing looked at him
curiously.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_13074" n="8 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_13075">'Did you think I was a coward ?' she asked lightly; and then she
laughed 'I'm not so bad as all that. But look! There is your wife
coming along in the new victoria--it's an awfully stylish turn-out,
Herbert, I wish Gissing would give me one like it. I suppose she has
been to church. It's Lent or something isn't it? Anyhow she can take
that screaming beast home.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13076">'You're not'--, began the Major; but Mrs. Gissing had already
ridden up to the carriage, making it impossible for the solitary
occupant to avoid giving the order to stop. She was rather a pale
woman who leant listlessly among the cushions.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13077">'Good evening, Mrs. Erlton,' said the little lady 'been, as you
see, for a ride. But we were thinking of you and hoping you would pray
for us in church.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13078">Kate Erlton's eyebrows went up as they had a trick of doing when
she was scornful. 'I am only on my way thither as yet,' she replied;
'so that now I am aware of your wishes I can attend to them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13079">The obvious implication roused the aggressor to great
recklessness. 'Thanks! but we really deserve something, for we have
been buying a parrot for you. Erlton paid a whole fifty rupees for it
because it said its prayers and he thought you would like it!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13080">'That was very kind of Major Erlton--'--there was a fine irony in
the title--'but, as he knows, I'm not fond of things with gay feathers
and loud voices.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13081">The man listening, moved his feet restlessly in his stirrups. It
was too bad of Allie to provoke these sparring matches; foolish too,
since Kate's tongue was sharp when she chose to rouse herself.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13082">'If you don't want the bird,' he interrupted shortly, 'tell the
groom to wring its neck.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13083">Mrs. Gissing looked at him, her reproachful blue eyes perfect wells
of simplicity. 'Wring its neck! How can you, when you paid all that
money to save it from being killed? That is the real story,
Mrs. Erlton; it is indeed--"</p><p xml:id="fswater_13085">He interrupted his wife's quick glance of interest
impatiently. 'The main point being that I had, or shall have to pay
fifty rupees--which I must get. So I must be off to the racecourse if
I don't want to be posted. I ought to have been there a quarter of an
hour ago; should have been<pb xml:id="fswater_13084" n="9 GOING, GOING, GONE"/> but for
that confounded bird. Are you coming, Mrs. Gissing, or not?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13086">'Now, Erlton!' she replied, 'don't be stupid. As if he didn't know,
Mrs. Erlton, that I am every bit as much interested as he is in the
match with that trainer man!--what's his name, Erlton?--Greyman-isn't
it? I have endless gloves on it, sir, so of course I 'm coming to see
fair play.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13087">Major Erlton shot a rapid glance at her, as if to see what she
really meant; then muttered something angrily about chaff as, with a
dig of his heels, he swung his horse round to the side of hers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13088">Kate Erlton. watched their figures disappear behind the trees, then
turned indifferently to the groom who was waiting for orders with the
cockatoo; but she started visibly in finding herself face to face with
a semi-circle of spectators which had gathered about the figure of an
old man in a faded green turban who stood close beside the groom, and
who, seeing her turn, salaamed, and with clasped minds began an appeal
of some sort. So much she gathered from his bright eyes, his tone; but
no more, and so all unconsciously she drew back to the furthest corner
of the carriage, as if to escape from what she did not understand and
therefore did not like. That, indeed, was her attitude towards all
things native; though at times, as now, she felt a dim regret at her
own ignorance. What did he want? What were they thinking of, those
dark incomprehensible faces closing closer and closer round her? What
could they be thinking of? Uncivilised, heathen, as they were--tied to
hateful horrible beliefs and customs--unmentionable thoughts! So the
innate repulsion of the alien overpowered her dim desire to be
kind.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13089">'Drive on!' she called in her clear soft voice, 'drive on to the
church.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13090">The grooms, new taken from royal employ--for the victoria had been
one of the spoils of the auction--began their arrogant shouting to the
crowd; the coachman, treating it also in royal fashion, cut at his
horses regardless of their plunging. So, after an instant's scurry and
flurry, a space was cleared, and the carriage rolled off. The old man,
left standing alone, looked after it silently for a moment, then flung
his arms skyward.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_13091" n="10 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_13092">'O God, reward them! reward them to the uttermost!' he cried. The
appeal, however, seemed too indefinite for solace, and he turned for
closer sympathy to the crowd.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13093">'The bird is mine, brothers! I lent it to the King, to teach his
the Cry-of-Faith that I had taught it. But the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> would not listen, or they would not
understand. It was a little thing to them! So I brought all I had,
thinking to buy mine own again. But yonder hell-doomed infidel hath it
for nothing--for he paid nothing; and here-here is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> money!' He drew a little bag from his breast and
held it up with shaking hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13094">'For nothing?' echoed the crowd, seizing on what interested it
most. 'For sure he paid nothing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13095">The murmur, spreading from man to man in doubt, wonder, assertion,
was interrupted by a voice with the resonance and calm in it of one
accustomnd to listeners. 'Nay! not for nothing. Have patience. The
bird may yet give the Great Cry in the house of the thief. I
Ahmed-oolah, the dust of the feet of the Most High, say it. Have
patience. God settles the accounts of men.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13096">'It is the Moulvie,' whispered some, as the gaunt hollow-eyed
speaker moved out of the crowd, a good head-and-shoulders taller than
most there. 'The Moulvie from Fyzabad. He preaches in the big Mosque
to-night, and half the city goes to hear him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_13097">The whispering voices formed a background to that recurring cry of
the auctioneer, 'Going! Going! Gone!' as lot after lot fell to the
hammer, while the crowd listened to both, or drifted citywards with
the memory of them lingering insistently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_13099">'Going! Going! Gone!' What was going? Everything, if tales were
true; and there were so many tales now-a-days. Of news flashed faster
by wires than any, even the Gods themselves, could flash it; of
carriages, fire-fed, bringing God knows what grain from God knows
where! Could a body eat of it and not be polluted? Could the children
read the school books and not be apostate? Burning questions these,
not to be answered lightly. And as the people, drifting homewards in
the sunset, asked them, other sounds assailed their ears--the
long-drawn chant of the call to prayer from the Mahomedan mosques, the
clashings of gongs from the Hindoo temples, the solitary clang of the
Christian church<pb xml:id="fswater_13098" n="11 GOING, GOING, GONE"/> bell; diverse, yet
similar in this, that each called Life to face Death, not as an end,
but as a beginning. Called with more insistence than usual in the
church, where a special missionary service was being held, at which a
well-known worker in the vineyard was to give an address on the duty
of a faithful soldier of Christ in a heathen land; with greater
authority in the mosque also, where the Moulvie was to lay down the
law for each soldier of the faith in an age of unbelief and
change. Only in the Hindoo temples the circling lights flickered as
ever, and there was neither waxing nor waning of worship as mortality
drifted in, and drifted out, hiding the rude stone symbol of
regeneration with their chaplets of flowers--the symbol of
Life-in-Death, of Death-in-Life--the cult of the Inevitable.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130100">There was no light in these dark shrines, save the circling
cresset; none, save the dim reflection of dusk from white marble, in
the mosque where the Moulvie's sonorous voice sent the broad Arabic
vowels rebounding from dome to dome. But in the church there was a
blaze of lamps, and the soldierly figure at the reading desk showed
clear to the men and women listening leisurely in the cushioned
pews. Yet the words were stirring enough; there was no lack of
directness in them. Kate Erlton, resting her chin on her hand, kept
her eyes on the speaker closely as his voice rose in a final
confession of the faith that was in him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130101">'I conceive it is ever the hope and aim of a true Christian that
his Lord should make him the happy instrument of rescuing his
neighbour from eternal damnation. In this belief I find it my duty to
be instant in season and out of season, speaking to all, sepoys as
well as civilians, making no distinction of persons or place since
with the Lord there are no such distinctions. In temporal matters I
act under the orders of my earthly superior, but in spiritual matters
I own no allegiance save to Christ. So, in trying to convert my
sepoys, I act as a Christian soldier under Christ, and thus, by
keeping the temporal and spiritual capacities in which I have to act
clearly under their respective heads, I render unto Caesar the things
that are Caesar's, to God the things that are God's.'<ref target="#fswatern11">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern11" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">From Colonel Wheler's defence.</note></p><p xml:id="fswater_130103">There was a little rustle of satisfaction and relief from the<pb xml:id="fswater_130102" n="12 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> pews, the hymn closing the
service went with a swing, and the congregation, trooping out into the
scented evening air, fell to admiring the address.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130104">'And he looked so handsome and soldierly, didn't he?' said one
voice with a cadence of sheer comfortableness in it, as the owner
nestled back into a barouche.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130105">'Quite charming!' assented another. 'And to think of a man like
that, brave as a lion, submitting to be hustled off his own parade
ground because his sepoys objected to his preaching. It is an example
to us all!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130106">'I would'nt give much for the discipline of his regiment,' began
Kate Erlton, impulsively, then paused, certain of her hearers,
uncertain of herself; for she was of those women who use religion
chiefly as an anodyne for the heartache, leaving her intellect to take
care of itself; with the result that it revenged itself, as now, by
sudden flashes of reason which left her helpless before her own common
sense.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130107">'My dear Mrs. Erlton!' came a shocked coo, 'discipline or no
discipline, we are surely bound to fight the good--Gracious heavens!
what <hi rend="italic">is</hi> that ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130108">It was the cockatoo; roused from a doze by the movement of Kate's
carriage towards the church-door, it had dashed at once into the war
cry--<hi rend="italic">'Deen! Deen! Futteh Mahomed</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130109">The appositeness of the interruption, however, was quite lost on
the ladies, who were too ignorant to recognise it; so their alarm
ended in a laugh, and the suggestion that the bird would be a noisy
pet.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130110">Thus, with worldly gossip coming to fill the widening spaces in
their complacent piety, they drove homewards together where the
curving river shimmered faintly in the dark, or through scented
gardens where the orange-blossom showed as faintly among the leaves,
like star-dust on a dark sky.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130112">But Kate Erlton drove alone as she generally did. And as she drove,
her mind diverted listlessly to the semicircle of dark faces she had
left unanswered. What had they wanted? Nothing worth hearing, no
doubt! Nothing was worth much in this weary land of exile where the
heart-hunger for one little face and voice gnawed at your vitality day
and night; for Kate Erlton set<pb xml:id="fswater_130111" n="13 HOME SWEET HOME"/> down
all her discontent to the fact that she was separated from her
boy. Yet she had sent him home of her own free will to keep him from
growing up in the least like his father; And she had stayed with that
father simply to keep him within the pale of respectability for the
boy's sake. That was what she told herself. She allowed nothing for
her own disappointments; nothing for the keen craving for sentiment
which lay behind her refinement. All she asked from fate was that the
future might be no worse than the past; so that she could keep up the
fiction to the end.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130113">And as she drove, a sudden sound made her start, for--soldier's
wife though she was--the report of a rifle always set her heart
a-beating. Then from the darkness came a long-drawn howl; for over on
the other side of the river they were beginning to shoot down the
hungry beasts which all through the long sunny day had found no
master.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130114">The barter of <hi rend="italic">their</hi> lives was complete. The
last 'Going! Going! Gone!' had come, and they had passed to settle the
account elsewhere. So, amid this dropping fire of kindly-meant
destruction, the night fell soft and warm over the shimmering river,
and the scented gardens with the town hidden in their midst.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0102" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II<lb/>HOME SWEET
HOME!</head><p xml:id="fswater_130115">'YOU sent for me, I believe, Mrs. Erlton,'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130116">'Yes, Mr. Greyman, I sent for you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130118">Both voices came reluctantly into the persistent cooing of doves
which filled the room, for the birds were perched among a coral
begonia overhanging the verandah. But the man had so far the best of
it in the difficult interview which was evidently beginning, in that
he stood with his back to the French window through which he had just
entered; his face, therefore, was in shadow. Hers, as she paused,
arrested by surprise, faced the light. For Kate Erlton, when she sent
for James Greyman in the hopes of bribing him to silence regarding the
match which had been run the evening before<pb xml:id="fswater_130117" n="14 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> between his horse and her husband's, had not expected
to see a gentleman in the person of an ex-jockey, trainer, and general
hanger-on to the late King's stables. The diamonds with which she had
meant to purchase honour lay on the table; but this man would not take
diamonds. What would he take? She scanned his face anxiously, yet with
a certain relief in her disappointment; for the clean-shaven contours
were fine, if a trifle stern; and the mouth, barely hidden by a slight
moustache, was thin-lipped, well cut.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130119">'Yes! I sent for you,' she continued--and the even confidence of
her own voice surprised her,--'I meant to ask low much you would want
to keep this miserable business quiet; but now--' She paused, and her
hand, which had been resting on the centre table, shifted its position
to push aside the jewel-case; as if that were sufficient
explanation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130120">'But now?' he echoed formally, though his eyes followed the
action. She raised hers to his, looking him full in the face. They
were beautiful eyes, and their cold grey blue, with the northern glint
of steel in it, gave James Greyman an odd thrill. He had not looked
into eyes like these for many a long year; not since, in a room just
like this one, homely and English in every twist and turn of foreign
flowers and furniture, he had ruined his life for a pair of eyes, as
coldly pure as these, to look at. He did not mean to do it again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130121">'But now I can only ask you to be kind, and generous. Mr. Greyman!--I want you to save my husband from the
disgrace your claim must bring--if you press it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130122">Once more the monotonous cooing from outside filled the darkness
and the light of the large lofty room. For it was curiously dark in
the raftered roof and the distant corners; curiously light in the
great bars of golden sunshine slanting across the floor. In one of
them James Greyman stood, a dark silhouette against an arch of pale
blue sky, wreathed by the climbing begonia. He was a man of about
forty, looking younger than his age, taller than his real height, by
reason of his beardless face and the extreme ease and grace of his
figure. He was burnt brown as a native by constant exposure to the
sun; but as he stooped to pick up his glove which had slipped from his
hold, a rim of white showed above his wrist.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130124">'So I supposed; but why should I save him?' he said<pb xml:id="fswater_130123" n="15 HOME SWEET HOME"/> briefly. The question, thus crudely put, left her
without reply for a minute; during which he waited. Then, with a new
tinge of softness in his voice, he went on: 'It was a mistake to send
for me. I thought so at the time, though, of course, I had no option
save to come. But now--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130125">'But now?' she echoed in her turn.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130126">'There is nothing to be done save to go away again.' He turned at
the words, but she stopped him by a gesture.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130127">'Is there not?' she asked, 'I think there is, and so will you if
you understand--if you will wait and let me speak. His evident
impatience made her add quickly--'You can at least do so much for me,
surely?' There was a quiver in her voice now, and it surprised her as
her previous calm had done; for what was this man to her that his
unkindness should give pain?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130128">'Certainly', he said, pausing at once, 'but I understand too much,
and I cannot see the use of raking up details. You know them--or think
you do. Either way they do not alter the plain fact that I cannot
help--because I would not if I could. That sounds brutal; but,
unfortunately, it is true. And it is best to tell the truth, as far as
it can be told.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130129">A faint smile curved her lips. '<hi rend="italic">That</hi> is not
far. If you will wait I will tell you the truth to the bitter
end.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130130">He looked at her with sudden interest, for her pride attracted
him. She was not in the least pretty; she might be any age from
five-and-twenty to five-and-thirty; and she--well! she was a lady. But
would she tell the truth? Women, even ladies, seldom did; still he
must wait and hear what she had to say.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130131">'I sent for you,' she began, 'because, knowing you were an
adventurer, a man who had had to leave the army under a cloud--in
disgrace--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130132">He stared at her blankly. Here was the truth about himself at any
rate!</p><p xml:id="fswater_130134">'I thought, naturally, you would be a man who would take a
bribe. There are diamonds in that case; for money is scarce in this
house.' She paused, to gain firmness for what came next, 'I was
keeping them for the boy. I have a son in England and he will have to
go to school soon; but I thought it better to save his father's
reputation instead. They are fine diamonds'--she drew the case closer
and<pb xml:id="fswater_130133" n="16 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> opened it--the sunshine,
streaming in, caught the facets of the stones, turning them to liquid
light--'You needn't tell me they are no use,' she went on quickly, as
he seemed about to speak, 'I am not stupid; but that has nothing to do
with the question. I want you to save my husband--don't interrupt me,
please, for I do want you to understand, and I will tell you the
truth. You asked me why? and you think, no doubt, that he does not
deserve to be saved. Do you think I do not know that? Mr. Greyman! a
wife knows more of her husband than any one else can do; and I have
known for so many years.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130135">A sudden softness came to her hearer's eyes. That was true at any
rate. She must know many things of which she could not speak, and a
sort of horror at what she must know, with a man like Major Erlton as
her husband, held him silent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130136">'Yet I have saved him so far,' she went on, 'but if what happened
yesterday becomes public property all my trouble is in vain. He will
have to leave the regiment--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130137">'He is not the first man, as you were kind enough to mention just
now,' interrupted James Greyman, 'who has had to leave the army under
a cloud. He would survive it--as others have done.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130138">'I was not thinking of him at all,' she replied quietly, 'I was
thinking of my son; my only son.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130139">'There are other only sons also, Mrs. Erlton,' he retorted, 'I was
my mother's, but I don't think the fact was taken into consideration
by the court-martial. Why should I be more lenient? You have come to
the wrong person when you come to me for charity or consideration. None was shown to me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130140">'Perhaps because you did not need it,' she said quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130141">'Not need it--?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130142">'Many a man falls under the shadow of a cloud blamelessly. What do
they want with charity?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130144">He rose swiftly and so, facing the light again, stood looking out
into it. 'I am obliged to you,' he said after a pause. 'Whether you
are right or wrong doesn't affect the question from which we have
wandered. Except--' he turned to her again with a certain
eagerness--'Mrs. Erlton! You say you are prepared to tell the truth to
the bitter end. Then for Heaven's sake let us have it for once in our
lives. You never saw me before, nor I you. It is not likely we<pb xml:id="fswater_130143" n="17 HOME SWEET HOME"/> shall ever meet again. So we can speak
without a past or a future tense. You ask me to save your husband from
the consequences of his own cheating. I ask why? Why should I
sacrifice myself? Why should I suffer? for, mark you, there were heavy
bets--"</p><p xml:id="fswater_130145">'There are the diamonds,' she interrupted, pointing to them; their
gleam was scarcely brighter than her scornful eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130146">He gave a half-smile. 'Doubtless there are the diamonds! I can have
my equivalent, so far, if I choose; but I don't choose. It does not
suit me personally; so that is settled. I can't do this thing, then,
to please myself. Now, let us go on. You are a religious woman, I
think, Mrs. Erlton--you have the look of one. Then you will say that I
should remember my own frailty, and forgive as I would be
forgiven. Mrs. Erlton! I am no better than most men, no doubt, but I
never remember cheating at cards or pulling a horse as your husband
does--it is the brutal truth between us, remember. And if you tell me
I'm bound to protect a man from the natural punishment of a great
crime because I've stolen a pin, I say you are wrong. That theory
won't hold water. If our own faults, even our own crimes, are to make
us tender over these things in others, there must be--what, if I
remember right, my Colenso used to call an arithmetical progression in
error--until the Day of Judgment; for the odds on sin would rise with
every crime. I don't believe in mercy, Mrs. Erlton. I never
did. Justice doesn't need it. So let us leave religion alone too, and
come to other things--altruism--charity--what you will. Now, who will
benefit by my silence? Will you? You said just now that a wife knows
more of her husband than a stranger can. I well believe it. That is
why I ask you to tell me frankly, if you really think that a
continuance of the life you lead with him can benefit you?' He leant
over the table, resting his head on his hand, his eyes on hers, and
then added in a lower voice, 'The brutal truth, please. Not as woman
to man, or for the matter of that, woman to woman; but soul to soul,
if there be such a thing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130147">She turned away from him and shook her head. 'It is for the boy's
sake,' she said in muffled tones. 'It will be better for him,
surely.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130149">'The boy,' he echoed, rising with a sense of relief. She had not
lied, this woman with the beautiful eves; she had<pb xml:id="fswater_130148" n="18 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> simply shut the door in his face. 'You have a
portrait of him, no doubt, somewhere. I should like to see it. Is that
it on the mantelpiece?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130150">He walked over to a coloured photograph, and stood looking at it
silently, his hands--holding his hunting crop--clasped loosely behind
his back. Kate noticed them even in her anxiety; for they were
noticeable, nervous, fine-cut hands, matching the figure.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130151">'He is not the least like you. He is the very image of his father,'
came the verdict. 'What right have you to suppose that anything you or
I can do now will overcome the initial fact that the boy is your
husband's son, any more than it will ease you of the responsibility of
having chosen such a father for the boy?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130152">She gave a quick cry, more of pain than anger, and hid her face on
the table in sudden despair.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130153">'You are very cruel,' she said, indistinctly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130154">He walked back towards her, remorseful at the sight of her
miserable self-abasement. He had not meant to hit so hard, being
accustomed himself to facing facts without flinching.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130155">'Yes! I am cruel; but a life like mine doesn't make a man
gentle. And I don't see how this trivial concealment of fact--for that
is all it would be--can change the boy's character or help him. If I
did--' he paused, 'I should like to help you if I could, Mrs. Erlton,
if only because you--you refused me charity! But I cannot see my
way. It would do no one any good. Begin with me. I'm not a religious
man, Mrs. Erlton. I don't believe in the forgiveness of sins. So my
soul--if I have one--wouldn't benefit. As for my body? At the risk of
you offering me diamonds again,'--he smiled charmingly--'I must
mention that I should lose--how much is a detail--by concealment. So I
must go out of the question of benefit. Then there is you--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130156">He broke off to walk up and down the room thoughtfully, then to
pause before her. 'I wish you to believe,' he said, 'that I want
really to understand the truth, but I can't, because I don't know one
thing. I don't know if you love your husband--or not?"</p><p xml:id="fswater_130157">She raised her head quickly with a fear behind the resentment of
her eyes. 'Put me outside the question too. I have told you that
already. It is the simplest, the best way.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130158" n="19 HOME SWEET HOME"/><p xml:id="fswater_130159">He bowed cynically. She came no nearer to truth than evasion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130160">'If you wish it, certainly. Then there is the boy. You want to
prevent him from realising that his father is a--let us twist the
sentence--what his father is. You have, I expect, sent him away for
this purpose. So far good. But will this concealment of mine suffice?
Will no one else blab the truth? Even if concealment succeeds all
along the line, will it prevent the boy from following in his father's
steps if he has inherited his father's nature as well as his face?
Wouldn't it be a deterrent in that case to know early in life that
such instincts can't be indulged with impunity in the society of
gentlemen? You will never have the courage to keep the boy out of your
life altogether as you are doing now. Sooner or later you will bring
him back, he will bring himself back, and then, on the threshold of
life, he will have an example of successful dishonesty put before
him. Mrs. Erlton! you can't keep up the fiction always; so it is
better for you, for me, for him, to tell the truth--and I mean to tell
it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130161">She rose swiftly to her feet and faced him, thrusting her hair back
from her forehead passionately, as if to clear away aught that might
obscure her brain.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130163">'And for my husband?' she asked. 'Have you no word for him? Is he
not to be thought of at all? You asked me just now if I loved him, and
I was a coward. Well! I do not love him--more's the pity, for I can't
make up the loss of that to him anyhow. But there is enough pity in
his life without that. Can't you see it? The pity that such things
should be in life at all. You called me a religious woman just
now. I'm not, really. It is the pity of such things without a remedy
that drives me to believe, and the pity of it which drives me back
again upon myself, as you have driven me now. For you are right! Do
you think I can't see the shame? Do you think I don't know that it is
too late--that I should have thought of all this before I called my
boy's nature out of the dark? And yet--' her face grew sharp with a
pitiful eagerness, she moved forward and laid her hand on his arm--'It
is all so dark! You said just now that I couldn't keep up the fiction;
but need it be a fiction always? What do we know? God gives men a
chance sometimes. He gives the whole world a chance sometimes of
atoning for many sins. A Spirit moves on the<pb xml:id="fswater_130162" n="20 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Waters of life bringing something to cleanse and
heal. It may be moving now. Give my husband his chance, Mr. Greyman,
and I will pray that, whatever it is, it may come quickly.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130164">He had listened with startled eyes; now his hand closed on hers in
swift negation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130165">'Don't pray for that,' he said, in a quick low voice, 'it may come
too soon for some of us, God knows--too soon for many a good man and
true!' Then, as if vexed at his own outburst, he drew back a step,
looking at her with a certain resentment.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130166">'You plead your cause well, Mrs. Erlton, and it is a stronger
argument than you perhaps guess. So let him have this chance that is
coming. Let us all have it, you and I into the bargain. No! don't be
grateful, please, for he may prove himself a coward, amongst other
things. So may I, for that matter. One never knows until the chance
comes for being a hero--or the other thing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130167">'When the chance comes we shall see,' she said, trying to match his
light tone. 'Till then, good-bye--you have been very kind.' She held
out her hand but he did not take it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130168">'Pardon me! I have been very rude, and you--' he paused in his
half-jesting words, stooped over her outstretched hand and kissed
it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130169">Kate stood looking at the hand with a slight frown after his
horse's hoofs died away; and then with a smile she shut the jewel
case. Not that she closed the incident also; for full half-an-hour
later she was still going over all the details of the past interview;
and everything in it seemed to hinge on that unforeseen appeal of hers
for a chance of atonement, on that unpremeditated, strange suggestion
that a Spirit might even then be moving on the face of the Waters;
until, in that room, gay with English flowers, and peaceful utterly in
its air of security, a terror seized on her, body and soul. A
causeless terror, making her strain eyes and ears as if for a hint of
what was to come and make cowards or heroes of them all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130170">But there was only the flowerful garden beyond the arched verandah,
only the soft gurgle of the doves. Yet she sat with quivering nerves
till the sight of the gardener coming as usual with his watering pot
made her smile at the unfounded tragedy of her imaginings.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130172">As she passed into the verandah she called to him, in the<pb xml:id="fswater_130171" n="21 HOME SWEET HOME"/> jargon which served for her orders, not
to forget a plentiful supply to the heartsease and the sweet peas; for
she loved her poor clumps of English annuals more than all the scented
and blossoming shrubs which, in those late March days, turned the
garden into a wilderness of strange perfumed beauty. Her cult of home
was a religion with her; and if a visitor remarked that anything in
her environment was reminiscent of the old country, she rejoiced to
have given another exile what was to her as the shadow of a rock in a
thirsty land.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130173">So, her eye catching something barely up to western mark in the
pattern of a collar her tailor was cutting for her new dress, she
crossed over to where he squatted in the further corner of the
verandah.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130174">'That isn't right. Give me something to cut--here! this will
do.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130175">She drew a broadsheet of native paper from the bundle of scraps
beside him, and began on it with the scissors, too full of her idea to
notice the faint negation of the man's hand. 'There!' she said after a
few deft snippings, 'that is new fashion.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130176">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor!</hi>' assented the tailor submissively
as, apparently from tidiness, he put away the remainder of the paper,
before laying the new-cut pattern on the cloth.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130177">His mistress looked down at it critically. There was a broad line
of black curves and square, dots right across the pattern suggestive
of its having been cut from a title-page. But to her ignorance of the
Persian character they were nothing but curves and dots, though the
tailor's eyes read clearly in them 'The Sword is the Key of Heaven.'
For he, in company with thousands of other men, had been reading the
famous pamphlet of that name; reading it with that thrill of the
heart-strings which has been the prelude to half the discords and
harmonies of history. Since, quaintly enough, those who may hope to
share your heaven are always friends, those who can with certainty be
consigned to hell, your enemies.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130178">'That is all right,' she said. 'Cut it well on the bias, so that it
won't pucker.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130180">As she turned away, she felt the vast relief of being able to think
of such trivialities again after the strain and stress of the hours
since her husband had come home from the race-<pb xml:id="fswater_130179" n="22 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>course, full of excited maledictions on the mean,
underhand bribery and spying which might make it necessary for him to
send in his papers--if he could. Kate had heard stories of a similar
character before; since Major Erlton knew by experience that she had
his reputation more at heart than he had himself, and that her brain
was clearer, her tact greater than his. But she had never heard one so
hopeless. Unless this jockey Greyman, who, her husband said, was so
mixed up with native intrigue as to have any amount of false evidence
at his command, could be silenced, her labour of years was ruined. So,
long after her husband had gone off to his bed to sleep soundly,
heavily, after the manner of men, Kate had lain awake in hers after
the manner of women, resolving to risk all, even to a certain extent
honesty, in order to silence this man, this adventurer--who no doubt
was not one whit better than her husband.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130181">And now? As her mind flashed back over that interview the one thing
that stood out above all others was the bearing, the deference of the
man as he had stooped to kiss her hand. For the life of her, she--who
protested even to herself that such things had no part in her
life--could not help a joy in the remembrance; a quick recognition
that here was a man who could put romance into a woman's life. The
thought was one, however, from which to escape by the first
distraction at hand. This happened to be the cockatoo, which, after a
bath and plentiful food, looked a different bird on its new perch.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130182">'Pretty, pretty poll,' she said hastily with tentative white finger
tickling its crest. The bird, in high good humour, bent its head
sideways and chuckled inarticulately; yet to an accustomed ear the
sound held the cadence of the Great Cry, and the tailor, who had heard
it given wrathfully, looked up from his work.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130183">'O Miffis Erlton!' what a boo'ful new polly,' came a silvery
lisp. She turned with a radiant smile to greet her next door
neighbour's little boy, a child of about three years old, who,
pathetically enough, was a great solace to her child-bereft life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130184">'Yes, Sonny, isn't it lovely?' she said, her slim white hand going
out to bring the child closer; 'and it screams splendidly. Would you
like to hear it scream ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130186">Sonny, clinging tightly to her fingers, looked doubtful.<pb xml:id="fswater_130185" n="23 HOME SWEET HOME"/> 'Wait till muv'ver comth, muv'ver's
comin' to zoo esectly. Sonny's always flightened wizout hith
muvver.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130187">At which piece of diplomacy, Kate, feeling light-hearted, caught
the little white-clad golden-curled figure in her arms and ran out
with it into the garden smothering the laughing face with kisses as
she ran.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130188">'Sonny's a little goose to be "flightened,"' came her glad voice
between the laughs and the kisses. 'He ought never to be "flightened"
at all, because no one in all the wide, wide world would ever hurt a
good little childie like Sonnykins--No one! No one! No one!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130189">She had set the little fellow down among the flowers by this time,
being in good sooth breathless with his weight; and now, continuing
the game, chased him with pretence booings of 'No one! No one!' about
the pansy bed and so round the sweet peas; until, in delicious terror,
he shrieked with delight, and chased her back between her
chasings.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130190">It was a pretty sight, indeed, this game between the woman and the
child. The gardener paused in his watering, the tailor at his work;
and even the native orderly going his rounds with the brigade
order-book grinned broadly, so adding one to the kindly dark faces
watching the chasing of Sonny.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130191">'My dear Kate! How can you?' The querulous voice broke in on the
booings, and made Mrs. Erlton pause and think of her loosened
hair-pins. The speaker was a fair diaphanous woman, the most
solid-looking part of whose figure, as she dawdled up the path, was
the large white umbrella she carried. 'Here am I melting with the
heat! What I shall do next year if George is transferred to Delhi, I
don't know. He says we shan't be able to afford the hills. And he has
the dogcart at some of those eternal court-martials. I wonder why the
sepoys give so much trouble now-a-days. George says they're spoilt. So
I came to see if you'd drive me to the band; though I'm not fit to be
seen. I was up half the night with baby. She is so cross, and George
will have it she must be ill; as if children didn't have tempers!
Lucky you, to have your boy at home; and yet you go romping with other
people's. I wouldn't; but then I look horrid when I'm hot.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130193">Kate laughed. She did not, and as she rearranged her hair seemed to
have left years of life behind her, 'I can't<pb xml:id="fswater_130192" n="24 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> help it,' she said. 'I feel so ridiculously young
myself sometimes--as if I hadn't lived at all, as if nothing belonged
to me, and I was really somebody else. As if--' She paused abruptly in
her confidences, and, to change the subject, turned to the group
behind Mrs. Seymour. It consisted of an ayah holding a toddler by the
hand, and a tall orderly in uniform carrying a year-old baby in his
arms--such a languid little mortal as is seldom seen out of India,
where the swift, sharp fever of the changing seasons seems to take the
very life from a child in a few hours. The fluffy golden head in its
limp white sun-bonnet rested inert against the orderly's scarlet
coatee, the listless little legs drooped helplessly among the
burnished belts and buckles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130194">'Poor little chick! Let me have her a bit, orderly,' said Kate,
laying her hand caressingly on the slack dimpled arm; but baby, with a
fretful whine, nestled her cheek closer into the scarlet. A shade of
satisfaction made its owner's dark face less impassive, and the small,
sinewy, dark hands held their white burden a shade tighter.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130195">'She is so cross,' complained the mother. 'It has been so all
day. She won't leave the man for an instant. He must be sick of her,
though he doesn't show it. And she used to go to the ayah; but do you
know, Kate, I don't trust the woman a bit. I believe she gives opium
to the child, so that she may get a little rest.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130196">Kate looked at the ayah's face with a sudden doubt. 'I don't know,'
she said slowly. 'I think they believe it is a good thing. I remember
when Freddy was a baby--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130197">'Oh I don't believe they ever think that sort of thing,'
interrupted Mrs. Seymour. 'You never can trust the natives you
know. That's the worse of India. Oh! how' I wish I was back in dear
old England with a real nurse who would take the children off my
hands.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130198">But Kate Erlton was following up her own doubt. 'The children trust
them--' she began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130199">'My dear Kate! you can't trust children either. Look at Baby! It
gives me the shudders to think of touching Bij-rao, and see how she
cuddles up to him,' replied Mrs. Seymour, as she dawdled on to the
house. Then, seeing the bed of heartsease, she paused to go into
raptures over them; they were like English ones, she said.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130201">The puzzled look left Kate's face. 'I sent some home last<pb xml:id="fswater_130200" n="25 THE GREAT GULF FIXED"/> mail,' she replied in a sort of
hushed voice 'just to show them that we were not cut off from
everything we care for--not everything.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130202">So, as if by one accord, these two Englishwomen raised their eyes
from the pansy bed, and passing by the flowering shrubs, the
encircling tamarind trees framing the cosy homelike house, rested them
on the reddening gold of the western sky. Its glow lay on their faces,
making them radiant.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130203">But baby's heavy lids had fallen at last over her heavy eyes as she
lay in the orderly's arms, and he glanced at the ayah with a certain
pride in his superior skill as a nurse.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0103" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III<lb/>THE GREAT GULF FIXED</head><p xml:id="fswater_130204">IT was a quaint house in the oldest quarter of the city of Lucknow,
where odd little groves linger between the alleys, so that men pass,
at a step, from evil-smelling lanes to cool, scented retreats, dark
with orange and mango-trees; where birds flutter, and squirrels loll
yawning through the summer days, as if the great town were miles
away.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130206">It was in the furthest corner of such a flowerless shady garden
that the house reared its lessening storeys and projecting eaves above
its neighbours. The upper half of it was not unlike an Italian villa
in its airiness, its balustraded roof, its green jalousies; but the
lower portion was unmistakably Indian. It was a perfect rabbit warren
of dark cells, crushed in on each other causelessly; the very
staircase, though but two feet wide, having to fold itself away
circumspectly so as to find space to creep upwards. But no one lived
below, and the dark twists and turns of the brick ladder mattered
little to Zora-<hi rend="italic">bibi</hi> who lived in the pleasant
pavilions above; for she had scarcely ever left them since the day,
nearly eight years past, when James Greyman had installed her there
with all the honour possible to the situation. Which was, briefly,
that he had bought the slip of a girl from a house of ill-fame, as he
would have bought a horse, or a flower-pot, or anything else which he
thought would make life pleasanter to him. He had paid a long
price<pb xml:id="fswater_130205" n="26 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> for her, not only
because she was beautiful, but because he pitied the delicate-looking
child--for she was little more--just about to enter a profession to
which she was evidently a recruit kidnapped in early infancy; as so
many are in India. Not that his pity would have led him to buy her if
she had been ugly, or even dark; for the creamy ivory tint of her skin
satisfied his fastidiousness quite as much as did the hint of a soul
in her dark dreamy eyes. Romance had perhaps had more to do with his
purchase than passion; restless, reckless determination to show
himself that he had no regrets for the society which had dispensed
with his, had had more than either. For he had began to rent the
pleasant pavilions after a few years of adventurous roving had
emphasised the gulf fixed between him and his previous life, and
forced his pride into leading his present one as happily as he
could.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130207">As for the girl, those eight years of pure passion on the
house-tops had been a dream of absolute content. It was so even now
when she lay dying, as so many secluded women do, of a slow
decline. To have flowers and fruit brought to her, to find no change
in his tenderness because she was too languid to amuse him, to have
him wait upon her and kiss away her protests; all this made her soft
warm eyes softer, warmer. It was so unlike anything she had ever heard
or dreamt of; it made her blind to the truth, that she was dying. How
could this be so when there was no hint of change, when life still
gave her all she cared for? She did not, to be sure, play tricks with
him like a kitten, as she used to; but that was because she was
growing old--nearly one and twenty!</p><p xml:id="fswater_130209">'She is worse to-day. I deem her close to freedom, Soma, so I have
warmed the death-tender,' said a tall woman, as she straightened the
long column of her throat to the burden of a brass water-pot,
new-poised on her head, and stepped down from the low parapet of the
well which stood in one corner of the shady grove. Sometimes its
creaking Persian wheel moaned over the task of sending runnels of
water to the thirsty trees; but to-day it was silent, save for an
intermittent protest when the man--who was lazily leaning his back
against the yoke--put out his strength so as to empty an extra
water-can or two into the trough for the woman's use. He was in the
undress uniform of a sepoy, and as he also straightened himself to
face the speaker, the extraordinary<pb xml:id="fswater_130208" n="27 THE GREAT GULF FIXED"/> likeness between them in face and figure stamped them as
twins. It would have been difficult to give the palm to either for
superior height or beauty; and in their perfection of form they might
have stood as models of the mythical race-founders whose names they
bore. For Tara Devi and Soma Chund were Rajpoots of the single Lunar
or Yadubansi tribe. She was dressed in an endless scarf of crimson
wool, which with its border of white and yellow embroidery hung about
her in admirable folds. The gleam of the water-pot matched the dead
gold circlets on the brown wrists and ankles; for Tara wore her
savings thus, though she had no right to do so, being a widow. But she
had been eight years in James Greyman's service; and for more than
eight she had been bound to him by the strangest of ties. He had been
the means of saving her from her husband's funeral pyre; in other
words of preventing her from being a saint, of making her outcaste
utterly, Since none, not even other widows, would eat or drink with a
woman rejected by the very gods on the threshold of Paradise. Such a
mental position is well-nigh incomprehensible to Western minds. It was
confusing, even to Tara herself; and the mingling of conscious dignity
and conscious degradation, gratitude, resentment, attraction,
repulsion, made her a puzzle even to herself at times.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130210">'The master will grieve,' replied Soma; his voice was far softer
than his sister's had been, but it had the effect of hardening hers
still more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130211">'What then?' she asked; 'man's sorrow for a woman passes; or even
if it pass not, bears no fruit here, or hereafter. But I, as <hi rend="italic">thou knowest, Soma</hi>, would have burnt with my
love. <hi rend="italic">But for thee</hi>, as thou knowest, I would
have been <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi>
virtuous). <hi rend="italic">But for thee</hi> I should have found,
ay! and given salvation.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130213">She passed on with a sweep of full drapery, bearing her water-pot
as a queen might her crown, leaving Soma's handsome face full of
conscience-stricken amaze. His sister--from whom, despite her
degradation, he had not been able to dissociate himself utterly--had
never before rounded on him for his share in her misfortune; but in
his heart of hearts he had admitted his responsibility at one moment,
scorned it the next. True, he had told his young lieutenant that his
brother-in-law was going to be burnt, as an excuse for not
accompanying him after black-buck one morning; but who
<pb xml:id="fswater_130212" n="28 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> would have dreamt that this commonplace
remark would rouse the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> curiosity to
see the obsequies of a high caste Rajpoot, and so lead, incidentally,
to a file of policemen and the neighbouring magistrate dragging the
sixteen-year old widow from the very flames?--when she was drugged,
too, and quite happy--when the wrench was over, even for him, and she,
to all intents, was a saint scattering salvation on seven generations
of inconstant males! Much as he loved Tara, the little twin sister
who, so the village gossips used to tell, had left the Darkness for
the Light of Life still clasping his hand, how could he have done her
such an injury? As a Rajpoot how could he have brought such a
scandalous dishonour on any family?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130214">But being also a soldier, as his fathers had been before him, and
so leavened unconsciously by much contact wit Europeans, he could not
help admiring Tara's pluck in refusing to accept the life of a dog
which was all that was left to her among her own people. And he had
been grateful to the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, as she was, for
giving her good service where he could see her; though he would not
for worlds have touched the hand which had lain in his from the
beginning of all things. It was unclean now.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130215">Still he could not forget the gossip's story any more than he could
forget that James Greyman had been his lieutenant, and that together
they had shot over half Hurreeana. So when he passed through Lucknow
on his way to spend his leave in his wife's village, he always gave a
day or two of it to the quaint garden-house.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130216">And now Tara had definitely accused him of ruining her life! Anger,
born of a vague remorse, filled him as he watched her disappear up the
plinth. If it was anybody's fault it was the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi>; or rather of the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi> itself who by high-handed interference with
venerable customs, made it possible for a poor man, by a mere slip of
the tongue, to injure one bound to him by the closest of ties.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130218">'It will leave us naught to ourselves soon,' he muttered sulkily as
he went out to the doorstep to finish polishing the master's sword;
that being a recognised office during these occasional visits, which,
as it occurred to him in his discontent, would be still more
occasional if among other things the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi>,
now that Oude was annexed, took away the extra leave due to foreign
service. They had said so in the regiment; and<pb xml:id="fswater_130217" n="29 THE GREAT GULF FIXED"/> though he was too tough to feel pin-pricks in advance,
he had sneered with others in the current jest that the maps were
tinted red--<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> shown to be British
territory--by savings stolen from the sepoy's pocket.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130219">It was very quiet on the paved slope leading up from the alley to
the carved door beyond the gutter. The lane was too narrow for wheeled
traffic, the evening not sufficiently advanced for the neighbours to
gather in it for gossip. But every now and again a veiled figure would
sidle along the further wall, passing good-looking Soma with a
flurried shuffle. Whereat, though he knew these ghostly figures to be
old women on their way to market, he cocked his turban more awry, and
curled his mustachios nearer his eyes; from no set purpose of playing
the gay Lothario, but for the honour of the regiment, and because War
and Women go together, East and West.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130220">After a time, however, the workmen began to dawdle past from their
work, and some of them, remembering Soma, paused to ask him the latest
news--a stranger in a native city being equivalent to an evening
paper. And, of course, there were questions as to what the regiment
thought of this and that. But Soma's replies were curt. He never
relished being lumped in as a simple Rajpoot with the rest of the
Rajpoots, for he was inordinately proud of his tribe. That was one
reason why he stood aloof, as he did, from much that went on among his
comrades. He drilled, it is true, between two of them who were entered
as he was--that is to say, as a Rajpoot--on the roster; but the three
were, in reality, as wide apart as the Sun, the Moon, and the Fire
from which they respectively claimed descent. They would not have
intermarried into each other's families for all the world and its
wealth: a causeless differentiation which makes, and must make, a
people who cling to it incomprehensible to a race which boasts, as a
check to pride or an encouragment to humility, that all men are born
of Adam, and which seeks no hall-mark for its descendants save the
stamp of the almighty dollar.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130222">Soma, therefore, polishing his master's sword sulkily, grew
irritable also; especially when the frequenters of the opium and hemp
shops began, with wavering steps and lack-lustre eyes, to loaf
homewards for the evening meal which would give them strength for
another dose. There were many such<pb xml:id="fswater_130221" n="30 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> habitual drug-takers in the quarter; for it was largely
inhabited by poor claimants to nobility who, having nothing to do, had
time for dreams. That was why people from other quarters flocked to
this one at sundown for gossip; since it is to be had at its best from
the opium-eater, whose imagination is stimulated, his reason dulled,
beyond the power of discrimating even his own truth or falsehood. One
of these, a haggard, sallow fellow in torn muslin and ragged
embroidery, stopped with a heavy-lidded leer beside Soma.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130223">'So, brother, back again!' he said with the maudlin gravity of a
hemp-smoker; 'and thou lookest fat. The bone-dust must agree with
thee.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130224">It was if a bomb had fallen. The Hindoo bystanders, recognising the
rumour that ground bones were mixed with Commissariat flour, drew back
from the Rajpoot instinctively the Mohamedans smiled on the sly. Soma
himself had in a moment one sinewy hand on the half-drunk creature's
throat, the other brandishing the fresh-polished sword.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130225">'Bone-dust thyself, and pigs-meat too, foul-mouthed slayer of
sacred kine!' he gasped, carrying the war into the enemy's
country. 'Thou beast! Unsay the lie!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130226">His indignation, showing that he appreciated the credence some
might be disposed to give to the accusation, only made the Hindoos
look at each other. The Mohamedans, however, dragged him from the
swaying figure of the accuser, who, after all, was one of
themselves.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130227">'Heed him not!' they chorussed appeasingly. ''Tis drug-shop talk,
and every sane man knows that for dreams. Lo! his sense is clean gone
as horns from a donkey! Sure, thy mother eat chillies in her time for
thou to be so hotblooded. It is not morning, brother, because a hen
crows, and a snake is but a snake, and goes crooked even to his own
home!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130228">These hoarded saws, with physical force superadded, left Soma
reduced to glaring and renewed claims for a retraction of the
insult.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130230">The hemp-smoker looked at him mournfully. 'Would'st have me deny
God's truth?' he hiccupped. 'Lo! I say not thou did'st eat it. Thou
say'st not, and who am I to decide between a man and his stomach, even
though he looks fat? Yet this all know, that as a bird fattens his
tail shrinks, and honour is nowhere nowadays. But this I say for
certain.<pb xml:id="fswater_130229" n="31 THE GREAT GULF FIXED"/> Let him eat who will,
there is bone-dust in the flour--there is bone-dust in the
flour--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130231">He lurched from a supporter's hold and drifted down the lane,
half-chanting the words.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130232">Soma glared, now, at those doubtful faces which remained. ''Tis a
lie, brothers! But there, 'tis no use wearing the red coat now-a-days
when all scoff at it. And why not? when the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi> itself mocks our rights. I tell thee at the
father-in-law's village, but now, a man who titled me <hi rend="italic">Sahib</hi> last year puffed his smoke in my face
this. And wherefore not? May not every scoundrel nowadays drag us to
court and set us a-bribing underlings as the common herd have to do?
We, soldiers of Oude, who had a Resident of our own always, and--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130233">'Nothing lasts for always, save God,' said a long-bearded
bystander, interrupting Soma's parrot-roll of military grievances. 'As
the Moulvie said last night at our mosque, it is well He remains ever
the same, giving the same plain orders once and for all. So none of
the faithful can mistake. God is Might and Right. All the rest is
change.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130234">'<hi rend="italic">Wah! wah!</hi>' murmured some respectfully; but
the Rajpoot's scowl lost its fierceness in supercilious
indifference.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130235">'That may suit the Moulvie. It may suit thee and thine, <hi rend="italic">syyed jee</hi>' he replied, with a shrug of the
shoulders. 'It suits not me nor mine, being of a different race. We
are Rajpoots, and there is no change possible to that. We are ever the
same.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130236">The pride in his voice and manner reflected but faintly the
inconceivable pride in his heart. Yet he was on the alert, salaaming
cheerfully, as James Greyman came riding with a clatter down the
alley, and without drawing bridle, passed through the low gateway into
the dark garden heavy with the perfume of orange-blossom. His arrival
ended the incident, for Soma followed him quickly, and in obedience to
his curt order to see the groom rub down the horse while it waited as
it had been a breather round the race-course, walked off with it
towards the well. It was such an opportunity for ordering other men
about as natives dearly love; so that the more autocratic a master is,
the better pleased they are to gain dignity by serving him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130239">James Greyman, meanwhile, had paused on the plinth to give a low
whistle and look upwards to the terraced roof.<pb xml:id="fswater_130237" n="32 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> And as he did so his face was full of weariness,
and yet of impatience. He had been telling himself that he was a fool
ever since he had left Kate Erlton's drawing-room half-an-hour before,
and even his mad gallop round the steeple-chase course had not effaced
the curious sense of compulsion which had made him promise to let her
husband go scot-free. Even now, when he waited with that dread at his
heart--which of late had been growing stronger day by day--for the
answer which Zora loved to make to his signal, his fear lest the Great
Silence had fallen between them was lost in the recollection that, if
it were so, his freedom had come too late. He hated himself for thus
bracketting death and freedom together, but for all that he would not
blind himself to its truth. Now that his profession had gone with the
King's exile, Zora was, indeed, the only tie to a life which had grown
distasteful to him; and when the Great Silence came, as come it must,
he had made up his mind to leave James Greyman behind, and go home to
England. He was nearing forty, and though the spirit of reckless
adventure was fading, the ambitions of his youth seemed to be
returning--as they so often do when the burden and heat of passion
passes. He was tired of perpetual sunshine. The thought of the cold
mists on the hill tops, the wild storms on the west coast, haunted
him. He wanted to see them again. Above all, he wanted to hear himself
called by his own familiar name, not by the one he had assumed. It had
seemed brutal to dream of all this sometimes, while little Zora still
lay in his arms smiling contentedly; but it was inevitable. And so,
while he waited, watching with the dread growing at his heart for the
flutter of the tinsel veil, the half-heard whisper '<hi rend="italic">Khush amud-eed</hi>' (welcome), it was inevitable also
that the remembrance of his promise to Kate Erlton should invade, and
as it were desecrate, his real regret for the silence that seemed to
grow deeper every second. It had come too late--too late! There could
be no solace in freedom now. That other silence in regard to Major
Erlton's misdeeds meant the loss of every penny he had scraped
together for England. He might have to sell up almost everything he
possessed in order to pay his racing bets honourably; and that he must
do, or he gave away his only hope of recouping his bad luck. Why had
he promised? Why had he given up a certainty for that vague chance of
which he had spoken, he scarcely knew why, to these cold blue Northern
eyes with<pb xml:id="fswater_130238" n="33 THE GREAT GULF FIXED"/> the glint of steel. The
remembrance brought a passionate anger at himself. Was there anything
in the world worth thinking of now, with that silence new-fallen upon
him, except the soft warm eyes which were perhaps closed for ever? So,
with a quick step, he passed up the stairs and gave his signal knock
at the door which led on to the terraced roof.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130240">Tara, opening it, answered his look with finger to her lip, and a
warning glance to the low string-bed set close to the arches of the
summer-house so as to catch the soft-scented breeze. He stepped over
to it lightly and looked down on the sleeper; but the relief passed
from his face at what he saw there. It could only be a question of
hours now.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130241">'Why did'st not send before?' he asked in a low voice. 'I bid thee
send if she were worse and she needed me.' Once more the anger against
that other woman came uppermost. What was she to him that she should
filch even half-an-hour from this one who loved him? He might so
easily have come earlier--and then the promise would not have been
made! Was he utterly heartless, that this thought would come again and
again?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130242">'She slept,' replied Tara coldly. 'And sleep needs naught. Not even
Love's kisses. It is nigh the end though, master, as thou seest; so I
have warned mother Jewuni the deathtender.' She had spoken so far as
if she desired to make him wince; now the pain on his face made her
add hurriedly: 'She hath not suffered, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>,
she hath not complained. Had it been so I would have sent. But sleep
is rest.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130243">She passed on to a lower roof softening her echoing steps with a
quaint crooning lullaby:
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>'My breast is rest</l><l>And rest is Death.</l><l>Ye who have breath</l><l>Say which is best?</l><l>Death's Sleep is rest!'</l></lg></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_130245">Was it so? As he stood, still looking down on the sleeper,
something in the lack of comfort, of all the refinements and luxuries
which seem to belong by right to the sickness of dear ones in the
West, smote him suddenly with a sense of deprivation, of division. And
though he told himself that Death came in far more friendly fashion
out there in the sunlight, where you could hear the birds, watch the
squirrels, and see<pb xml:id="fswater_130244" n="34 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> the
children's kites go sailing overhead in the blue sky; still the
bareness of it seemed somehow to reveal the great gulf between his
complexity, his endless needs and desires, and the simplicity of that
human creature drifting to death, almost as the animals drift, without
complaint, without fears, or hopes. It seemed so pitiful. The slender
figure, still gay in tinsel and bright draperies, all cuddled up on
the quilt, its oval face resting hardly on the thin arm where the
bracelets hung so loosely, had an uncared-for look. It seemed alone,
apart; as far from Death in its nearness to Life, as it was from Life
in its closeness to Death. In swift pity he stooped to risk an
awakening by gathering it into his warm friendly arms--it would at
least feel the beating of another human heart when it lay there--it
would at least be more comfortable than on the bare, hard, pillowless
bed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130246">But he paused. How could he judge? How dare he judge even for that
wasted body, which, despite its softness, had never known half the
luxuries his claimed? So he left her lying as he had so often seen her
sleep, all curled up on herself like a tired squirrel, and passing to
the parapet leant over it looking moodily down into the darkening
orange-trees. Their heavy perfume floated upwards reminding him of
many another night in spring time spent with Zora upon this terraced
roof.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130247">And suddenly his hand fell heavily in a gesture of sheer anger.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130248">Before God! it had been unfair--this idyll on the housetops. The
world had held no more for her save her passion for him, pure in its
very perfection. His for her had been but a small part of his life. It
never was more than that to a man, in reality, and so this sort of
thing must always be unfair. That she had been content made it worse,
not better. Poor little soul! drifting away from the glow and the
glamour.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130249">A resentment for her, more than for himself, made him go to where
Tara sat gossiping with her fellow-servant on the other roof and bid
them wait downstairs. If the silence were indeed about to fall, if the
glow and the glamour were going, then she and he might at least be
alone once more beneath the coming stars; alone in the soft scented
darkness which had so often seemed to clasp them closer to each other
as they sat in it like a couple of children whispering over a
secret.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130251">Closer! As he leant over the parapet his keen eyes stared<pb xml:id="fswater_130250" n="35 THE GREAT GULF FIXED"/> down into the half-seen city
spreading below him. Wide, tree-set, full of faint sounds of life; the
wreaths of smoke from thousands of hearths rising to obscure it from
his view; obscuring it hopelessly with their tale of a life utterly
apart from any he could lead. Even there on the housetop he had only
pretended to lead it. It was not she, drifting to death so
contentedly, who was alone! It was he. Yet some men he had known had
seemed able to combine the two lives. They had been content to think
half-caste thoughts, to rear up a tribe of half-caste children; while
he? How many years was it since he had seen Zora weeping over a still
little morsel of humanity, his child and hers, that lay in her
tinselled veil? She had wept, mostly because she was afraid he might
be angry because his son had never drawn breath, and he had comforted
her. He had never told her of the relief it was to him, of the vague
repulsion which the thought of a child had always brought with it. One
could not help these things; and, after all, she had only cared
because she was afraid he cared. She did not crave for motherhood
either. It was the glow and the glamour that had been the bond between
them--nothing else. And, thank Heaven! she had never tired of it,
would never see him tire of it--since Death would come before that
now.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130252">A chiming clash of silver made him turn quickly. She had awakened,
and seeing him by the parapet, had set her small feet to the ground,
and now stood trying to steady herself by her thin, wide-spread
arms.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130253">'Zora! wait! I am coming,' he cried, starting forward. Then he
paused, speech and action arrested by something in her look, her
gesture.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130254">'Let me come,' she murmured, her breath gone with the effort. 'I
can come. I must be able to come. My lord is so near--so near.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130255">A fierce pity made him stand still. 'Surely thou canst come,' he
answered. 'I will stay here.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130256">As she stood, with parted lips, waiting for a glint of strength ere
she tried to walk, her swaying figure, the brilliance of her eyes, the
heaving of her delicate throat, cut him to the very heart for her sake
more than for his own. Then the jingle of her silver anklets rose
again in irregular cadence, to cease at the next pillar where she
paused, steadying herself against the cold stone to regain her
breath.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130257" n="36 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130258">'Surely, I can come; and he so near,' she murmured wistfully, half
to herself.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130259">'Thou art in too great a hurry, sweetheart. There is plenty of
time. The stars are barely lit, and star-time is ever our time.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130260">He set his teeth over the words; but the glow and the glamour
should not fail her yet. He would take her back with him, while he
could, to the past which had been so full of it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130261">'Come slower, my bird, I am waiting,' he said again as the jingling
cadence ceased once more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130262">'It is so strange,' she gasped; 'I feel so strange.' And even in
the dim light he could see a vague terror, a pitifu amaze in her
face. That must not be. That must be stopped. 'And it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> strange,' he answered quickly. 'Strange, indeed,
for me to wait like a king, when thou art my queen!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130263">A faint smile drove the wonder away, a faint laugh mingled with the
chiming and clashing. She was like a wounded bird, he thought, as he
watched her; a wounded bird fluttering to find shelter from death.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130264">'Take care! Take care of the step!' he cried, as a stumble made him
start forward; but when she recovered herself blindly he stood still
once more, waiting. Let her come if she could. Let her keep the
glamour.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130265">Keep it! She had done more than that. She had given it back to him
at its fullest, as, close at hand, he saw her radiant face, and his
outstretched hands met hers warm and clasping. The touch of them made
him forget all else, he drew her close to him passionately. She gave a
smiling sob of sheer content, raising her face to meet his kisses.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130266">'I have come,' she whispered. 'I have come to my king.' Her voice
ended like a sigh. Then there was silence, a fainte sigh, then silence
again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130267">'Zora!' he called with a sudden dread at his heart. 'What is
it--Zora! Zora!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130268">Half-an-hour afterwards, Tara-Devi obeying her master' summons,
found him standing beside the bed, which he had dragged out under the
stars, and flung up her arms to give the wail for what she saw
there.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130269">'Hush!' he said sternly, clutching at her shoulder. 'I will not
have her disturbed.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130271">Tara looked at him wonderingly. 'There is no fear of<pb xml:id="fswater_130270" n="37 TAPE AND SEALING-WAX"/> that,' she replied clearly, loudly, 'None
shall disturb Zora again. She hath found <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
freedom in the future. For the rest of us, God knows! The times are
strange. So let her have her right of wailing, master. She will feel
silent in the grave without the voices of her race.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130272">He drew his hand away sharply; even in death a great gulf lay
between him and the woman he had loved.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130273">So the death wail rang out clamourously through the soft dark
air.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0104" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV<lb/>TAPE AND SEALING-WAX</head><p xml:id="fswater_130274">'I CAN'T think,' said a good-looking middle-aged man as he
petulantly pushed aside a pile of official papers, 'where Dashe picks
these things up. I never come across them. And it is not as if he were
in a big station or--or in the swim in any way.' He spoke fretfully,
as one might who, having done his best, has failed. And he had grounds
for this feeling, since the fact that the diffident district-officer
named Dashe was not in the swim, must clearly have been due to his
official superiors; the speaker being one of them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130275">Fortunately however for England, these diffident sons of hers
cannot always hide their lights under bushels. As the biographies of
many Indian statesmen show, some outsider notices a gleam of
common-sense amid the gloom, and steers his course by it. Now
Mr. Dashe's intimate knowledge of a certain jungle tract in his
district, had resulted in a certain military magnate bagging three
tigers. From this, to a reliance on his political perceptions is not
so great a jump as might appear; since a man acquainted with the haunt
of every wild beast in his jurisdiction, may be credited with
knowledge of other dangerous inhabitants. So much so that the military
magnate being impressed by some casual remarks, had asked Mr. Dashe to
put down his views on paper, and had passed them on to a great
political light.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130277">It was he who sat at the table looking at a broadsheet printed in
the native character, as if it were a personal affront. The military
magnate, who had come over to discuss the question, was lounging in an
easy-chair with a<pb xml:id="fswater_130276" n="38 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
cheroot. They were both excellent specimens of Englishmen. The
civilian a trifle bald, the soldier a trifle grey; but one glance was
sufficient to judge them neither knaves nor fools.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130278">'That's the proclamation you're at now, isn't it? asked the
military magnate looking up, 'I'm afraid I could only make out a word
here and there. That's the worst of Dashe. He's so deuced clever at
the vernaculars himself that he imagines other people--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130279">The political, who had earned his first elevation from the common
herd to the Secretariat by a nice taste in Persian couplets suitable
for <hi rend="italic">durbar</hi> speeches, smiled
compassionately;</p><p xml:id="fswater_130280">'My dear sir! This is not even <hi rend="italic">shikust</hi>
(broken character). It is lithoraphed, and plain sailing to any one
not a fool--I mean to any one on the civil side, of course--you
soldiers have not to learn the language. But I have a translation
here. As this farrago of Dashe's must go to Calcutta in due course, I
had one made for the Governor-General's use.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130281">He handed a paper across the table, and then turned to the next
paragraph of the jeremiad.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130283">The military magnate laid down his cigar, took up the document, and
glanced at it apprehensively; resumed his cigar, and settled himself
in his chair. It was a very comfortable one and matched the
office-room, which, being in the political light's private house, was
under the supervision of his wife, who was a notable woman. Her
portrait stood in the place of honour on the mantelpiece and it was
flanked by texts; one inculcating the virtue of doing as you would be
done by, the other the duty of doing good without ceasing. Both rather
dangerous maxims, when you have to deal with a different personal and
ethical standard of happiness and righteousness. There was also a
semicircle of children's photographs--of the kind known as
positives--on the table round the official ink-pot. When the sun shone
on their glasses, as it did now through a western window, they dazzled
the eyes. May be it was their hypnotising influence, which inclined
the father of the family towards treating every problem which came to
that office-table, as if the first desideratum was their welfare,
their approbation; not, of course, as his children, but as the
representative Englishmen and women of the future. Yet he was
fulfilled with earnest desires to do his duty by those over whom he
had been set to rule, and as he read, his sense of responsi<pb xml:id="fswater_130282" n="39 TAPE AND SEALING-WAX"/>bility was simply portentous, and his
pen, scratching fluently in comments over the half margin, was full of
wisdom. This sound was the only one in the room save, occasionally,
voices raised eagerly in the rehearsal going on in the drawing-room
next door. It was a tragedy in aid of an orphan asylum in England
which the notable wife was getting up; and once her voice could be
heard distinctly, saying to her daughter, 'Oh, Elsie, I'm sure you
could die better than that!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130284">Meanwhile the military magnate was reading:</p><p xml:id="fswater_130285">'I, servant of God, the all-powerful, and of the prophet
Mahomed--to whom be all praise. I, <hi rend="italic">Syyed</hi>
Ahmed-Oolah, the dust of the feet of the descendants of <hi rend="italic">Huzrut Ameer-Oodah-Moomereen-Ali-Moortuza</hi>, the
Holy.' He shifted uneasily, looked across the table, appeared
discouraged by that even scratching and went on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130286">'I, <hi rend="italic">Syyed</hi> Ahmed, after preferring my salaams
and the blessings of Holy War, to all believers of the sect of Sheeahs
or the sect of Sunnees alike, and also to all those having respectful
regards to the Faith, declare that I, the least of servants in the
company of those waiting on the Prophet, did by the order of God
receive a Sword of Honour, on condition that I should proclaim boldly
to all the duty of combining to drive out Infidels. In this,
therefore, is there great Reward; as is written in the Word of God,
since His Gracious Power is mighty for success. Yea! and if any fail,
will they not be rid of all the ends of this evil world, and attain
the Joys and Glories of Martyrdom? So be it. A sign is ever sufficient
to the intelligent, and the Duty of a servant is simply to point the
way.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130287">When he had finished he laid the document down on the table, and
for a minute or so continued to puff at his cigar. Then he broke
silence with that curious constraint in his tone, which most men
assume when religious topics crop up in general conversation.' I
wonder if this--this paper is to be considered the sign, or'--he
hesitated for a moment, then, the cadence of the proclamation being
suggestive, he finished his sentence to match--'or look we for
another?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130289">'Another!' retorted his companion irritably, 'according to Dashe
the whole of India is one vast sign-post! He seems to think we in
authority are blind to this. On the contrary, there is scarcely one
point he mentions which is not, I say this confidentially of course,
under inquiry, I<pb xml:id="fswater_130288" n="40 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> have the
files in my confidential box here and can show them to you now--No! by
the way the head-clerk has the key--that proclamation had to be
translated, of course. But, naturally, we don't proclaim this on the
house-tops. We might hurt people's feelings, or give rise to unfounded
hopes. As for these bazaar rumours Dashe retails with such zest, I
confess I think it undignified for a district-officer to give any heed
to them. They are inevitable with an ignorant population, and we,
having the testimony of a good conscience'--he glanced almost
unconsciously at the mantelpiece--'should disregard these ridiculous
lies. Of course every one--every one in the swim that is--admits that
the native army is most unsettled. And as Sir Charles Napier declared,
mutiny is the most serious danger in the future; in fact, if the first
symptoms are not grappled with, it may shake the very foundations. But
we are grappling with it, just as we are grappling, quietly, with the
general distrust. That was a most mischevious paragraph, by the way,
in the <hi rend="italic">Christian Observer</hi>, jubilant over the
alarm created by those first widow re-marriages the other day. So was
that in <hi rend="italic">Friend of India</hi>, calling attention to
the fact that a regular prayer was offered up in all the mosques for
the Restoration of the Royal Family. We don't want these things
noticed. We want to create a feeling of security by ignoring
them. That is our policy. Then as for Dashe's political news it is all
stale! That story, for instance, of the Embassy from Persia, and of
the old King of Delhi having turned a Sheeah--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130290">'That has something to do with saying Amen, hasn't it?' interrupted
the military magnate, with the air of one determined to get at the
bottom of things at all costs to himself.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130292">The political light smiled in superior fashion. 'Partially; but
politically--as a gauge I mean to probable antagonism--Sheeahs and
Sunnees are as wide apart as Protestants and Papists. The fact that
the Royal Family of Oude are Sheeahs, and the Delhi are Sunnee, is our
safeguard. Of course the old king's favourite wife, Zeenut Maihl, is
an Oude woman, but I don't credit the rumours. I had it carefully
inquired into, however, by a man who has special opportunities for
that sort of work. A very intelligent fellow, Greyman by name. He has
a black wife or--or something of that sort, which, of course helps him
to under<pb xml:id="fswater_130291" n="41 TAPE AND SEALING-WAX"/>stand the natives better
than most of us who--er--who don't--you understand--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130293">The military magnate, having a sense of humour, smiled to
himself. 'Perfectly,' he replied, 'and I'm inclined to think that
perhaps there is something to be said for a greater laxity.' In his
turn he glanced at the mantelpiece, and paused before that immaculate
presence. 'The proclamation, however,' he went on hurriedly, 'appears
to me a bit dangerous. Holy War is awkward, and a religious fanatic is
a tough subject even to regulars.' He had seen a rush of <hi rend="italic">Ghâzees</hi> once and the memory lingered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130294">'Undoubtedly. And as we have pointed out again and again to your
Department, here and at home, the British garrisons are too
scattered. These large accessions of territory have put them out of
touch with each other. But that again is being grappled with. In fact,
personally, I believe we are getting on as well as can be expected--'
He glanced here at the semicircle of children as if the phrase were
suggestive--'We are doing our best for India and the Indians. Now
here, in Oude, things are wonderfully shipshape already. Despite
Jackson and Gubbins' tiffs over trifles they are both splendid
workers, and Lucknow was never so well governed as it is to-day.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130295">'But about the proclamation,' persisted his hearer. 'Couldn't you
get some more information about it? That Greyman for instance.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130296">'I'm afraid not. He refused some other work I offered him not long
ago; said he was going home for good. I sometimes wish I could. It is
a thankless task slaving out here and being misunderstood, even at
home; being told in so many words that the very system under which we
were recruited has failed. Poor old Haileybury! I only hope
competition will do as well, but I doubt it; these new fellows can
never have the old <hi rend="italic">esprit de corps</hi>; won't come
from the same class! One of the Rajah's people was questioning me
about it only this morning--they read the English newspapers, of
course--'So we are not to have <hi rend="italic">Sahibs</hi> to rule
over us,' he said, looking black as thunder. 'Any <hi rend="italic">krani's</hi> (<hi rend="italic">lit.</hi> low-caste
English) son will do, if he has learnt enough.' I tried to explain--'
Here a red-coated orderly entering with a card, the speaker broke off
into angry inquiries why he was being disturbed contrary to
orders.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130297" n="42 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130298">The <hi rend="italic">Sahib</hi> bade me bring it,' replied the
man, as if that were sufficient excuse. His master looking at the card
tossed it over the table to the soldier, who exclaimed--'Talk of the
devil! He may as well come in, if you don't mind.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130299">So James Greyman was ushered in, and remained standing between the
civilian and the soldier; for it is not given to all to have the fine
perceptions of the native. The orderly had unhesitatingly classed the
visitor as a 'gentleman to be obeyed;' but the Political Department
knew him only as a reliable source of information.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130300">'Well, Greyman! Have you brought any more news?' asked the
civilian, in a tone intended to impress the Military Department with
the fact that here was one grapnel out of the many which were being
employed in bringing truth to the surface, and securing safety. But
the soldier, after one brief look at the new comer, sat up and squared
his own shoulders a bit.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130302">'That depends, sir,' replied James Greyman quietly, 'whether it
pays me to bring it or not. I told you last month that I could not
undertake any more work, because I was leaving India. My plans have
changed; and to be frank, I am rather hard up. If you could give me
regular employment I should be glad of it.' He spoke with the utmost
deliberation, but the incisive finality of every word, taking his
hearer unprepared, gave an impression of hurry, and left the civilian
breathless. James Greyman, however, having said what he had come to
say, said no more. During the past weekhHe had had plenty of time to
make up his mind, or rather to find out that it was made up; for he
recognised frankly that he was acting more on impulse than
reason. After he had buried poor little Zora away in accordance with
the customs of her people, and paid his racing bets and general
liabilities,--to do which he had found it necessary to sell most
things, including the very horse he had matched against Major
Erlton's,--he had suddenly found out, rather to his own surprise, that
the idea of starting again on the old lines was utterly distasteful to
him. In a lesser degree this second loss of his future and severing of
ties in the past, had had the same effect upon him as the previous
one. It had left him reckless, disposed to defy all he had lost, and
prove himself superior to ill-luck. Then being, by right of his Celtic
birth, imaginative, in a way superstitious, he had<pb xml:id="fswater_130301" n="43 TAPE AND SEALING-WAX"/> again and again found himself thrown back, as it
were, upon Kate Erlton's appeal for that chance, to bring which the
Spirit might be, even now, moving on the waters. It was that, that
only, with its swift touch on his own certainty that a storm was
brewing, which had made him yield his point; which had forced him into
yielding by an unreasoning assent to her suggestion that it might
bring a chance of atonement with it. And now, in calm deliberation, he
confessed that he might find his chance in it also; a better chance,
maybe, than he would have had in England. It would be his only one, at
any rate, for some time to come; since those grey-blue northern eyes
with the glint of steel in them had, by a few words, changed the
current of his life. The truth was unpalatable, but as usual he did
not attempt to deny it. He simply cast round for the best course in
which to flow towards that tide in the affairs of men which he hoped
to take at its flood; and political employment, briefly, spy's work,
seemed as good as any for the present.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130303">'Regular employment,' echoed the civilian, recovering from his
sense of hurry. 'You mean, I presume, as a news-writer.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130304">'As a spy, sir,' interrupted James Greyman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130305">The political light disregarded the suggestion. 'Your acquirements,
of course, would be suitable enough; but I fear there are no native
courts without one at present. And the situation hardly calls for
excess expenditure. But of course, any isolated <hi rend="italic">douceur</hi>--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130306">His hearer smiled. 'Call it payment, sir. But I think you must find
job-work in secret intelligence rather expensive. It produces such a
crop of mare's-nests; at least so I have found.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130307">The suspicion of equality in the remark made the official mount his
high horse, deftly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130308">'Really we have so many reliable sources of information,
Mr. Greyman,' he began, laying his hand as if casually on the papers
before him. The action was followed by James Greyman's keen eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130309">'You have the proclamation there, I see,' he said cheerfully. 'I
thought it could not be much longer before the police or some one else
became aware of its existence. The Moulvie himself was here about a
week ago.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130311">'The Moulvie--what Moulvie?' asked the military magnate
eagerly. The civilian, however, frowned. If confidential<pb xml:id="fswater_130310" n="44 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> work were to be carried out on those
lines, something, even if it were only ignorance, must be found
out.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130312">'The Moulvie of Fyzabad,' began James Greyman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130313">'And who--?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130314">'My dear sir,' interrupted the other pettishly. 'We really know all
about the Moulvie of Fyzabad. His name has been on the register of
suspects for months.' He rose, crossed to a bookshelf, and coming back
processionally with two big volumes, began to turn over the pages of
one.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130315">'<hi rend="italic">M--Mo</hi>--Ah! <hi rend="italic">Ma</hi>, no
doubt. That is correct, though transliteration is really a difficult
task--to be consistent, yet intelligible in a foreign language
is--No. It must be under F in the first volume. <hi rend="italic">F;
Fy.</hi> Just so! Here we are. "<hi rend="italic">Fyzabâd,
Moulvie of--fanatic, tall, medium colour, mole on inside of left
shoulder</hi>." This the man, I think?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130316">'I was not aware of the mole, sir,' replied James Greyman drily,
'but he is a magnificent preacher, a consistent patriot, a born
organiser; and he is now on his way to Delhi.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130317">'To Delhi?' echoed the civilian pettishly. 'What can a man of the
stamp you say he is, want with Delhi? A sham court, a miserable
pantaloon of a king, the prey of a designing woman who flatters his
dotage. I admit he is the representative of the Moghul dynasty, but
its record for the last hundred and fifty years is bad enough surely
to stamp out sentiment of that sort.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130318">'Prince Charles Edward was not a very admirable person, nor the
record of the Stuarts a very glorious one, and yet my grandfather--'
James Greyman pulled himself up sharply, and seeing an old prayer-book
lying on the table, which, with the alternatives of a bottle of Ganges
water and a copy of the Koran, lay ready for the discriminate swearing
of witnesses, finished his sentence by opening the volume at a certain
Office, and then placing the open book on the top of the
Proclamation. 'It will be no news to you, sir, that prayers of that
sort are being used in all the mosques. Of course here, in Lucknow,
they are for my late master's return. But if anything comparable to
the '15 or the '45 were to come, Delhi must be the centre. It is the
lens which would focus the largest area, the most rays; for it appeals
to greed as well as good, to this world as well as the next.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130319">'Do you think it a centre of disaffection now, Mr. Greyman?' asked
the military magnate with an emphasis on the title.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130320" n="45 TAPE AND SEALING-WAX"/><p xml:id="fswater_130321">'I do not know, sir. Zeenut Maihl, the Queen, has court intrigues,
but they are of little consequence.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130322">'I disagree,' protested the political. 'You require the experience
of a lifetime to estimate the enormous influence--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130323">'What do you consider of importance then?' interrupted the soldier
rather cavalierly, leaning across the table eagerly to look at James
Greyman. There was an instant's silence, during which those voices
rehearsing were clearly audible. The tragedy had apparently reached a
climax.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130324">'That; and this.' He pointed to the Proclamation, and a small
fragment of something which he took from his waistcoat pocket and laid
beside the paper. The civilian inspected it curiously, the soldier,
leaving his chair, came round to look at it also. The sunny room was
full of peace and solid security as those three Englishmen, with no
lack of pluck and brains, stood round the white fragment.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130325">'Looks like bone,' remarked the soldier.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130326">'It is bone, and it was found, so I heard in the bazaar to-day, at
the bottom of a commissariat flour-sack--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130327">James Greyman was interrupted by a relieved pshaw! from the
political light.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130328">'The old story, eh, Greyman! I wonder what next these ignorant
fools--"</p><p xml:id="fswater_130329">'When the ignorant fools happen to be drilled soldiers, and, in
Bengal, outnumber our English troops by twenty-four to one,' retorted
James Greyman sharply, 'it seems a work of supererogation to ask what
they will do next. If I were in their place--However, if I may tell
you how that came into my hands you will perhaps be able to grasp the
gravity of the situation.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130330">'Won't you take a chair?' asked the soldier quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130332">James Greyman glanced at the political. 'No, thanks, I won't be
long. There is a class of grain carriers called Bunjâras. They
keep herds of oxen, and have carried supplies for the Royal troops
since time immemorial. They have a charter engraved on a copper
breastplate. I've only seen a copy, for the original Jhungi and Bhungi
lived ages ago in Rajpootana. It runs so:
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>'While Jhungi Bhungi's oxen</l><l>Carry the army's corn,</l><l>House-thatch to feed their flocks on,</l><l>House-water ready drawn.</l><pb xml:id="fswater_130331" n="46 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><l>Three murders daily shriven,</l><l>These rights to them are given,</l><l>While Jhungi Bhungi's oxen</l><l>Carry the army's corn.'</l></lg></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_130333">'Preposterous,' murmered the civilian. 'That's at an end
anyhow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130334">'Naturally; for they no longer carry the corn. The method is too
slow, too Eastern for our commissariat. But the Oude levies used to
employ them. So did I at the stables. This is over also, and when I
last saw my <hi rend="italic">tanda</hi>--that's a caravan of them,
sir--they were sub-contracting under a rich Hindoo firm which was
dealing direct with the Department. They didn't like it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130335">'Still you can't deny that the growth of a strong, contented
commercial class with a real stake in the country--' began the
civilian hurriedly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130336">'That sounds like the home-counties or a vestry board,' interrupted
his hearer drily. 'The worst of it, in this case, being that you have
to get your content out of the petty dealers like these
Bunjâras. I came upon one yesterday telling a select circle of
admirers, in the strictest confidence of course, lest the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi> should kill him for letting the cat out of
the bag, that he had found that bit of bone at the bottom of a
Commissariat sack he bought to mend his own. The moral being, of
course, that it was safer to buy from him. But he was only half
through when I, knowing the scoundrel, fell on him and thrashed him
for lying. The audience approved, and assented to his confession that
it was a lie; but only to please me, the man with the stick. And as
for Jhungi, he will tell the tale with additional embellishments in
every village to which the caravan goes; unless some is there to
thrash him if he does.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130337">'Scoundrel,' muttered the soldier, angrily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130338">'Or saint,' added James Greyman. 'He will be that when he comes to
believe in his own story of having burnt the sack rather than use
it. That won't be long. Then he will be much more dangerous. However,
if there is no place vacant for me, sir--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130339">'If you would not mind waiting a minute,' began the military
magnate, with a hasty look at the political.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130341">James Greyman bowed, and retired discreetly to the window. It
looked out upon just such another garden as<pb xml:id="fswater_130340" n="47 TAPE AND SEALING-WAX"/> Kate Erlton's, and the remembrance provoked the cynical
question as to what the devil he was doing in that galley? Racing was
a far safer way of making money than acting as a spy--to no purpose
possibly, at least so far as his own chance was concerned.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130342">Yet five minutes after, when the political was writing him out a
safe conduct in the event of his ever getting into difficulties with
the authorities, he interrupted the scratching of the pen to say,
suddenly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130343">'If you would make it out in my own name, sir, I should prefer
it. James Sholto Douglas, late of the	--th Regiment.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130344">'Hm!' said the military magnate thoughtfully when the new <hi rend="italic">employé</hi> in the Secret Intelligence
Department left the room. 'So that is Jim Douglas, is it? I thought he
was a service man by the set of his shoulders. Jim Douglas. I remember
his case when I was in the A.-G.'s office.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130345">'What was it?' asked the civilian curiously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130346">'Oh, a woman, of course. I forget the details; she was the wife of
his major, a drunken beast. There was something about a blow, and she
didn't back him up; saved her reputation, you understand. But he was
an uncommonly smart officer, I know that.'</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0105" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V<lb/>BRAVO!</head><p xml:id="fswater_130347">THE Gissing's house stood in a large garden; but though it was
wreathed with creepers, and set with flowers after the manner of
flowerful Lucknow, there was no cult of pansies or such like English
treasures here. It was gay with that acclimatised tangle of poppies
and larkspur, marigold, mignonette, and corn cockles which Indian
gardeners love to sow broadcast in their cartwheel mud-beds; '<hi rend="italic">powder of flowers</hi>,' as they call the mixed seeds
they save for it from year to year.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130349">In the big dark dining-room also--where Alice Gissing, looking half
her years in starched white muslin, and blue ribbons, sat at the head
of the table--there was no cult of Eng<pb xml:id="fswater_130348" n="48 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>land. Everything was frankly staunchly of the
nabob-and-pagoda-tree style; for the Gissings preferred India, where
they were received into society, to England, where they would have
been out of it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130350">It had been one those heavy luncheons, beginning with many meats
and much bottled beer, ending with much madeira and many cigars, which
sent the insurance rate for India up to war risks in those days.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130351">And there was never any scarcity of the best beer at the Gissings,
seeing that he had the contract for supplying it to the British
troops. His wife, however, preferred solid-looking porter with a
creamy head to it, and a heavy odour which lingered about her pretty
smiling lips. It was a most incongruous drink for one of her
appearance; but it never seemed to affect either her gay little body
or her gay little brain. The one remained youthful, slender; the other
brightly, uncompromisingly clear.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130352">She had been married twice. Once in extreme youth to a clerk in the
Opium Department, who owed the good looks which had attracted her to a
trace of dark blood. Then she had chosen wealth in the person of
Mr. Gissing. Had he died, she would probably have married for
position; since she had a catholic taste for the amenities of
life. But he had not died, and she had lived with him for ten years in
goodnatured toleration of all his claims upon her. As a matter of
fact, they did not affect her in the least, and in her clear, high
voice, she used to wonder openly why other women worried over
matrimonial troubles, or fussed over so slight an encumbrance as a
husband. In a way she felt equal to more than one, provided they did
not squabble over her. That was unpleasant, and she not only liked
things to be pleasant, but had the knack of making them so; both to
the man whose name she bore, and whose house she used as a convenient
spot wherein to give luncheon parties, and to the succession of
admirers who came to them and drank her husband's beer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130354">He was a vulgar creature, but an excellent business man, with a
knack of piling up the rupees which made the minor native contractors,
whose trade he was gradually absorbing, gnash their teeth in sheer
envy. For the Western system of risking all to gain all was too much
opposed to the Eastern one of risking nothing to gain little, for the
hereditary<pb xml:id="fswater_130353" n="49 BRAVO"/> merchants to adopt it at once. They
have learnt the trick of fence and entered the lists successfully
since then; but in 1856 the foe was new. So they fawned on the shrewd
despoiler instead, and curried favour by bringing his wife fruits and
sweets, with something costlier hidden in the oranges or sugar
drops. Alice Gissing accepted everything with a smile; for her husband
was not a Government servant; the contracts, however, being for
Government supplies, the givers did not discriminate the position so
nicely. They used to complain that the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi>
robbed them both ways, much to Mr. Gissing's amusement, who, as a
method of self-glorification, would allude to it at the luncheon
parties where many men came who, between the intervals of badinage
with the gay little hostess, could talk with authority on most
affairs. They did not bring their wives with them, but Alice Gissing
did not seem to mind that; she did not get on with women.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130356">'So they complain I rob them, do they ?' he said loudly,
complacently, to the men on either side of him. 'My dear Colonel! an
Englishman is bound to rob a native if that means creaming the market,
for they haven't been educated, sir, on those sound commercial
principles which have made England the first nation in the world. Take
this flour contract they are howling about. I'm beer by rights, of
course, and, by George, I'm proud of it! Your men, Colonel, can't do
without beer, England can't do without soldiers; so my business is
sound. But why shouldn't I have my finger in any other pie which holds
money? These hereditary fools think I shouldn't, and they were trying
a ring, sir. Ha! ha! an absurd upside-down d----d oriental ring, based
on utterly rotten principles. You can't keep up the price of a
commodity because your grandfather got that price! They ignored the
facility of transport given by roads, etc.; ignored the right of
Government to benefit--er--slightly--by these outlays. Commerce isn't
a selfish thing, sir, by gad! If you don't consider your market a bit,
you won't find one at all. So I stepped in, and made thousands; for
the Commissariat, seeing the saving here, of course asked me to
contract for other places. It serves the idiots uncommon well right;
but it will benefit them in the end. If they're to face Western
nations they must learn--er--the--the morality of speculation.' He
paused, helped himself to another glass of madeira,<pb xml:id="fswater_130355" n="50 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> and added in an unctuous tone, 'but till
they do, India's a good place.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130357">'Is that Gissing preaching morality,' asked his wife, in her clear
high voice. The men at her end of the table had had their share of
her, she thought, and those others might be getting bored by her
husband.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130358">'Only the morality of business,' put in a coarse-looking fellow
who, having been betwixt and between the conversations, had been
drinking rather heavily. 'There's no need for you to join the ladies
as yet, Mrs Gissing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130359">Major Erlton, at her right hand, scowled, and the boy on her left
flushed up to the eyes. He was her latest admirer, and was still in
the stage when she seemed an angel incarnate. Only the day before he
had wanted to call out a cynical senior who had answered his vehement
wonder as to how a woman like she was could have married a little
beast like Gissing, with the irreverent suggestion that it might be
because the name rhymed with kissing.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130360">In the present instance she heeded neither the scowl nor the flush,
and her voice came calmly. 'I don't intend to, Doctor. I mean to send
you into the drawing-room instead. That will be quite as effectual to
the proprieties.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130361">Amid the laugh, Major Erlton found opportunity for an admiring
whisper that she had got the brute well above the belt that time. But
the boy's flush deepened; he looked at his goddess with pained
perplexed eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130362">'The morality of speculation or gambling,' retorted the doctor,
speaking slowly and staring at the delighted Major angrily, 'is the
art of winning as much money as you can--conveniently. That reminds
me, Erlton; you must have raked in a lot over that match.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130363">A sudden dull red showed on the face whose admiration Alice was
answering by a smile.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130364">'I won a lot also,' she interrupted hastily. 'Thanks to your tip,
Erlton. You never forget your friends.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130366">'No one could forget you--there is no merit'--began the boy,
hastily, then paused before the publicity of his own words, and
bewildered by the smile now given to him. Herbert Erlton noted the
fact sullenly. He knew that for the time being all the little lady's
personal interest was his; but he also knew that was not nearly so
much as he gave her. And he wanted more, not understanding that if
she<pb xml:id="fswater_130365" n="51 BRAVO"/> had had more to give she would probably have
been less generous than she was; being of that class of women who sin
because the sin has no appreciable effect on them, but leaves them
strangely, inconceivably unsoiled. This imperviousness, however,
being, as a rule, considered the man's privilege only, Major Erlton
failed to understand the position, and so, feeling aggrieved, turned
on the lad.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130367">'I'll remember you next time if you like, Mainwaring,' he said 'but
some one has to lose in every game. I'd grasped that fact before I was
your age, and made up my mind it shouldn't be me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130368">'Sound commercial morality!' laughed another guest.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130369">'Try it, Mainwaring, at the next <hi rend="italic">Gymkhâna</hi>. By the way, I hear that
professional, Greyman, is off, so amateurs will have a chance now; he
was a devilish fine rider.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130370">'Rode a devilish fine horse, too,' put in the unappeased
doctor. 'You bought it, Erlton, in spite--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130371">'Yes! for fifteen hundred,' interrupted the Major, in unmistakable
defiance. 'A long price, but there was hankypanky in that
match. Greyman tried fussing to cover it. You never can trust
professionals. However, I <hi rend="italic">and my friends</hi> won,
and I shall win again with the horse. Take you evens in gold <hi rend="italic">mohurs</hi> for the next	--' There was always a
sledgehammer method in the Major's fence, and the subject dropped.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130372">The room was heavy with the odours of meats and drinks. Dark as it
was, the flood of sunshine streaming into the verandah outside where
yellow hornets were buzzing and the servants washing up the dishes,
sent a glare even into the shadows. Neither the furniture nor
appointments of the room owed anything to the East--for Indian art
was, so to speak, not as yet invented for English folk--yet there was
a strange unkennedness about their would-be familiarity which suddenly
struck the latest exile, young Mainwaring.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130373">'India is a beastly hole,' he said, in an undertone--'things are so
different--I wish I were out of it.' There was a note of appeal in his
young voice; his eyes, meeting Alice Gissing, filled--to his intense
dismay--with tears. He hoped she might not see them; but she did, and
leant over to lay one kindly be-ringed little hand on the table quite
close to his.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130375">'You've got liver,' she said, confidentially.'India is quite a nice
place. Come to the assembly to-night, and I<pb xml:id="fswater_130374" n="52 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> will give you two extras--whole ones. And don't drink
any more Madeira, there is a good boy. Come and have coffee with me in
the drawing-room instead; that will set you right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130376">Less has set many a boy hopelessly wrong. To do Alice Gissing
justice, however, she never recognised such facts; her own head being
quite steady. But Major Erlton understood the possible results
perfectly, and commented on them when, as a matter of course, his long
length remained lounging in an easy chair after the other guests had
gone, and Mr. Gissing had retired to business. People, from the <hi rend="italic">Palais Royale</hi> playwrights downwards--or
upwards--always poke fun at the husband in such situations; but no one
jibes at the man who succeeds to the cut-and-dried necessity for
devotion. Yet there is surely something ridiculous in the spectacle of
a man playing a conjugal part without even a sense of duty to give him
dignity in it? As a matter of fact the curse of the common-place comes
as quickly to Abelard and Heloise as it does to Darby and Joan. So
Major Erlton, lounging and commenting, might well have been
Mrs. Gissing's legal owner.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130377">'Going to make a fool of that lad now, I suppose, Allie,' he
said. 'Why the devil should you when you don't care for boys ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130378">She came to stand in front of him like a child, her hands behind
her back, but her china-blue eyes had a world of shrewdness in
them. 'Don't I? Do you think I care for men either? I don't. You just
amuse me, and I've got to be amused. By the way, did you remember to
order the cart at five sharp? I want to go round the fair before the
Club.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130380">If they had been married ten times over, their spending the
afternoon together could not have been more of a foregone conclusion;
there seemed, indeed, no choice in the matter. And they were
prosaically punctual, too; at 'five sharp' they climbed into the high
dog-cart boldly, in face of a whole <hi rend="italic">posse</hi> of
servants, dressed in the nabob and pagoda-tree style with silver
crests in their pith turbans and huge monograms on their breastplates;
old-fashioned servants with the most antiquated notions as to the
needs of the <hi rend="italic">sahib logue</hi>, and a fund of passive
resentment for the least change in the inherited routine of
service--changes which they referred to the fact that the new-fangled
<hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> were not real <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi>. But the heavy little and big breakfasts,
the unlimited beer, the solid<pb xml:id="fswater_130379" n="53 BRAVO"/> dinners, the milk
punch and brandy <hi rend="italic">pâni</hi>, all had their
appointed values in the Gissing's house; so the servants watched their
mistress with approving smiles. And on Mondays there was always a
larger <hi rend="italic">posse</hi> than usual to see the old Mai--who
had been Alice Gissing's ayah for years and years--hand up the bouquet
which the gardener always had ready, and say, 'My salaams to the
missy-<hi rend="italic">baba</hi>.' Mrs. Gissing used to take the
flowers just as she took her parasol or her gloves. Then she would
say, 'All right,' partly to the ayah, partly to her cavalier, and the
dog-cart, or buggy, or mail-phaeton--which ever it happened to
be--would go spinning away. For the old Mai had handed the flowers
into many different turn-outs, remaining always on the steps ready,
with the authority of age and long service, to crush any frivolous
remarks new-comers might make. But the destination of the bouquet was
always the same; and that was to stand in a peg tumbler at the foot of
a tiny white marble cross in the cemetery. Mrs. Gissing put a fresh
offering in it every Monday, going through the ceremony with a placid
interest; for the date on the cross was far back in the years. Still,
she used to speak of the little life which had come into and gone from
hers when she was yet a child herself, with a certain self-possessed
plaintiveness born of long habit.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130381">'I was barely seventeen,' she would say, 'and it was a dear little
thing. Then Saumarez was transferred, and I never returned to Lucknow
till I married Gissing. It was odd wasn't it, marrying twice to the
same station. But, of course, I can't ask him to come here, so it is
doubly kind of you; for I couldn't come alone, it is so sad.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130383">Her blue eyes would be limpid with actual tears; yet as she waited
for the return of the tumbler, which the watchman always had to wash
out, she looked more like some dainty figure on a cracker than a
weeping Niobe. Nevertheless, the admirers whom she took in succession
into her confidence, thought it sweet and womanly of her never to have
forgotten the dead baby, though they approved of her dislike to live
ones. Some of them, when their part in the weekly drama came upon
them--as it always did--in the first flush of their fancy for the
principal actress in it, began by being quite sentimental over
it. Herbert Erlton did. He went so far once as to bring an additional
bouquet of pansies from his wife's pet bed; but the little lady had
looked at it with plain<pb xml:id="fswater_130382" n="54 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>tive
distrust. Pansies withered so soon, she said, and as the bouquet had
to last a whole week, something less fragile was better. Indeed, the
gardener's bouquets, compact, hard, with the blossoms all jammed into
little spots of colour among the protruding sprigs of privet, were
more suited to her calm permanency of regret than the passionate
purple posy which looked so pathetically out of place in the big man's
coarse hands. She had taken it from him, however, and strewn the
already drooping flowers about the marble. They looked lovely, she had
said, though the others were best, as she liked everything to be tidy
because she had been very, very fond of the poor little dear. Saumarez
had never been kind, and it had been so pretty; dark like its father,
who had been a very handsome man. She had cried for days, then, though
she didn't like children now. But she would always remember this one,
always! The old Mai and she often talked of it; especially when she
was dressing for a ball, because the gardener brought bouquets for
them also.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130384">Major Erlton, therefore, gave no more pansies, and his sentiment
died down into a sort of irritable wonder what the little woman would
be at. The unreality of it all struck him afresh on this particular
Monday, as he watched her daintily removing a few fallen petals. So he
left her to finish her task while he walked about. The cemetery was a
perfect garden of a place, with rectangular paths bordered by shrubs
which rose from a tangle of annual flowers like that around the
Gissing's house. This blossoming screen hid the graves for the most
part; but in the older portions great, domed erections--generally
safeguarding an infant's body--rose above it more like summer-houses
than tombs. Herbert Erlton preferred this part of the cemetery, for it
was less suggestive than the newer portion, and he was one of those
wholesome hearty animals, to whom the very idea of death is
horrible. So hither, after a time, she came, stepping daintily over
the graves, and pausing an instant on the way to add a sprig of
mignonette to the rosebud she had brought from a bush beside the
cross--it was a fine healthy bush which yielded a constant supply of
buds suitable for buttonholes. She looked charming, but he met her
with a perplexed frown.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130385">'I've been wondering, Allie,' he said, 'what you would have been
like if that baby had lived. Would you have cared for it ?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130386" n="55 BRAVO"/><p xml:id="fswater_130387">Her eyes grew startled. 'But I do care for it! Why should I come if
I didn't? It isn't amusing I'm sure; so I think it very unkind of you
to suggest--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130388">'I never suggested anything,' he protested. 'I know you did--that
you do care. But if it had lived--' he paused as if something escaped
his mental grasp--'Why, I expect you would have been different
somehow; and I was wondering--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130389">'Oh! don't wonder, please, its a bad habit,' she replied, suddenly
appeased. 'You will be wondering next if I care for you. As if you
didn't know that I do.' She was pinning the buttonhole into his coat
methodically, and he could not refuse an answering smile; but the
puzzled look remained.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130390">'I suppose you do, or you wouldn't--' he began slowly, then a
sudden emotion showed in face and voice. 'You slip from me somehow,
Allie,--slip like an eel. I never get a real hold--Well! I wonder if
women understand themselves? They ought to, for nobody else can,
that's one comfort.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130391">Whether he meant he was no denser than previous recipients of
rose-buds, or that mankind benefited by failing to grasp feminine
standards was not clear; and Mrs. Gissing was more interested in the
fact that the mare was growing restive. So they climbed into the high
dog-cart again, and took her a quieting spin down the road. The fresh
wind of their own speed blew in their faces, the mare's feet scarcely
seemed to touch the ground, the trees slipped past quickly, the
palm-squirrels fled chirrupping. He flicked his whip gaily at them in
boyish fashion as he sat well back, his big hand giving to the mare's
mouth. Hers lay equably in her lap, though the pace would have made
most women clutch at the rail.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130392">'Jolly little beasts, ain't they, Allie?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130393">'Jolly altogether; jolly as it can be,' she replied with the frank
delight of a girl. They had forgotten themselves innocently enough;
but one of the men in a dog-cart, past which they flashed, put on an
outraged expression.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130394">'Erlton and Mrs. Gissing again!' he fussed. 'I shall tell my wife
to cut her. Being in business ourselves we have tried to keep
square. But this is an open scandal. I wonder Mrs. Erlton puts up with
it. I wouldn't.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130396">His companion shook his head. 'Dangerous work saying that. Wait
till you are a woman. I know more about them<pb xml:id="fswater_130395" n="56 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> than most, being a doctor, so I never venture on an
opinion. But, honestly, I believe most women--that little one ahead
into the bargain--don't care a button one way or the other. And, for
all our talk, I don't believe we do either, when all is said and
done.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130397">'What is said and done?' asked the other peevishly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130398">There was a pause. The lessening dog-cart with its flutter of
muslin, its driver sitting square to his work, showed on the hard
white road which stretched like a narrowing ribbon over the empty
plain. Far ahead a little devil of wind swept the dust against the
blue sky like a cloud. Nearer at hand lay a cluster of mud hovels,
and--going towards it before the dogcart--a woman was walking along
the dusty side of the road. She had a bundle of grass on her head, a
baby across her hip, a toddling child clinging to her skirts. The
afternoon sun sent their shadows conglomerately across the white
metal.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130399">'Passion, Love, Lust, the attraction of sex for sex,--what you
will,' said the doctor, breaking the silence. 'Nothing is easier
knocked out of a man, if he is worth calling one--a bugle call, a
tight corner--God Almighty!--they're over that child! Drive on like
the devil, man, and let me see what I can do.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130400">There is never much to do when all has been done in an
instant. There had been a sudden causeless leaving of the mother's
side, a toddling child among the shadows, a quick oath, a mad rear as
the mare, checked by hands like a vice for strength, snapped the
shafts as if they had been straws. No delay, no recklessness; but one
of these iron-shod hoofs as it was flung out, had caught the child
full on the temple, and there was no need to ask what that curved blue
mark meant, which had gone crashing into the skull.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130401">Alice Gissing had leapt from the dogcart and stood looking at the
pitiful sight with wide eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130402">'We couldn't do anything,' she said in an odd hard voice, as the
others joined her. 'There was nothing we could do. Tell the woman,
Herbert, that we couldn't help it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130404">But the Major, making the still plunging mare a momentary excuse
for not facing the ghastly truth, had, after one short, sharp
exclamation--almost of fear--turned to help the groom; so there was no
sound for a minute save the plunging of hoofs on the hard ground, the
groom's cheerful voice lavishing en<pb xml:id="fswater_130403" n="57 BRAVO"/>dearments on
his restless charge, and a low animal-like whimper from the mother,
who, after one wild shriek, had sunk down in the dust beside the dead
child, looking at the purple bruise dully, and clasping her living
baby tighter to her breast. For it, thank the gods! was the boy. That
one with the mark on its forehead only the girl.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130405">Then the doctor, who had been busy with deft but helpless hands,
rose from his knees, saying a word or two in Hiudustani which provoked
a whining reply from the woman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130406">'She admits it was no one's fault,' he said. 'So, Erlton, if you
will take our dog-cart--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130407">But the Major had faced the position by this time. 'I can't go. She
is a camp follower, I expect, and I shall have to find out,--for
compensation and all that. If you would take Mrs. Gissing--' His
voice, steady till then, broke perceptibly over the name; its owner
looked up sharply, and going over to him laid her hand on his arm.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130408">'It wasn't your fault,' she said, still in that odd hard
voice. 'You had the mare in hand; she didn't stir an inch. It is a
dreadful thing to happen, but--' she threw her head back a little, her
wide eyes narrowed as a frown puckered her smooth forehead, 'it isn't
as if we could have prevented it. The thing had to be.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130409">She might have been the incarnation of Fate itself as she glanced
down at the dead child in the dust, at the living one reaching from
its mother's arms to touch its sister curiously, at the slow tears of
the mother herself as she acquiesced in the eternal fitness of things;
for a girl more or less was not much in the mud hovel, where she and
her man lived hardly, and the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> would
doubtless give rupees in exchange, for they were just. But the tears
came faster when, with conventional wailing the women from the
clustering huts joined her, while the men, frankly curious, listened
to the groom's spirited description of the accident.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130410">'You had better go, Allie; you do no good here,' said the Major
almost roughly. He was anxious to get through with it all--he was
absorbed in it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130411">So the man who had said he was going to tell his wife to cut
Mrs. Gissing, had to help her into the dog-cart.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130413">'It was horrible, wasn't it?' she said suddenly when, in silence,
they had left the little tragedy far behind them. 'We were going a
frightful pace, but you saw he had the mare<pb xml:id="fswater_130412" n="58 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> in hand. He is awfully strong you know.' She paused,
and in a reflectively-complacent smile stole to her face. 'I suppose
you will think it horrid,' she went on; 'but it doesn't feel to me
like killing a human being, you know. I'm sorry, of course, but I
should have been much sorrier if it had been a white baby. Wouldn't
you?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130414">She set aside his evasion remorselessly. 'I know all that! People
say, of course, that it is wicked not to feel the same towards people
whether they're black or white. But we don't. And they don't
either. They feel just the same about us because we are white. Don't
you think they do ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130415">'The antagonism of race--' he began sententiously, but she cut him
short again; this time with an irrelevant remark.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130416">'I wonder what your wife would say if she saw me driving in your
dog-cart?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130417">He stared at her helplessly. The one problem was as unanswerable as
the other.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130418">'You had better drive round the back way to the Fair,' she said
considerately. 'Somebody there will take me off your hands. Otherwise
you will have to drive me to the Club; for I'm not going home. It
would be dreadful after that horrid business. Besides the Fair will
cheer me up. One doesn't understand it, you know, and the people crowd
along like figures on a magic-lantern slide. I mean that you never
know what's coming next, and that is always so jolly, isn't it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130419">It might be, but the man with the wife felt relieved when, five
minutes afterwards, she transferred herself to young Mainwaring's
buggy. The boy, however, felt as if an angel had fluttered down from
the skies to the worn broken-springed cushion beside him; an angel to
be guarded from humanity--even her own.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130420">'How the beggars stare,' he said, after they had walked the horse
for a space through the surging crowds. 'Let us get away from the
grinning apes.' He would have liked to take her to paradise and put
flaming swords at the gate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130422">'They don't grin,' she replied curtly, 'they stare like
Bank-holiday people stare at the wild beasts in the Zoo. But let us
get away from the watered road, the policemen, and all that. That's no
fun. See, go down that turning<pb xml:id="fswater_130421" n="59 BRAVO"/> into the middle
of it; you can get out that way to the river road afterwards if you
like.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130423">The bribe was sufficient; it was not far across to peace and quiet,
so the turn was made. Nor was the staring worse in the irregular lane
of booths and stalls down which they drove, and though the air was
full of throbbings of tomtoms, twangling of <hi rend="italic">sutaras</hi>, intermittent poppings and fizzings of
squibs, the unchecked crowd was strangely silent despite the
numberless children carried shoulder high to see the show. But it was
also strangely insistent; going on its way regardless of the shouting
groom.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130424">'Take care,' said Mrs. Gissing lightly, 'don't run over another
child. By the way, I forgot to tell you--the Fair was so funny--but
Erlton ran over a black baby. It wasn't his fault a bit, and the
mother, luckily, didn't seem to mind; because it was a girl, I
expect. Aren't they an odd people? One really never knows what will
make them cry or laugh.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130425">Something was apparently amusing them at that moment, however, for
a burst of boisterous merriment pealed from a dense crowd near a booth
pitched in an open space.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130426">'What's that?' she cried sharply. 'Let's go and see.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130427">She was out of the dog-cart as she spoke, despite his protest that
it was impossible--that she must not venture.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130428">'Do you imagine they'll murder me?' she asked with an <hi rend="italic">insouciant</hi> incredulous laugh. 'What nonsense. Here,
good people, let me pass, please!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130429">She was by this time in the thick of the crowd, which gave way
instinctively, and he could do nothing but follow, his boyish face
stern with the mere thought her idle words had conjured up. Do her any
injury? Her dainty dress should not even be touched if he could help
it! But the sightseers, most of them peasants beguiled from their
fields for this Festival of Spring, had never seen an English lady at
such close quarters before, if, indeed, they had ever seen one at
all. So, though they gave way they closed in again, silent, but
insistent in their curiosity; while, as the centre of attraction came
nearer, the crowd in front became denser, more absorbed in the bursts
of merriment. There was ring of license in them which made young
Mainwaring plead hurriedly--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130430">'Mrs. Gissing!--don't--please don't.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130432">'But I want to see what they're laughing at,' she replied;<pb xml:id="fswater_130431" n="60 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> and then, in perfect mimicry of
the groom's familiar cry, her high clear voice echoed over the heads
in front of her: '<hi rend="italic">Hut! Hut! Ari bhaiyan!
Hut!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130433">They turned to see her gay face full of smiles, joyous, confident,
sympathetic, and the next minute the cry was echoed with approving
grins from a dozen responsive throats.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130434">'Stand back, brothers! Stand back!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130435">There were quick hustlings to right and left, quick nods and
smiles, even broad laughs full of good fellowship; so that in no time
she found herself at the innermost circle, with a clear view of the
central space, of the cause of the laughter; it made her give a faint
gasp and stand transfixed. Two white-masked figures, clasped waist to
waist, were waltzing about tipsily. One had a curled flaxen wig, a
muslin dress distended by an all too visible crinoline giving full
play to a pair of prancing brown legs. The other wore an old staff
uniform, cocked hat and feather complete. The flaxen curls rested on
the tarnished epaulet, the unembracing arms flourished brandy
bottles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130436">It was a vile travesty; and the Englishwoman turned instinctively
to the Englishman as if doubtful what to do, how to take it; but the
passion on his boyish face seemed to make things clear--to give her
the clue, and she gripped his hand hard.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130437">'Don't be a fool!' she whispered fiercely. 'Laugh! It's the only
thing to do.' Her own rang out shrill above the uncertain stir in the
crowd, taken aback in its merriment.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130438">But something else rose above it also. A single word--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130439">'Bravo!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130440">She turned like lightning to the sound, her cheeks for the first
time aflame, but she could see no one in the circle of dark faces whom
she could credit with the exclamation. Yet she felt sure she had heard
it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130442">'Bravo!' Had it been said in jest or earnest, in mockery or-- Young
Mainwaring interrupted the problem by suggesting that as the maskers
had run away into a booth, where he could not follow and give them the
licking they deserved because of her presence, it might be as well for
her to escape further insult by returning to the buggy. His tone was
as full of reproach as that of a lad in love could be, but
Mrs. Gissing was callous. She declared she was glad to have seen what
she had seen. Englishmen did drink and English<pb xml:id="fswater_130441" n="61 BRAVO"/>women waltzed. Why then, shouldn't the natives poke fun at
both habits if they chose? They themselves could laugh at other
things. And laugh she did, recklessly, at everything and everybody for
the remainder of the drive. But underneath her gaiety she was harping
on that 'Bravo!' And suddenly, as they drove by the river, she broke
in on the boy's prattle to say excitedly: 'I have it! It must have
been the one in the Afghan cap who said "Bravo!" He was fairer than
the rest. Perhaps he was an Englishman disguised. Well! I should know
him again if I saw him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130443">'Him? who--what? Who said bravo!' asked the lad. He had been too
angry to notice the exclamation at the time.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130444">She looked at him quizzically. 'Not you--you abused me. But some
one did--or didn't'--here her little slack hands resting in her lap
clasped each other tightly. 'I rather wish I knew. I'd rather like to
make him say it again. Bravo! Bravo!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130445">And then, as if at her own mimicry, she returned to her childish
unreasoning laugh.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0106" n="6" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI<lb/>THE GIFT OF MANY FACES</head><p xml:id="fswater_130447">MRS. GISSING had guessed right. The man in the Afghan cap was Jim
Douglas, who found the disguise of a frontiersman the easiest to
assume, when, as now, he wanted to mix in a crowd. And he would have
said 'Bravo' a dozen times over if he had thought the little lady
would like to hear it, for her quick denial of the possibility of
insult had roused his keenest admiration. Here had spoken a dignity he
had not expected to find in one whom he only knew as a woman Major
Erlton delighted to honour. A dignity lacking in the big brave boy
beside her; lacking, alas! in many a big brave Englishman of greater
importance. So he had risked detection by that sudden 'Bravo.' Not
that he dreaded it much. To begin with, he was used to it, even when
he posed as an out-lander, for there was a trick in his gait, not to
be orientalised, which made policemen salute gravely as he passed
disguised to the enth, and there was ignorance of<pb xml:id="fswater_130446" n="62 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> some one or another of the million shibboleths
which divide men from each other in India; shibboleths too numerous
for one lifetime's learning, which require to be born in the blood,
bred in the bone. In this case, also, he had every intention of
asserting his race by licking some of the offenders when the show was
over; for he happened to know one of them; having indeed licked him a
few days before over a certain piece of bone. So, as the crowd,
accepting the finale of one amusement placidly, drifted away to see
another, he walked over to the tent in which the discomfited
caricaturists had found refuge. It was a tattered old military
bell-tent, bought most likely with the tattered old staff uniform at
some auction. As he lifted the flap the sound of escaping feet made
him expect a stern chase; but he was mistaken. Two figures rose with
the start of studied surprise and salaamed profoundly as he
entered. They were both stark naked save for a waistcloth, and Jim
Douglas could not resist a quick glance round for the discarded
costumes. They were nowhere to be seen; being hidden, probably, under
the litter of properties strewing the squalid green-room. Still of the
identity of the man he knew Jim Douglas had no doubt, and as this one
was also the nearest, he promptly seized him by both shoulders and
gave him a sound western kick, which would have been followed by
others if the recipient had not slipped from his hold like an eel; for
Jhungi, Bunjâra and general vagrant, habitually oiled himself
from head to foot after the manner of his profession as a precaution
against such possible attempts at capture.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130448">His assailant, grasping this fact, at any rate, did not risk
dignity by pursuit, though the man stood salaaming again, within arm's
length.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130449">'You scoundrel!' said Jim Douglas with as much severity as he could
command before the mixture of deference and defiance, innocence and
iniquity, in the sharp cunning face before him. 'Wasn't the licking I
gave you before enough?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130450">Jhungi superadded perplexity to his other show of emotions. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> mistakes,' he said, with sudden cheerful
understanding. 'It was the miscreant Bhungi, my brother, whom the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> licked. The misbegotten idler who tells lies
in the bazaar about bones and sacks. So his skin smarts, but my body
is whole. Is it not so, Father Tiddu?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130452">The appeal to his companion was made with curious eager<pb xml:id="fswater_130451" n="63 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/>ness, and Jim Douglas, who had
heard this tale of the ill-doing double before, looked at the witness
to it with interest. That this man was or was not Jhungi's co-offender
he could not say with certainty, for there was a remarkable lack of
individuality about both face and figure when in repose; and save for
the faint frostiness of sprouting grey hairs on a shaven cheek and
skull he might have been any age. But the nickname of Tiddu, or
cricket, was immediately explained by the jerky angularity of his
actions.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130453">'Of a truth it was Bhungi,' he said in a well-modulated but creaky
voice. 'Time was when liars, such as he, fell dead. Now they don't
even catch fevers, and if they do, the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi>
give them bitter powder and start them lying again. So, since one dead
fish stinks a whole tank, virtuous Jhungi, being like as two peas in a
pod, suffers an ill-name. But Bhungi will know what it means to tell
lies when he stands before his Creator. Nevertheless in this world the
master being enraged--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130454">'Not so, Father Tiddu,' interrupted Jhungi glibly, 'the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> is but enraged with Bhungi. And rightly. Did
not we hide our very faces for shame while he mimicked the noble
people? Did we not try to hold him when he fled from punishment--as
the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> no doubt heard--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130455">Jim Douglas without a word slipped his hand down the man's
back. The wales of a sound hiding were palpable; so was his wince as
he dodged aside to salaam again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130456">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> is a male judge,' he said
admiringly. 'No black man could deceive him. This slave has certainly
been whipped. He fell among liars who robbed him of his
reputation. Will the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> do likewise? On the
honour of a Bunjâra 'tis Bhungi whom the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> beats. He gives Jhungi bitter powders when
he gets the fever. And even Bhungi but tries to earn a stomachful as
he can, when the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> take his trade from
him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130457">'The world grows hollow, to match a man's swallow, quoted Tiddu
affably.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130458">The familiar by-word of poverty, the quaint mingling of truth and
falsehood, daring and humility, in Jhungi's plea roused both Jim
Douglas's sense of humour, and the sympathy--which with him was always
present--for the hardness and squalidness of so many of the lives
around him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130460">'But you can surely earn the stomachful honestly,' he said,<pb xml:id="fswater_130459" n="64 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> anger passing into
irritation. 'What made you take to this trade?' He kicked at a pile of
properties, and in so doing disclosed the skeleton of a crinoline;
Jhungi, with a shocked expression, stooped down and covered it up
decorously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130461">'Because it is my trade,' he replied; 'the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> must surely have heard of the Many-faced
Tribe of Bunjâras? I am of them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130462">'Lie not, Jhungi!' interrupted Tiddu calmly, 'he is but my
apprentice, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, but I--' he paused, caught
up a cloth, gave it one dexterous twirl round him, squatted down, and
there he was, to the life, a veiled woman watching the stranger with
furtive, modest eye. 'But I,' came a round feminine voice full of the
feminine inflections, 'am of the thousand-faced people who wander to a
thousand places. A new place, a new face. It makes a large world, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, a strange world.' There was a melancholy
cadence in his voice, which added interest to the sheer amaze which
Jim Douglas was feeling. He had heard the legend of the Many-faced
Tribe, had even seen clever actors claiming to belong to it, and knew
how the Stranglers deceived their victims, but anything like this he
had never credited, much less seen. He himself, though he knew to the
contrary, could scarcely combat the conviction, which seemed to come
to him from that one furtive eye, that a woman sat within those
folds.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130463">'But how?' he began in perplexity, 'I thought the Baharupas<ref target="#fswatern64">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern64" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth"><hi rend="italic">Lit.</hi> many faced.</note> never went in caravans.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130464">Tiddu resumed the cracked voice and let the smile become visible,
and, as if by magic, the illusion disappeared. 'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> is right. We are wanderers. But in my youth
a woman tied me to one place one face; women have the trick, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, even if they are wanderers themselves. This
one was, but I loved her; so after we had burnt her and her
fellow-wanderer together hand-in-hand, according to the custom, so
that they might wander elsewhere but not in the tribe, I lingered
on. He was the father of Jhungi, and the boy being left destitute I
taught him to play; for it needs two in the play as in life--the man
and the woman, or folks care not for it. So I taught Jhungi--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130465">'And brother Bhungi?' suggested his hearer dryly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130467">A faint chuckle came from the veil. 'And Bhungi. He plays well, and
hath beguiled an old rascal with thin legs and<pb xml:id="fswater_130466" n="65 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/> a fat face like mine into playing with him. Some,
even the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> himself, might be beguiled into
mistaking Siddu for Tiddu. But it is a tom-cat to a tiger. So, being
warned, the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> will give no unearned blows;
yet if he did, are not two kicks bearable from the milch-cow?' As he
spoke he angled out a hand impudently for an alms with the beggars'
cry of '<hi rend="italic">Alakh</hi>,' to point his meaning.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130468">It was echoed by Jhungi, who, envious of Tiddu's holding the
boards, as it were, had in sheer devilry and desire not to be outdone,
taken up the disguise of a mendicant. It was a most creditable
performance, but Tiddu dismissed it with a waive of the hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130469">'<hi rend="italic">Bullah</hi>!' he said, contemptuously, ''tis the
refuge of fools, There is not one true beggar in fifty, so the
forty-and-nine false ones go free of detention as the potter's
donkey. Even the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> could do better--had I
the teaching of him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130470">He leant forward, dropping his voice slightly, and Jim Douglas
narrowed his eyes as men do when some unbidden idea claims admittance
to the brain.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130471">'You?' he echoed; 'what could you teach me?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130472">Tiddu rose, let fall the veil to decent dignified drapery, and
fixed his eyes full on the questioner. They were luminous eyes,
differing from Jhungi's beady ones, as the fire-opal differs from the
diamond.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130473">'What could I teach?' he re-echoed, and his tone, monotonously
distinct to Jim Douglas, seemed inaudible to others, judging by
Jhungi's impassive face. 'Many things. For one, that the Baharupas are
not mimics only; they have the Great Art. What is it? God knows. But
what they will folk to see, that is seen; that and no more.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130474">Jim Douglas laughed derisively. Animal magnetism and mesmerism were
one thing: this was another.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130475">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> thinks I lie; but he must have
heard of the doctor <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> in Calcutta who made
suffering forget to suffer.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130476">'You mean Dr. Easdale.<ref target="#fswatern65">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern65" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">Who started the
Mesmeric Hospital.</note> Did you know him? Was he a pupil of yours?'
came the cynical question.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130478">Tiddu's face became expressionless. 'Perhaps; but this slave
forgets names. Yet the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> have the Gift
sometimes; the Baharupas have it not always--though the father's hoard
goes oftenest to the son. Now, if, by chance, the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> had the gift and could use it, there would
be no<pb xml:id="fswater_130477" n="66 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> need for policemen to
salute as he passes; no need for the drug-smokers to cease babbling
when he enters. So the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> could find out
what he wants to find out; what he is paid to find out.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130479">His eyes met Jim Douglas' surprise boldly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130480">'How do you know I want to find out anything?' asked the latter,
after a pause.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130481">Tiddu laughed. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> must find a turban
heavy, and there is no room for English toes in a native shoe; folk
seek not such discomfort for naught.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130482">Jim Douglas paused again; the fellow was a charlatan, but he was
consummately clever; and if there was anything certain in this world
it was the wisdom of forgetting Western prejudices occasionally in
dealing with the East.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130483">'Send that man away,' he said curtly, 'I want to talk to you
alone.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130484">But the request seemed lost on Tiddu. He folded up the veil
impudently, and resumed the thread of the former topic.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130485">'Yet Jhungi plays the beggar well, for which Fate be praised, since
he must ask alms elsewhere if the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>
refuses them; for the purse is empty,'--here he took a leathern bag
from his waistband and turned it inside out--'by reason of the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> dislike to good mimics. So thou must to
the temples, Jhungi, and if thou meetest Bhungi give him the <hi rend="italic">sahib's</hi> generous gift; for blows should not be
taken on loan.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130486">Jhungi, who all this time had been telling his beads like the best
of beggars, looked up with some perplexity; whether real or assumed
Jim Douglas, in that hotbed of deception, felt it was impossible to
say.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130487">'Bhungi?' echoed the former, rising to his feet. 'Ay! that will I,
if I meet him. But God knows as to that. God knows if Bhungi--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130488">'The purse is empty,' repeated Tiddu in a warning voice, and
Jhungi, with a laugh, pulled himself and his disguise together, as it
were, and passed out of the tent; his beggar's cry, '<hi rend="italic">Alakh! Alakh!</hi>' growing fainter and fainter while
Tiddu and Jim Douglas looked at each other.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130489">'Jhungi-Bhungi-Bhungi-Jhungi,' jeered the Baharupa, suddenly,
jingling the names together. 'Which be which, as he said, God knows,
not man. That is the best of lies. They last a body's lifetime, so the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> may as well learn old Tiddu's--'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130490" n="67 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/><p xml:id="fswater_130491">'Or Siddu's ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130492">'Or Siddu's,' assented the mountebank, calmly. 'But the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> cannot learn to use his Gift from that old
rascal. He must come to the Many-faced one, who is ready to teach
it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130493">'Why?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130494">Tiddu abandoned mystery at once.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130495">'For fifty rupees, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>; not a <hi rend="italic">pice</hi> less; now, in my hand.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130496">Was it worth it? Jim Douglas decided instantly that it might
be. Not for the Gift's sake; of that he was incredulous; but Tiddu was
a consummate actor and could teach many tricks worth knowing. Then in
this roving commission to report on anything he saw and heard to the
military magnate, it would suit him for the time to have the service
of an arrant scoundrel. Besides, the pay promised him being but small,
the wisdom of having a second string to the bow of ambition had
already decided him on combining inquiry with judicious horse-dealing;
since he could thus wander through villages buying, through towns
selling, without arousing suspicion; and this life in a caravan would
start him on these lines effectively. Finally, this offer of Tiddu's
was unsought, unexpected, and, ever since Kate Erlton's appeal, Jim
Douglas had felt a strange attraction towards pure chance. So he took
out a note from his pocket-book and laid it in the Baharupa's
hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130497">'You asked fifty,' he said, 'I give a hundred; but with the branch
of the <hi rend="italic">neem</hi>-tree between us two.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130498">Tiddu gave him an admiring look. 'With the sacred "<hi rend="italic">Lim ke dagla</hi>" between us, and Mighty Murri-am
herself to see it grow,' he echoed. 'Is the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> satisfied ?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130500">The Englishman knew enough of Bunjâra oaths to be sure that
he had, at least, the cream of them; besides, a hundred rupees went
far in the purchase of good faith. So that matter was settled, and he
felt it to be a distinct relief, for during the last day or two he had
been casting about for a fair start rather aimlessly. In truth, he had
underrated the gap little Zora's death would make in his life, and had
been in a way bewildered to find himself haunting the empty nest on
the terraced roof in forlorn, sentimental fashion. The sooner,
therefore, that he left Lucknow the better. So, as the Bunjâra
had told him the caravan was starting the very next morning, he
hastily completed his few preparations, and having sent Tara word of
his intention, went, after the moon had<pb xml:id="fswater_130499" n="68 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> risen, to lock the doors on the past idyll and take the
key of the garden-house back to its owner; for he himself had always
lodged, in European fashion, near the Palace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130501">The garden, as he entered it, lay peaceful as ever; so utterly
unchanged from what he remembered it on many balmy moonlit nights,
that he could not help looking up once more, as if expectant of that
tinsel flutter, that soft welcome, '<hi rend="italic">Khushdâmudund Huzrut.</hi>' Strange! So far as he
was concerned the idyll might be beginning; but for her? All
unconsciously, as he paused, his thought found answer in one spoken
word--the Persian equivalent for 'it is finished,' which has such a
finality in its short syllable--'<hi rend="smallcaps">KHUTM.'</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_130502">'<hi rend="italic">Khutm.</hi>' The echo came from Tara's voice,
but it had a ring in it which made him turn, anticipating some
surprise. She was standing not far off, below the plinth as he was,
having stepped out from the shadow of the trees at his approach, and
she was swathed from head to foot in the white veil of orthodox
widowhood, which encircled her face like a cere-cloth. Even in the
moonlight he could see the excitement in her face, the glitter in the
large, wild eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130503">'Tara!' he exclaimed sharply, his experience warning him of danger,
'what does this mean?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130504">'That the end has come; the end at last,' she cried, theatrically,
every fold of her drapery, though she stood stiff as a corpse, seeming
to be instinct with fierce vitality.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130505">He changed his tone at once, perceiving that the danger might be
serious. 'You mean that your service is at an end,' he said
quietly. 'I told you that some days ago. Also that your pay would be
continued because of your goodness to her--to the dead. I advised your
returning north, nearer your own people, but you are free to go or
stay. Do you want anything more? If you do, be quick, please, for I am
in a hurry.' His coolness, his failure to remark on the evident
meaning of her changed dress, calmed her somewhat.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130507">'I want nothing,' she replied sullenly. 'A <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> wants nothing in this world, and I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. I have been the master's servant for
gratitude's sake--now I am the servant of God for righteousness'
sake.' So far she had spoken as if the dignified words had been
pre-arranged; now she paused in a sort of wistful anger at the
indifference on his face. The words meant so much to her, and, as she
ceased from them, their controlling power seemed to pass also, and<pb xml:id="fswater_130506" n="69 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/> she flung out her arms wildly,
then brought them down in stinging blows upon her breasts.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130508">'I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. Yes! I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>! Reject me not again, ye Shining Ones!
reject me not again.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130509">The cry was full of exalted resolve and despair. It made Jim
Douglas step up to her, and seizing both hands, hold them fast.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130510">'Don't be a fool, Tara!' he said sternly. 'Tell me, sensibly, what
all this means. Tell me what you are going to do.' His touch seemed to
scorch her, for she tore herself away from it vehemently; yet it
seemed also to quiet her, and she watched him with sombre eyes for a
minute ere replying.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130511">'I am going to Holy Gunga. Where else should a <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> go? The Water will not reject me as the Fire
did, since, before God! I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. As the
master knows'--her voice held a passionate appeal,--'I have been <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> all these long years. Yet now I have given
up all--all!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130512">With a swift gesture, full of womanly grace, but with a sort of
protest against such grace in its utter abandonment and
self-forgetfulness, she flung out her arms once more. This time to
raise the shrouding veil from her head and shoulders. Against this
background of white gleaming in the moonlight, her new-shaven skull
showed death-like, ghastly. Jim Douglas recoiled a step, not from the
sight itself, but because he knew its true meaning; knew that it meant
self-immolation if she were left to follow her present bent. She would
simply go down to the Ganges and drown herself. An inconceivable state
of affairs, beyond all rational understanding; but to be reckoned
with, nevertheless, as real, inevitable.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130513">'What a pity!' he said, after a moment's pause had told him that it
would be well to try and take the starch out of her resolution by fair
means or foul, leaving its cause for future inquiry. 'You had such
nice hair. I used to admire it very much.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130514">Her hands fell slowly, a vague terror and amaze came to her
eyes. He pursued the advantage remorselessly. 'Why did you cut it
off?' He knew of course, but his affected ignorance took the colour,
the intensity from the situation, by making her feel her <hi rend="italic">coup de théâtre</hi> had failed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130516">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> must know,' she faltered, anger
and dis<pb xml:id="fswater_130515" n="70 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>appointment and vague
doubt in her tone, while her right hand drew itself over the shaven
skull as if to make sure there was no mistake. 'I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>--' the familiar word seemed to bring
certainty with it, and she went on more confidentially. 'So I cut it
all off and it lies there, ready, as I am, for purification.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130517">She pointed to the upper step leading to the plinth where, as on an
altar, lay all her worldly treasures, arranged carefully with a view
to effect. The crimson scarf she had always worn was folded--with due
regard to the display of its embroidered edge--as a cloth, and at
either end of it lay a pile of trumpery personal adornments, each
topped and redeemed from triviality by a gold wristlet and anklet. In
the centre, set round by fallen orange-blossoms rose a great heap of
black hair, snakelike in glistening coils. The simple pomposity of the
arrangement was provocative of smiles, the wistful eagerness of the
face watching its effect on the master was provocative of tears. Jim
Douglas feeling inclined for both, chose the former deliberately; he
even managed a derisive laugh as he stepped up to the altar and laid
sacrilegious hands on the hair. Tara gave a cry of dismay, but he was
too quick for her, and dangled a long lock before her very eyes, in
jesting, but stern decision.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130518">'That settles it, Tara. You can go to Gunga now if you like, and
bathe and be as holy as you like. But there will be no Fire or
Water. Do you understand?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130519">She looked at the hand holding the hair with the oddest expression,
though she said obstinately, 'I shall drown if I choose.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130520">'Why should you choose?' he asked. 'You know as well as I that it
is too late for any good to you or others. The Fire or Water should
have come twelve years ago. The priests won't say so of course. They
want fools to help them in this fuss about the new law. Ah! I thought
so! They have been at you, have they? Well, be a fool if you like, and
bring them pennies at Benares as a show. You cannot do anything
else. You can't even sacrifice your hair really, so long as I have
this bit--' He began to roll the lock round his finger, neatly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130521">'What is the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> going to do with it?'
she asked, and the oddness had invaded her voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130523">'Keep it,' he retorted. 'And by all those thirty thousand<pb xml:id="fswater_130522" n="71 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/> and odd gods of yours, I'll say it
was a love-token if I choose. And I will if you are a fool.' He drew
out a small gold locket attached to the Brahminical thread he always
wore, and began methodically to fit the curl into it, wondering if
this cantrip of his--for it was nothing more--would impress
Tara. Possibly. He had found such suggestions of ritual had an immense
effect, especially with the women-kind who were for ever inventing new
shackles for themselves; but her next remark startled him
considerably.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130524">'Is the <hi rend="italic">bibi's</hi> hair in there too?' she
asked. There was a real anxiety in her tone, and he looked at her
sharply, wondering what she would be at.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130525">'No,' he answered. In truth it was empty; and had been empty ever
since he had taken a fair curl from it many years before--a curl which
had ruined his life. The memory making him impatient of all feminine
subtleties, he added roughly, 'It will stay there for the present; but
if you try <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> nonsense I swear I'll tie it
up in a cowskin bag, and give it to a sweeper to make broth of.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130526">The grotesque threat, which suggested itself to his sardonic humour
as one suitable to the occasion, and which in sober earnest was
terrible to one of her race, involving as it did eternal damnation,
seemed to pass her by. There was even, he fancied, a certain relief in
the face watching him complete his task; almost a smile quivering
about her lips. But when he closed the locket with a snap, and was
about to slip it back to its place, the full meaning of the threat, of
the loss--of of something beyond these--seemed to overtake her; an
unmistakable terror, horror, and despair swept through her. She flung
herself at his feet, clasping them with both hands.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130527">'Give it me back, master,' she pleaded wildly. 'Hinder me not
again! Before God I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>! I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130528">But this same Eastern clutch of appeal is disconcerting to the
average Englishman. It fetters the understanding in another sense, and
smothers sympathy in a desire to be left alone. Even Jim Douglas
stepped back from it with something like a bad word. She remained
crouching for a moment with empty hands, then rose in scornful
dignity.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130530">'There was no need to thrust this slave away,' she said
proudly. 'Tara, the Rajputni, will go without that. She will go to
Holy Gunga and be purged of inmost sin. Then<pb xml:id="fswater_130529" n="72 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> she will return and claim her right of <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> at the master's hand. Till then he may keep
what he stole.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130531">'He means to keep it,' retorted the master savagely, for he had
come to the end of his patience. 'Though what this fuss about <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> means I don't know. You used to be sensible
enough. What has come to you?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130532">Tara looked at him helplessly, then wrapping her widow's veil round
her, prepared to go in silence. She could not answer that question
even to herself. She would not even admit the truth of the old
tradition, that the only method for a woman to preserve constancy to
the dead was to seek death itself. That would be to admit too
much. Yet that was the truth, to which her despair at parting pointed,
even to herself. Truth? No! it was a lie! She would disprove it in
life, if she was prevented from doing so by death. So, without a word,
she gathered up the crimson drapery and what lay on it; then with
these pathetic sacrifices of all the womanhood she knew tight clasped
in her widow's veil, she paused for a last salaam.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130533">The incomprehensible tragedy of her face irritated him into greater
insistence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130534">'But what is it all about?' he reiterated. 'Who has been putting
these ideas into your head? Who has been telling you to do this? Is it
Soma, or some devil of a priest?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130535">As he waited for an answer the floods of moonlight threw their
shadows together to join the perfumed darkness of the orange trees:
the city, half asleep already, sent no sound to invade the
silence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130536">'No! master. It was God.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130537">Then the shadow left his and disappeared with her among the
trees. He did not try to call her back. That answer left him
helpless.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130539">But as, after climbing the stairs, he passed slowly from one to
another of the old familiar places in the pleasant pavilions, the
mystery of such womanhood as Tara Devi's and little Zora's oppressed
him. Their eternal cult of purely physical passion, their eternal
struggle for perfect purity and constancy, not of the soul, but the
body, their worship, alike of sex and He who made it, seemed
incomprehensible. And as he turned the key in the lock for the last
time, he felt glad to think that it was not likely the problem would
come into his life again despite the long lock of black hair he
carried with<pb xml:id="fswater_130538" n="73 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/> him. It was an odd
keepsake, but if he was any judge of faces, his cantrip had served his
purpose, and Tara would not commit suicide while he held that
hostage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130540">So, having scant leisure left, he hurried through the alleys to
return the key. They were almost deserted; the children at this hour
being asleep, the men away lounging in the bazaars. But every now and
again a formless white figure clung to a corner shadow to let him
pass, a white shadow itself, recalling the mystery he had been glad to
leave unsolved; for he knew these were women taking this only
opportunity for a neighbourly visit. Old or young, pretty or ugly?
What did it matter? They were women, born temptresses of virtuous men,
and they were proud of the fact; even the poor old things long past
their youth! There was a chink in a door he was about to pass; a chink
an inch wide with a white shadow behind it. A woman was looking
out. What sort of a woman he wondered idly? Suddenly the chink
widened, a hand crept through it, beckoning. He could see it clearly
in the moonlight; an old wrinkled hand, delicately old, delicately
wrinkled, inconceivably thin, but with the pink henna stain of the
temptress still on palm and fingers. A hand with the whole history of
seclusion written on it. He crossed over to it, and heard a hurried
breathless whisper.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130541">'If the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> would listen for the sake of
any woman he loves.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130542">It was an old voice, but it sent a thrill to his heart. 'I am
listening, mother,' he replied, 'for the sake of the dead.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130543">'God send her grave peace, my son!' came the voice less
hurriedly. 'It is not much for listening. I am pensioner, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. The king gave me three rupees, but now he
is gone and the money comes not. If the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>
would tell those who send it that
Ashrâf-un-Nissa-Zainub-i-Mahal--the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> may know my name, being as my father and
mother--wants it. That is all, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130544">It was not much, but Jim Douglas could supplement the rest. Here
was evidently a woman who had lived on bounty, and who was starving
for the lack of it. There were hundreds in her position, he knew, even
amongst those whose pensions had been guaranteed; for they had not
been paid as yet. The papers were not ready, the tape not tied, the
sealing wax not sealed.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130545" n="74 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130546">'It will not be for long, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, and it is
only three rupees. I was watching for a neighbour to borrow corn, if I
could, and seeing the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130547">'It is all right, mother,' he interrupted reassuringly. 'I was
coming to pay it. Hold the hand straight and I will count it in. Three
rupees for three months; that is nine.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130548">The chink of the silver had a background of blessings, and Jim
Douglas walked on, thinking what a quaint commentary this little
incident was on his puzzle. 'Ashrâf-un Nissa-Zainub-i-Mahal.'
'Honour-of-women and Ornament-of-Palaces.' If the King-paymaster had
thought twice about such things, the poor old lady might not have been
starving. He was the real culprit; for three months' delay was not
long for sanctions, references, for all the paraphernalia and complex
machinery of our Government. But a case like this did infinite
harm. He looked up into the star-sprinkled riband of sky between the
narrowing housetops, and wondered from how many unseen hearths and
unheard voices the cry, '<hi rend="italic">How long, oh Lord! How
long</hi>,' was rising? But even to his listening ear there was no
sign, no sound; and as he went on through the bazaars, the crowds were
passing and repassing contentedly upon the trivial errands of life,
and the twinkling cressets in the shops showed faces eager only after
a trivial loss or gain.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130549">And the world of Lucknow was apparently awakening contentedly to a
new day, when, before dawn, he passed out of it disguised by Tiddu as
a deaf-and-dumb driver to the bullock which carried the tattered
bell-tent and the tattered staff uniform. It was still dark, but there
was a sense of light in the sky, and the hum of the housewives
quern's, early at work over the coming day's bread, filled the air
like swarming bees. The spectral white shadows of widow-drudges were
already at work on the creaking well-gear, and the swish of their reed
brooms could be heard behind screening walls.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130550">But on the broad white road beyond the bazaars the fresh perfume of
the dew-steeped gardens drifted with the faint breeze which heralds
the dawn. And down the road, heard first, then dimly seen against its
whiteness, came a band of chanting pilgrims to the Holy River.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130551">'<hi rend="italic">Hurri Gunga! Hurri Gunga! Hurri Gunga!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130553">Jim Douglas, swerving his bullock to give them room,<pb xml:id="fswater_130552" n="75 THE GIFT OF MANY FACES"/> wondered if Tara were amongst them. What if
she were? That lock of her hair went with him. So, with a smile, he
swerved the bullock back again. There was a hint of a gleaming
river-curve through the lessening trees now, and that big black mass
to his left must be the Bailey-guard gate. He could see a faint white
streak like a sentry beside it, so it must be close on gunfire. Even
as the thought came, a sudden rolling boom filled the silence, and
seemed to vibrate against the archway. And hark! from within the
Residency, and from far Dilkhusha, the clear glad notes of the <hi rend="italic">reveillée</hi> answered the challenge, while
close at hand the clash of arms told they were changing
guards. Then--though he could not see it--the English flag must be
rising beyond the trees to float over the city during the coming
day.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130554">For one day more, at least!</p></div></div><pb xml:id="fswater_130555" n="[76]"/><div xml:id="fswater_0200" n="2" type="book"><head>BOOK II <lb/><hi rend="italic">THE BLOWING OF THE
BUBBLE</hi></head><div xml:id="fswater_0201" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I<lb/>IN THE PALACE</head><p xml:id="fswater_130556">IT was a day in late September. Nearly six months, therefore, had
gone by since Jim Douglas had passed the Bailey-guard at gunfire, and
the English flag had risen behind the trees to float over Lucknow. It
floated there now, serenely, securely, with an air of finality in its
folds; for folk were becoming accustomed to it. At least so said the
official reports, and even Jim Douglas himself could trace no waxing
in the tide of discontent; it neither ebbed nor flowed, but beat
placidly against the rocks of offence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130557">But at Delhi there was one corner of the city over which the
English flag did not float. It lay upon the eastern side above the
river, where four rose-red fortress walls hemmed in a few acres of
earth from the march of Time himself, and safe-guarded a strange
survival of sovereignty in the person of Bahâdur Shâh,
last of the Moghuls; an old man past eighty years of age, who dreamt a
dream of power among the golden domes, marble colonnades, and green
gardens, with which his ancestors had crowned the eastern wall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130558">The sun shone hotly, steamily, within those four enclosing walls,
save on that eastern edge where the cool breezes from the plains
beyond, blew through open arches and latticed balconies. For the rest,
the palace-fort--shut in from all outside influence--was like some
tepid, teeming breeding-place for strange forms of life unknown to
purer, clearer atmospheres.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130560">It was at the Lahore gate of this Delhi palace, that on this late
September day a tawdry palanquin, followed by a few<pb xml:id="fswater_130559" n="77 IN THE PALACE"/> tawdry retainers, paused before a cavernous arch ending
the quaint lofty vaulted tunnel which led inwards for some fifty yards
or more to another barrier. Here an old man in spectacles sat writing
hurriedly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130561">'Quick, fool, quick! Read, and let me sign,' called the huge
unwieldy figure in the palanquin, as the bearers, panting under their
gross burden, shifted shoulders. Mahboob Ali, Chief Eunuch and Prime
Minister, groaned under the jolt; it was a foretaste of many to be
endured ere he reached the Resident's house, miles away on the
northern edge of the river. Yet he had to endure them, for important
negotiations were on foot between the Survival and Civilization. The
heir-apparent to those few acres where the sun stood still had died,
had been poisoned some said; and another had to be recognised. There
was no lack of claimants; there never was a lack of claimants to
anything within those walls, where every one strove to have the first
and last word with the Civilization which supported the Survival. And
here was he, Mahboob, Prime Minister, being delayed by a miserable
scrivener!</p><p xml:id="fswater_130562">'Read, pig! read,' he reiterated, laying his puffy hand on his
jewelled sword-hilt; for he was still within the gate, therefore a
despot. A few yards further he would be a dropsical old man; no
more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130563">'Your slave reads!' faltered the editor of the Court
Journal. 'Mussamât Hâfzan's record of the
women's-apartments being late to-day, hath delayed--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130564">''Twas in time enough, uncle, if thou wouldst make fewer
flourishes,' retorted a woman's voice; it was nothing but a voice by
reason of the voluminous Pathan veil covering the small speaker.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130565">'Curse thee for a misbegotten hound!' bawled Mahboob. 'Am I to lose
the entrance fee I paid Gâmu, the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> orderly for first interview--when money is
so scarce too! Read as it stands, idiot--'tis but an idle tale at
best.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130567">The last was an aside to himself as he lay back in his cushions;
for, idle though the tale was undoubtedly, it suited him to be its
Prime Minister. The editor laid down his pen hurreidly, and the
polished Persian polysyllables began to trip over one another, while
their murmurous echo--as if eager to escape the familiar
monotony--sped from arch to arch of the long tunnel, which was lit
about the<pb xml:id="fswater_130566" n="78 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> middle by side
arches through which the sunlight streamed in a broad band of gold
across the red stone causeway.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130568">The attributes of the Almighty having come to an end the reader
began on those of Bahâdur Shâh, Father of Victory, Light
of Religion, Polestar and Defender of the Faith--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130569">'Faster, fool, faster,' came the fat voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130570">The spectacled old man swallowed his breath, as it were, and went
on at full gallop through the uprisal and bathing of Majesty, through
feelings of pulses and reception of visitors, then slowed down a bit
over the recital of dinner; for he was a gourmet, and his tongue loved
the very sound of dainty dishes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130571">'May your grave be spat upon!' shouted the Chief Eunuch. 'So none
were poisoned by it what matters the food? Pass on--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130572">'The Most Exalted then said his appointed prayers, gasped the
reader. 'The Light-of-the-World then slept his usual sleep. On
awakening, the physician Ahsan-Oolah--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130573">Mahboob sat up among his cushions. 'Ahsan-Oolah! he felt the Royal
pulse at dawn also--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130574">'The Most Noble forgets,' interrupted a voice with the veiled venom
of a partisan in its suavity. 'The King--may his enemies die!--took a
cooling draught yesterday and requires all the care we can give
him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130575">'The King, Meean-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, needs nothing save
the prayers of the holy priest, who has piously made over long years
of his own life to prolong his Majesty's,' retorted Mahboob, scowling
at the speaker who wore the Moghul dress, proclaiming him a member of
the royal family. There was no lack of such in the palace-fort, for
though Bahâdur Shâh himself, being more or less of a
saint, had contented himself with some sixty children, his ancestors
had sometimes run to six hundred.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130576">The Meean-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> laughed scornfully as he
passed inwards, and muttered that those who went forth with the dog's
trot might return with the cat's slink, since the great question had
yet to be settled. Mahboob's scowl deepened, the very audacity of the
interruption rousing a fear lest the king's eldest son, Mirza Moghul,
whose partisan the speaker was, might have some secret understanding
with Civilisation. All the more need for haste.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130577">'Read on, fool! Who told thee to stop?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130578" n="79 IN THE PALACE"/><p xml:id="fswater_130579">'The Princess Farkhoonda Zamâni entered by the Delhi
gate--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130580">Mahboob gave a scornful laugh in his turn. 'To visit the Mirza's
house, no doubt. Let her come--a pretty fool! Yet she had wiser stay
where she hath chosen to live, instead of being princess one day and
plain Newâsi the next. There are enough women without her in the
palace!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130581">So it seemed, to judge by the stream of female names and titles
belonging to the curtained dhoolies which had passed and repassed the
barriers, upon which the editor launched his tongue; but Mahboob, as
Chief Eunuch, knew the value of such information and cut it short with
a sneer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130582">'If that be all! quick! the pen, and I will sign.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130583">A bystander, also in the Moghul dress, laughed broadly at the
well-worn inuendo on the possibilities of curtained dhoolies in
intrigue. 'Thou art right, Mahboob,' he said, 'God only knows--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130584">'His own work,' chuckled the Keeper of Virtue. 'And the Devil made
most of the women here. Now pigs! Can'st not start? Am I to be kept
here all day?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130585">As the litter went swaying out between the presented arms of the
sentries, the white chrysalis of a Pathan veil stepped lamely down
into the causeway. 'That, seeing there is no news, will be something
to amuse the queen withal,' came the sharp voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130586">'There may be news enough, when that fat pig returns, to make it
hard to amuse thy mistress, Mussamat Hâfzan,' suggested another
bystander.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130587">The chrysalis paused. 'My mistress! Nay, <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>! Hâfzan is that to herself only. I am
for no one save myself. I carry news, and the more the better for my
trade. Yet I have not had a real good day for gifts of gratitude from
my hearers, since Prince Fukrud-deen the heir-apparent, died.' There
was a reckless cynicism in her voice, and he of the Moghul dress broke
in hotly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130588">'Was poisoned, thou meanest, by--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130589">Hâfzan's shrill laugh rang through the arches.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130590">'No names, Mirza-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, no names! And 'tis
no news surely to have folk poisoned in the fort; as thou wouldst know
ere long, may be, if Hâfzan were spiteful. But I name no
names--not I! I carry news, that is all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130592">So, with a limp, showing that the woman within was a<pb xml:id="fswater_130591" n="80 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> cripple, the formless figure passed along
the tunnel through the inner barrier, and so across the wide courtyard
where the public hall of audience stood blocking the eastern end. It
was a massive, square, one-storied building, with a remorseless look
in its plain expanse of dull red stone, pierced by toothed arches
which yawned darkly into a redder gloom, like monstrous mouths agape
for victims. Past this, with its high-set fretted marble <hi rend="italic">baldequin</hi> showing dimly against the end
wall--whence a locked wicket gave sole entrance from the palace to
this seat of justice or injustice--the Pathan veil flitted like a
ghost; so, through a narrow passage guarded by the king's own
body-guard, into a different world--a cool breezy world of white and
gold, and blue, clasping a garden set with flowers and fruit, with
blue sky, white marble colonnades, and golden domes vaulting and
zoning the burnished leaves of the orange trees, where the green fruit
hung like emeralds above a tangle of roses and marigolds,
chrysanthemums and crimson amaranth. Hâfzan paused among them
for a second; then, all unchallenged by any, passed on up the steps of
the marble platform, which lies between the Baths and the Private Hall
of Audience; that marvellous building where the legend, cunningly
circled into the decorations, still tells the visitor again and again
that, '<hi rend="italic">If earth holds a haven of bliss, It is this,
it is this, it is this</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130593">Here on the platform, Hâfzan paused again to look over the
low parapet. The wide eastern plains stretched away to the pale blue
horizon before her, and the curving river lay at her feet edging the
high bank faced with stone, which forms the eastern defence of the
palace-fort. Thus the levels of the ground within touch the very top
of the wall, so that the domes and colonnades and green gardens, when
seen from the opposite side of the stream, cut clear upon the sky,
like a castle in the air at all times; but in the sunsettings, when
they show in shades of pale lilac, with the huge dome of the great
mosque bulging like a big bubble into the golden light behind them, as
a veritable Palace-of-Dreams.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130595">She looked northward, first, along the sheer face of the rosy
retaining wall to its trend westward at the Queen's favourite bastion,
where a balconied summer-house was set overhanging the moat between
the fort itself and the isolated citadel of Selimgarh; which, jutting
out into the<pb xml:id="fswater_130594" n="81 IN THE PALACE"/> river, partially hid the
bridge of boats spanning the stream beyond. Then she looked
southward. Here was the sheer face of rosy wall again, but it was
crowned close at hand by the colonnade and projecting eaves of the
Private Hall of Audience. Further on it was broken by the carved <hi rend="italic">corbeilles</hi> of the king's balcony, and it ended
abruptly at a sudden eastward turn of the river, so giving a view of
rolling rocky hillocks sweeping up to the horizon where--faint and far
like a spear-point--the column of the Kutb showed on a clear day. The
Kutb! That splendid promise, never fulfilled--that first minaret of
the great mosque that never was, and never will be built--that symbol
of the undying dream of Mohammedan supremacy that never came, that
never can come to pass.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130596">As she paused, a troop of women laden with cosmetics and combs and
quaint baskets containing endless aids to beauty, came shuffling out
of the baths, gossiping and chattering shrilly, and clanking heavy
anklets as they came. And with them, a heavy perfumed stream
suggestive of warm indolence, luxury, sensuality, passed out into the
garden.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130597">'What! done already?' called Hâfzan in surprise.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130598">'Already!' echoed a bold-faced trollop pertly, '<hi rend="italic">Ari</hi>, sister, Art grown a loose-liver? Sure this is
Friday, and the King, good man, bathes apart, religiously! So we be
religious too, matching his humour. That is the way with us
women!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130599">An answering giggle met the sally.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130600">'Thou art an impudent hussy, Goloo!' said Hâfzan
angrily. 'And the Queen--where is she?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130601">'In the mosque praying for patience--in the summerhouse playing
games--in the King's room coaxing him to belief--in the vestibule
feeding her son with lollipops--he likes them big, and sweet, and
lively, and of his own choosing does the prince, as I know to my
cost.' Here a general titter broke in on the unabashed recital.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130602">'<hi rend="italic">Loh!</hi> leave Hâfzan to find out what the queen does
elsewhere,' suggested another voice. 'We speak not of such
things.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130603">'Then speak lower of others,' retorted Hâfzan. 'Walls have
echoes, sister, and thy mistress would fare no better than others if
thy talk reached Zeenut Maihl's ears.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130605">'Tell her, spy! if thou wilt,' replied the woman<pb xml:id="fswater_130604" n="82 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> carelessly. 'We have friends on our side
now, as thou mayst understand mayhap ere nightfall when the answer
comes.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130606">Hâfzan laughed. 'Thou hast more faith in friends than I. <hi rend="italic">Loh</hi>! I trust none within these four walls. And out
of them but few.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130607">So saying she limped back into the garden, giving a glance as she
passed it into the Pearl Mosque, which showed like a carven snowdrift
against the blue of the sky, the green of the trees. Finding none
there, she went straight to the Queen's favourite summer-house on the
northern bastion. It was a curious fatality which made Zeenut Maihl
choose it, since all her arts, all her cunning, could scarcely have
told her that it would ere long be a watch-tower, whence the chance of
success or failure could be counted. For the white road beyond the
bridge of boats, and trending eastward to the packed population of
Oude, to Lucknow, to all that remained of vitality in the Mohammedan
dream, was to be ere long like a living growing branch to which she,
the spider, hung by an invisible thread spinning her cobwebs,
seemingly in mid-air.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130609">'Hush!' The whispered monition made Hâfzan pause in the
screened archway till the game was over. It was a sort of dumb crambo,
and a most outrageous <hi rend="italic">double entendre</hi> had just
brought a smile to the broad heavy face of a woman who lay among
cushions in the alcoved balcony. This was Zeenut Maihl, who for nearly
twenty years had kept her hold upon the King, despite endless
rivals. She was dark-complexioned, small-eyed, with a curious lack of
eyebrows which took from her even vivacity of expression. But it was a
man with experience in many wives who remarked that favour is
deceitful and beauty is vain, for he knew, no doubt, that in polygamy,
the victory always goes to the most unscrupulous fighter. Zeenut
Maihl, at any rate, secured hers by ever-recurring promises of an
another heir to her octogenarian husband; a flattery to which his
other wives either could not or would not stoop. But the trick served
the Queen's purpose in more ways than one. Her oft-recurring
disappointments could have but one cause--witchcraft; so on such
occasions, with her paid priest, Hussan Askuri, saying prayers for
those <hi rend="italic">in extremis</hi> at her bedside, Zeenut
Maihl's enemies went down like nine-pins, and she rose from her bed of
sickness with a board<pb xml:id="fswater_130608" n="83 IN THE PALACE"/> cleared of
dangerous rivalry. For none in that hot-bed of shams felt secure
enough to get into grips with her. Ahsan-Oolah the physician might
have--she had cried quarter from his keen fence before now--but he did
not care to take the trouble; for he was a philosopher, content to let
his world go to the devil its own way, so long as it did not interfere
with his passionate greed of gold. And this master-passion being
shared by Zeenut Maihl they hoisted the flag of truce for the most
part against mutual spoliations. So the Queen played her game
unmolested, as she played dumb-crambo; at which her servants,
separated like their betters into cliques, tried to out-do each
other.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130610">'<hi rend="italic">Wâh!</hi>' said the set who were jubilant
over the <hi rend="italic">double entendre</hi>. 'That is the best
to-day.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130611">'If you like it, a clod is a betel nut,' retorted the leader of
another set, 'I'll wager to beat it easily.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130612">The Queen frowned. There was too much freedom in this speech of
Fâtma's to suit her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130613">'And I will be the judge,' she said with a cruel smile, 'since
Fâtma must be taught better manners.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130614">Fâtma--a woman older than the rest--salaamed calmly; and the
fact made the other clique look at each other uneasily. What certainty
gave her such confidence as she plucked a grey hair from her own head,
and placed it on the black velvet cushion which lay at the Queen's
feet?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130615">'That is my riddle,' she said. 'Let the world guess it, and honour
the real giver of it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130616">What could it be? Even the Queen raised herself in curiosity; a
sign in itself of commendation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130617">'Sure I know not,' she began musingly, when Fâtma sprang to
her feet in theatrical appeal.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130618">'Not so, Ornament of Palaces!' she cried. 'This may puzzle the
herd; it is plain to the mother of Princes. It lies too lowly now for
recognition, but in its proper place--' She snatched the hair from the
cushion, and, with a flourish, laid it on the head of a figure which
appeared as if by magic behind her; a figure dressed as a young Moghul
Prince, and wearing all the crown jewels.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130619">'My son, Jewan!' cried the Queen, starting angrily; the adverse
clique taking their cue from her tone shrieked modestly, and scrambled
for their veils.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130620">Fâtma salaamed to the very ground.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130621" n="84 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130622">'No! Mother of Princes, 'tis but my riddle--the heir-apparent.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130623">Zeenut Maihl paused, bewildered for an instant; then in the figure
she recognised the features of a favourite dancing girl, saw the pun,
and laughed uproariously, delightedly. The English sentry on the
drawbridge leading to Selimgurh, might have heard her had there been
one, but within the last month the right to use the citadel as a
private entry to the palace had been given to the king; for it enabled
him to cross the bridge of boats without the long circuit by the
Calcutta gate of the city.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130624">'A gold <hi rend="italic">mohur</hi> for that to Fâtma!' she
cried, 'and a post nearer my person. I need such wits sorely.' As she
spoke she rose to her feet, the smiles fading from her face as she
looked out along that white eastward streak; for the jest had brought
her back to earnest, to that mixture of personal ambition for her son,
and real patriotism for her country which kept her a restless
intriguer. 'I need men too,' she muttered. 'Not dissolute idle
weathercocks or doting old pantaloons! There are plenty of them
yonder.' So she stood for a second, then turned like lightning on her
attendants, and seeing Hâfzan, who had unveiled at the door,
she gave a cry of pleasure. ''Tis well thou hast come,' she said,
beckoning to her, 'for thou must know. God! if I were free to come and
go, what could I not compass? But here, in this smothering veil--' She
flung even the gauze apology for one which she wore from her, and
stood with smooth, bare head, and fat bare arms, her quaint little
pigtail dangling down her broad back; not a romantic figure truly, but
one in its savage temper, strength, obstinacy, to be reckoned
with. 'What time--'--she went on rapidly--'does the King receive his
initiates?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130625">'At five,' replied Hâfzan. Seen without its veil, also, her
figure showed more shrunken than ill-formed, and her pale thin face
would have been beautiful but for its look of permanent
ill-health. 'The ceremony of saintship begins then.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130626">'Saints!' echoed the Queen, with a hard laugh, 'I would make them
saints and martyrs, too, were I free. Quick, woman! pen and ink? And
stay!--Fâtma's puzzle hath driven all else from my head--What
time was't that Hussan Askuri was bidden to come?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130628">'The saintborn comes at four,' replied Hâfzan, ceremoni<pb xml:id="fswater_130627" n="85 IN THE PALACE"/>ously, 'so as to leave leisure ere the Chief
Eunuch's return with the answer.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130629">Zeenut Maihl's face was a study. 'The answer! My answer lies there
in Fâtma's riddle--take two gold <hi rend="italic">mohurs</hi>
for it, woman, it hath given me new life--Write, Hâfzan, to the
chamberlain, that the disciples must pass the southern window of the
king's private room ere they leave the palace. And call my litter; I
must see Hussan Askuri ere I meet him at the King's.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130630">An hour afterwards, with bistre marks below her eyes, and delicate
hints of causeful, becoming languor in face and figure, she was
waiting in the cluster of small dark rooms on the other side of the
marble fountain-set aqueduct which flows under a lace-like marble
screen to the very steps of the Hall of Audience; waiting the King's
return from the latticed balcony overhanging the river, where he
always spent the heats of the day.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130631">'Is all prepared?' she asked anxiously, as a glint of light from a
lifted curtain warned her of the King's approach.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130632">'All is prepared,' echoed a hollow artificial voice. The speaker
was a tall heavily-built man with long grey beard, big bushy grey
eyebrows, and narrow forehead. A dangerous man to judge by the mixed
spirituality and sensuality in his face, a man who could imagine evil,
and make himself believe it good. This was Hussan Askuri, the priest
and miracle-monger, who led the last of the Moghuls by the nose; not a
difficult task, for Bahâdur Shâh, who came tottering
across the intervening sunlit space, was but a poor creature. The
first impression he gave was of extreme old age; evident in the sparse
hair, the high hollow cheeks, the waxy skin, the purple glaze over the
eyes. The next was of a feebleness beyond even his apparent years. He
seemed fibreless, mind and body. Yet released at the door of privacy
from his eunuch's supporting hands, he ambled gaily enough to a seat,
and exclaimed vivaciously--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130633">'A moment! A moment! good priest and physician. My mind first; my
body after. The gift is on me. I feel it working, and the historian
must write of me more as poet than king.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130634">'As the king of poets, sire,' suggested Hussan Askuri
pompously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130636">Bahâdur Shâh smiled fatuously. 'Good! Good! I
will<pb xml:id="fswater_130635" n="86 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> weave that thought with
mine into perfumed poesy.' He raised one slender hand for silence, and
with the fingers of the other continued counting feet laboriously,
until with a sigh of relief, he declaimed--
<q><l>'Bahâdur Shâh, sure all the world will know it,</l><l>Was poet more than king, yet king of poets.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_130637">Zeenut Maihl gave a cry of admiration. 'Quick! <hi rend="italic">Pir-sahib</hi>, quick!' she exclaimed. 'Such a gem must
not be lost.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130638">'But 'tis yet to be polished,' began the King complacently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130639">'That is the office of the scribe,' replied Hussan Askuri, as he
drew out his ink-horn. He was by profession an ornamental writer, and
gained great influence with the old poetaster by gathering up the
royal fragments and hiding their lameness amid magnificent curves and
flourishes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130640">'And now, <hi rend="italic">Pir-sahib</hi>,' continued the Queen,
with a look of loving anxiety at her lord, 'for this strange ailment
of which I spoke to you--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130641">The King's face lost its self importance, as if he had been
suddenly recalled to unpleasant memory. ''Tis naught of import,' he
said hastily. 'The Queen will have it I start and sweat of nights. But
this is only the timorous dread of one in her condition. I am well
enough.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130642">'My lord, <hi rend="italic">Pir-sahib</hi>, hath indeed renewed his
youth through thy pious breathing of thine own life into his mouth--as
time will show'--murmured the Queen with modest downcast look. 'But
last night he muttered in his sleep of enemies--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130643">Bahâdur Shâh gave a gasp of dismay. 'Of enemies!
Nay!--did I truly? Thou didst not tell me this.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130644">'I would not distress my lord till fear was over. Now that the
pious priest, who hath the ear of the Almighty--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130645">Hussan Askuri, who had stepped forward to gaze at the King, began
to mutter prayers. ''Tis that cooling draught of Ahsan-Oolah's stands
in the way,' he gasped, his hands and face working as if he were in
deadly conflict with an unseen foe. 'No carnal remedy--Ah! God be
praised! I see, I see! The eye of faith opens--<hi rend="italic">Hai</hi>! venomous beast, I have thee!' With the words
he rushed to the King's couch, and scattering its cushions, held up at
arm's length a lizard; held by the tail, it seemed in the
semi-darkness to writhe and wriggle.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130646" n="87 IN THE PALACE"/><p xml:id="fswater_130647">'<hi rend="italic">Ouee! Umma!</hi>' yelled the Great Moghul,
shrinking to nothing in his seat, and using after his wont the woman's
cry--sure sign of his habits.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130648">'Fear not!' cried the priest. 'The mutterings are stilled, the
sweats dried! And thus will I deal also with those who sent it.' He
flung his captive on the ground and stamped it underfoot.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130649">'Was it--was it a bis-cobra, think you?' faltered the King. He had
hold of Zeenut Maihl's hand like a frightened child.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130650">The priest shook his head. 'It was no carnal creature, he said in a
hollow chanting voice. 'It was an emissary of evil made helpless by
prayer. Give Heaven the praise'--Bahâdur Shâh began on
his creed promptly, but the priest frowned--'Through his servant,' he
went on. 'Since day and night, night and day, I pray for the King. And
I see visions, I dream dreams. Last night, while my lord muttered of
enemies, Hussan Askuri saw a flood coming from the West, and on its
topmost wave, upon a raft of faithful swords, as on a throne
sate--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130651">'With due respect,' came voices from the curtained door. 'The
disciples await initiation in the Hall of Audience.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130652">Hussan Askuri and the Queen exchanged looks. The interruption was
unwelcome, though strangely germane to the subject.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130653">'I will hear thee finish the dream afterwards,' fussed the King
rising in a bustle, for he prized his saintship next to his poetry. 'I
must not keep my pupils from grace. Hast the kerchiefs ready, Zeenut?'
There was something almost touching in the confidence of his appeal to
her. It was that of a child to its mother, certain of what it
demanded.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130654">'All things are ready,' she replied tartly, with a meaning and
vexed look at the miracle-monger; for they had meant to finish the
dream before the initiation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130655">'A goodly choice,' said the royal saint, as he looked over the tiny
silk squares, each embroidered with a text from the Koran which she
took out of a basket. 'But I need many, <hi rend="italic">Pir-sahib</hi>. Folk come fast, of late, to have the way
of virtue pointed by this poor hand. And thou hast more in the basket,
I see, Zeenut, ready against--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130657">'They are but begun,' put in the Queen, hastily covering the
basket. 'Nor will they, likely, be needed; since the leave-<pb xml:id="fswater_130656" n="88 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>season passes, and 'tis the
soldiers who come most to be disciples to the Defender of their
Faith.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130658">'I am the better pleased,' replied the King with edifying
humility. 'This summer hath too many pupils as it is. Come! <hi rend="italic">Pir-sahib</hi>, and support me through mine office with
real saintship.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130659">As the curtain fell behind them Zeenut Maihl crossed swiftly to the
crushed lizard and raised it gingerly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130660">'No carnal creature,' she repeated. It was not; only a deft piece
of patchwork. Yet it, or something else, made her shiver as she
dropped the tell-tale remains into the basket. This man Hussan Askuri
sometimes seemed to her own superstition a saint, sometimes to her
clear head, a mere sinner; she was not quite certain of anything about
him save that his delusions, his dreams, his miracles, suited her
purpose equally, whether they were false or true.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130661">So she crossed over again to a marble lattice and peered through a
convenient peephole towards the audience hall, which rose across an
intervening stretch of platform in white shadow, and whiter light. She
could not see or hear much; but enough to show her that everything was
going on the same as usual. The disciples, most of them in full
uniform, went up and down the steps calmly, and the wordy exordium on
the cardinal virtues went on and on. How different it might be, she
thought, if she had the voice. She would rouse more than those faint
'<hi rend="italic">Wâh Wâhs!</hi>' She would make the
fire come to men's eyes. In a sort of pet with her own helplessness,
she moved away and so, through another room, went to stand at another
lattice. It looked south over a strip of garden, and there was an open
square left in the tracery through which a face might peer, a hand
might pass. And as she stood she counted the remaining kerchiefs in
the basket she still held. They were all of bright green silk and bore
in the same lettering the Great Cry: '<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen!
Futteh Mahomed</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130662">As dangerous a woman this, as Hussan Askuri was a man; as
dangerous, both of them, to peaceful life, as the fabled <hi rend="italic">bis-cobra</hi>, at the idea of which the foolish old
king had cried, '<hi rend="italic">Ouee, Umma!</hi>' like any
woman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130664">And now at last that wordy exordium must be over, for, along the
garden path, came the clank of accoutrements.<pb xml:id="fswater_130663" n="89 IN THE PALACE"/> Zeenut Maihl's listless figure seemed galvanised to sudden
life, there was a flutter of green at the open square, and her voice
followed the shower of silk--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130665">'These banners from the Defender to his soldiers.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130666">But as she spoke, a stir of excitement, a subdued murmur of
expectation reached her ear from outside, and, leaning forward, she
caught a glimpse of a swinging litter coming along the path. Mahboob
returned already! Vexatious, indeed, when she had turned and planned
everything so as to be sure of having the king in her apartments when
the answer arrived. Now others would know it before she
did--unless!--the thought obliterated all others, and she flew back to
the further lattice. The king, returning from the initiation, had
paused in the middle of the platform at the sight of the approaching
litter, and his courtiers, as if by instinct, had grouped themselves
round him, leaving him the central figure. The cruel sunlight streamed
down on the tawdry court, on the worn out old man.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130667">The pause while the fat eunuch was helped from his litter seemed
interminable to the woman behind the lattice. She could have screamed
to him for the answer, could have had at his fat carcass with her
hands for its slowness. But the old king had better blood in his
veins. He stood quietly, his tawdry court around him; behind him the
marble, and gold, and mosaics of his ancestors.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130668">'What news, slave?' he asked boldly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130669">'None, Light of the Faithful,' replied the chief eunuch. None!' The
semi-circle closed in a little, every face full of disappointed
curiosity.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130670">'I have a letter for the Lord of the World with me. Its substance
is this. The <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi> will recognise no
heir. During the lifetime of our Great Master--whose life be prolonged
for ever--the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi> will make no promise of
any kind, either to His Majesty, or to any other member of the royal
family. It is to remain as if there were no succession.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130671">No succession! Above the sudden murmur of universal surprise and
dissent, a woman's cry of inarticulate rage came from behind the
lattice. The king turned towards the sound instinctively. 'I must to
the queen,' he murmured helplessly, 'I must to the queen.'</p></div><pb xml:id="fswater_130672" n="90 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><div xml:id="fswater_0202" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II<lb/>IN THE CITY</head><epigraph><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Come, beauty, rare, divine,</l><l>Thy lover like a vine</l><l>With tendril arms entwine;</l><l>Lay rose red lips to mine,</l><l>Bewildering as wine.'</l></lg></q></epigraph><p xml:id="fswater_130673">THE song came in little insistent trills and quaverings, and quaint
recurring cadences, which matched the insistency of the rhymes. The
singer was a young man of about three and twenty, and as, he sang,
seated on a Persian rug on the top of a roof, he played an elaborate
symphony of trills and cadences to match, upon a tinkling <hi rend="italic">saringi</hi>. He was small, slight, with a bright
vivacious face smooth shaven, save for a thin moustache trimmed into a
faint fine fringe. His costume marked him as a dandy of the first
water, and he smelt horribly of musk.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130674">The roof on which he sate was a secluded roof, protected from view,
even from other roofs, by high latticed walls, its only connection
with the world below it being by a dizzy brick ladder of a stair
climbing down fearlessly from one corner. Across the further end
stretched a sort of verandah, enclosed by lattice and screens. But the
middle arch being open showed a blue and white striped carpet, and a
low reed stool. Nothing more, though a sweet voice came from its
unseen corner.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130675">'Art not ashamed, Abool, to come to my discreet house among godly
folk and sing lewd songs? Will they not think the ill of me? And if
thou comest drunken horribly with wine, as thou didst last week,
claiming audience of me, thine aunt, not all that title will save me
from aspersion. And if I lose this calm retreat, whither shall poor
Newâsi go?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130676">'Nay, kind one!' cried Prince Abool-Bukr, 'that shall never be.' So
saying he cast away the tinkling <hi rend="italic">saringi</hi> and
from the litter of musical instruments around him, laid impulsive
hands on a long-necked fiddle with a 'cello tone in it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130678">'I would sing psalms to please mine aunt,' he went on in reckless
gaiety, 'but that I know none. Will pious Saadi suit your sober
neighbours, since love-lorn Hâfiz shocks them?'<pb xml:id="fswater_130677" n="91 IN THE CITY"/> But no! I can never stomach his sentimental sanctity, so
back we go to the wisest of all poets.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130679">The high thin tenor ran on without a break into a minor key, and a
stanza of the Great Tentmakers. And as it quivered and quavered over
the illusion of life, a woman's figure came to lean against the
central arch, and look down on the singer with kindly eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130681">They were the most beautiful eyes in the world. Such is the
consensus of opinion among all who ever saw them. Judged, indeed, by
this standard, the Princess Farkhoonda Zamâni, alias
Newâsi Begum, the widow of one of the king's younger sons, must
have had that mysterious charm which is beyond beauty. But she was
beautiful also, though smallpox had left its marks upon her. Chiefly,
however, by a thickening of the skin, which brought an opaque pallor
to it, giving her oval face a look of carved ivory. In truth, this
memento the past tragedy, which at the age of thirteen had brought of
her, the half-wedded bride, to death's door, and sent her
fifteen-year-old bridegroom from the festival to the grave, enhanced,
rather than detracted, from her beauty. Her lips were reddened after
the fashion of court women, her shortsighted hazel eyes, were heavily
blackened with antimony; but she wore no jewels, and her graceful
sweeping Delhi dress was of deadest, purest white, embroidered in
finest needlework round hems and seams, and relieved only by the
lighter folds of her white lace-like veil. For she had forsworn
colours when she fled from court-life and its many intrigues for an
alliance with the charming widow, and, on the plea of a call to a
religious and celibate life, had taken up her abode in the Mufti's
Alley. This was a secluded little lane off the bazaar which lies to
the south of the Jumma Mosque, where a score or two of the Mohammedan
families connected with the late chief magistrate of the city lived,
decently, respectably, respectedly. To do this, having sometimes to
close the gate at the entrance of the alley, and so shut out the
wicked world around them. That whole quarter of the city, however,
held many such learned, well-born, well-doing folk. Hussan Askari's
house lay within a stone's throw, Ahsan-Oolah's not far off, and, all
about, tall windowless buildings rose, standing sentinel blindly over
the naughtiness. But they had eyes within, and ears also; so the hands
belonging to them were held up in horror over the doings of the
Survival, and--despite<pb xml:id="fswater_130680" n="92 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> race
and religion--an inevitably reluctant, yet inevitably firm adherence
was given to Civilisation. Even the womenfolk on the high roofs knew
something of the mysterious woman across the sea, who reigned over the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> and made them pitiful to women, and
Farkhoonda Zamâni read the London news with great interest, in
the newspaper which Abool-Bukr used to bring her regularly. Hers was
the highest roof of all, save one at the back of her verandah room; so
close to it indeed that the same <hi rend="italic">neem</hi>-tree
touched both.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130682">It was not a quarter, therefore, in which the leader of the fastest
set in the palace might have been expected to be a constant
visitor. But he was; and the decorous alley put up with his songs
patiently. Partly, no doubt, for his aunt's sake; more for his own
charm of manner, which always gained him a consideration better men
might have lacked. Being the late heir-apparent's eldest son, he was
certain of succeeding to the throne if he outlived all his uncles; for
the claims of the elder generation are, by Moghul law, paramount over
those of the younger. Now, since the inevitable harking back to the
eldest branch after years of power enjoyed by the junior ones which
this plan necessitates, is responsible for half the wars and murders
which mark an Indian succession, some of these learned progressive
folk admitted tentatively that the western plan was better; and that
if Prince Abool-Bukr were only other than he was, he might as well
succeed now as later on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130683">The idea now and again roused a like ambition in the young idler,
but as a rule he was content to be the best musician in Delhi, the
boldest gambler, the fastest liver. Yet through all, he kept his hold
on one kind woman's hand; and those who knew the prince and princess,
have never a word to say against the friendship which led to that
singing of Omar Khayyâm upon the latticed roof.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130685">'Life could be better than that for thee, nephew, didst thou but
choose,' said her soft voice, interrupting the cynicism, while her
delicate fingers, touching the singer's shoulder as if in reproof,
lingered there tenderly. He bent his smooth cheek impulsively to
caress the hand so close to it, with a frank, boyish action. The next
moment, however, he had started to his feet, the minor tone changed to
a dance measure, then ended in a wild discord and a wilder laugh.<pb xml:id="fswater_130684" n="93 IN THE CITY"/> Her use of the word nephew was apt to rouse
his recklessness, for she was but a month or two older than he.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130686">'Thou canst not make me other than I was born,' he began; but she
interrupted him quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130687">'Thou wast born of good parts enough, God knows.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130688">'But my father deemed me fool, therefore I was brought up in a
stable, mine aunt; and sang in brothels ere I knew what the word
meant. So 'tis sheer waste time to interview my scandalised relations
as thou dost, and beg them to take me serious. By all the courtezans
in the Thunbi bazaar, Newâsi, I take not myself so. Nor am I
worse than the holy, pious aunt: I take paradise now, and leave hell
to the last. They choose the other way; and make a better bargain for
pleasure than I, seeing that the astrologers give me a short life, a
bloody death.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130689">Newâsi caught her hand back to another resting place above
her heart. 'A--a bloody death,' she echoed, 'who--who told the lie?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130690">Prince Abool-Bukr shook his head with a kindly smile. 'Oh! heed it
not, kind lady. Such is the fashion with soothsayers nowadays. The
heavens are black with portents. Some one's cow hath three calves,
some one's child hath ten noses and a tail. Fire hath come from
heaven--thou thyself didst tell me some such wind-sucker's tale--or
from hell more likely--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130691">'Nay! but it is true,' she interrupted eagerly; 'I had it from the
milkwoman, who comes from the village, where the <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130692">'The mouse began to gnaw the rope. The rope began to bind the
ox. The ox began--' hummed the prince irreverently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130693">Newâsi stamped her foot. 'But it is true, scoffer! There is
a festival of it to-day in some idol temple--may it be defiled! The
widow would have burnt, after sinful custom, but was prevented by the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi>. And rightly. Yet, God knows--seeing
the poor soul had to burn sometime through being an idolater--they
might have let her burn with her love--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130694">Abool laughed softly. 'And yet thou wilt have naught of
Hâfiz--Hâfiz the love-lorn! Verily, Newâsi, thou
art true woman!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130696">She ignored the interruption.--'So, being hindered, she<pb xml:id="fswater_130695" n="94 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> went to Benares, and there this
fire fell on her through prayer, and burnt hands and feet--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130697">'But not her face,' cried Prince Abool, thrumming the muted strings
and making them sound like a tom-tom. 'I'll wager my best pigeon, not
her face, if she be a good-looking wench! And since fire follows on
other things beside prayer, she was a fool not to get it, like me,
through pleasure instead. To burn a virgin! What a dreary tale! Look
not so shocked, Newâsi! a man must enjoy these presents, when
folk around him waste half the time in dreaming of a future--of
something better to come-as thou dost....' He paused, and a soft eager
ring came to his voice. 'If thou couldst only forget all that--forget
who I might be in the years to come--forget what thou wouldst have
been had my respected uncle not preferred peace to pleasure--for it
never came to pass, remember, it never came to pass--then we two, you
and I,'--he paused again, perhaps at the sudden shrinking in her eyes,
and gave a restless laugh. 'As 'tis, the present must suffice,' he
added lightly, 'and even so thou dost mourn for what I might be if the
grace of God took me unawares. Thou hast caught the dreaming trick,
mayhap, from the Prince of Dreamers yonder.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130698">He moved over to the outer parapet and waved his hand towards
Hussan Askuri's house. Then his vagrant attention turned swiftly to
something which he could see in a peep of bazaar visible from this new
point of view.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130699">'Three, four, five trays of sweetstuffs! and one of milk and
butter,' he cried eagerly, 'and by my corn-merchant's bill--which I
must pay soon or starve--the carriers are palace folk! Is there, by
chance, a marriage in the clan? Why didst not tell me before,
Newâsi? then I could have gone as musician and earned a few
rupees.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130700">He gave a flourish of his bow, so drawing forth a lugubrious wail
from the long-necked fiddle.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130701">'No marriage that I wot of,' she replied, smiling fondly over his
heedless gaiety. 'The trays will be going to the <hi rend="italic">Pirsahib's</hi> house. They have gone every Thursday
these few weeks past, ever since the queen took ill on hearing the
answer about the heirship. She vowed it then every week, so that the
holy man's prayer might bring success to our cousin of Persia in this
war--God save the very dust of it from the winds of misfortune so long
as dust and wind exist!'--she added piously.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130702" n="95 IN THE CITY"/><p xml:id="fswater_130703">Prince Abool-Bukr turned round on her sharply with anxiety in his
face. 'So! Thou too canst quote the proclamation like other fools--a
fool's message to other fools. Where didst thou see it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130704">Newâsi looked at him disdainfully. 'Can I not read, nephew,
and are there many in Delhi as heedless as thou? Why, even the Mufti's
people discuss such things.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130705">He shrugged his shoulders. 'Ay! they will talk. Gossip hath a
double tongue and wings too, nowadays. In old time the first tellers
of a tale had forgot it ere the last hearer heard it; now the whole
world is agog in half-an-hour. But it means naught--even this
heirship. Who cares in Delhi? None!--out of the palace, none! Not even
I. Yet mischief may come of it; so have naught to do with dreamings,
Newâsi, if only for my sake. Remember the old saw, "Weevils are
ground with the corn."'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130706">'Thou canst scarce call thyself that, Abool, and thou so near the
throne,' she said, still more coldly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130707">'Have me what pleaseth thee, kind one,' he replied, a trifle
impatiently; 'but remember also that "the body is slapped in the
killing of mosquitoes."' Then suddenly, an odd change came to his
mobile face. It grew strained, haggard, his voice had a growing tremor
in it. 'Lo! I tell thee, Newâsi, that Sheeah woman Zeenut Maihl
in her plots for that young fool her son will hang the lot of us. I
swear I feel a rope round my neck each time I think of her. I who only
want to be let live as I like--not to die before my time--die and lose
all the love and the laughter--die mayhap in the sunlight--die when
there is no need; I seem to see it--the sunlight--and I
helpless--helpless!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130708">He hid his face in his shuddering hands as if to shut out some
sight before his very eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130709">'Abool! Abool! What is't, dear? Look not so strange,' she cried,
stretching out her hand towards him, yet standing aloof as if in vague
alarm. Her voice seemed to bring him back to realities; he looked up
with a reckless laugh.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130710">''Tis the wine does it,' he said. 'If I lived sober--with thee,
mine aunt--these terrors would not come. Nay! be not
frightened. Hanging is a bloodless death, and that would confound the
soothsayer; so it cuts both ways. And now, since I must have more
wine, or weep, I will leave thee, Newâsi.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130711" n="96 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130712">'For the bazaar?' she asked reproachfully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130713">'For life and laughter. Lo! Newasi, thou thyself wouldst laugh at
those new-come Bunjâra folk I told thee of, who imitate the <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> so well. But for their eyes'--here he nodded
gaily to some one below--'They should get one of the Mufti's folk to
play,' he added, his attention as usual following the first lead. 'Saw
you ever such blue ones as the boy has yonder?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130714">Newâsi, drawing her veil tighter, stepped close to his side
and peered gingerly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130715">'His sister's are as blue, his cousin's also. It runs in the blood,
they say. I cannot like them. Dost thou not prefer the dark also?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130716">She raised hers to his innocently enough, then shrank back from the
sudden passion of admiration she saw blazing in them. Shrank so that
her arm touched his no longer. The action checked him, made him
savage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130717">'I like black ones best,' he said insolently, 'big black staring
eyes such as my mother swears my betrothed has to perfection. Thou
hast not seen her yet, Newâsi; so thou canst keep me company in
imagining them languishing with love. They will not have to languish
long for--hast thou heard it?--the King bath fixed the wedding.' He
paused, then added in a low, cruel voice, 'Art glad,
Newâsi?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130718">But her temper could be roused too, and her heart had beat in
answer to his look, in a way which ended calm. 'Ay!' she said, 'it
will stop this farce of coming thither for study and learning--as
to-day--without a line scanned.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130719">'Thou dost study enough for both, as thou art virtuous enough for
both,' he retorted. 'I am but flesh and blood, and my small brain will
hold no more than it can gather from bazaar tongues.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130720">--'Of lies, doubtless--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130721">'Lies if thou wilt. But they fill the mind as easily as truth, and
fit facts better. As the lie the courtesans tell of my coming hither
fits fact better than thy reason. Dost know it? Shall I tell it
thee?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130723">'Yea! tell it me,' she answered swiftly, her whole face ablaze with
anger, pride, resentment. His matched it, but with a vast affection
and admiration added which increased his excitement. 'The lie, did I
say?' he echoed, 'nay! the truth. For why do I come? Why dost let me
come?<pb xml:id="fswater_130722" n="97 IN THE CITY"/> Answer me in truth?' There was an
instant's silence, then he went on recklessly: 'What need to ask? We
both know. And why, in God's name, having come--come to see thy soft
eyes, here thy soft voice, know thy soft heart, do I go away again
like a fool?--I who take pleasure elsewhere as I choose. I will be a
fool no longer. Nay! do not struggle. I will but force thee to the
truth. I will not even kiss thee--God knows there are women and to
spare for that--there is but one woman whom Abool-Bukr cares--' he
broke off, flung the hands he had seized away from him with a muttered
curse, and stepped back from her, calming himself with an
effort. 'That comes of making me in earnest for once. Did I not warn
thee it was not wise?' he said looking at her almost reproachfully, as
she stood trying to be calm also, trying to hide the beating of her
heart.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130724">''Tis not wise, for sure, to speak foolishness,' she murmured,
attempting unconsciousness. 'Yet do I not understand--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130725">He shook his delicate hand in derisive denial. 'Why the Princess
Farkhoonda refuses to marry? Nay! Newâsi, we are two fools for
our pains. That is God's truth between us. So now for lies in the
bazaar.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130726">'Peace go with thee.' There was a sudden regret, almost a wistful
entreaty in the farewell she sent after him. There was none in his
reply, given with a backward look as his gay figure went downwards
dizzily. 'Nay! Peace stays ever with thee.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130727">It was true. Those other women of whom he had spoken gave him
kisses galore, but this one gave him more, and it was a refinement of
sensuality, in a way, to go as he had come. But Newâsi went
back to her books with a sigh, telling herself that her despondency
was due to Abool's hopeless lack of ambition. If he would only show
his natural parts, only let these new rulers see that he had the
makings of a king in him! As for the other foolishness, if the old
King would give his consent--if it were made clear that she was not
really--She pulled herself up with a start, said a prayer or two, and
went on with <hi rend="italic">The Mirror of Good Behaviour</hi>,
through which she was wading diligently. The writer of it had not been
a beautiful woman, widowed before she was a wife, but his ideals were
high.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130729">Abool-Bukr meanwhile was already in a house with a<pb xml:id="fswater_130728" n="98 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> wooden balcony. There were many such in the
Thunbi bazaar, giving it an airiness, a cleanliness, a neatness it
would otherwise have lacked. But Gul-anâri's was the biggest,
the most patronised; not only for the tired heads which looked out
unblushingly from it, but for the news and gossip always to be had
there. The lounging crowds looked up and asked for it, as they drifted
backwards and forwards aimlessly, indifferently, among the fighting
quails in their hooded cages, the dogs snarling in the filth of the
gutters, while a mingled scent of musk, and drains, and humanity
steamed through the hot sunshine. Sometimes a corpse lay in the very
roadway awaiting burial, but it provoked no more notice than a passing
remark that Nargeeza or Yasmeena had been a good one while she lasted;
for there was a hideous, horrible lack of humanity about the Thunbi
bazaar, even in the very women themselves, with their foreheads
narrowed by plastered hair to a mere wedge above a bar of continuous
eyebrow, their lips crimsoned in unnatural curves, their teeth
reddened with <hi rend="italic">pân</hi> or studded with gold
wire, their figures stiffened to artificial prominence. It was as if
humanity, tired of its own beauty, sought the lack of it as a
stimulant to jaded sensuality.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130730">'<hi rend="italic">Allâh!</hi> the old stale stories,'
yawned Gul-anâri from the broad sheet of native newspaper
whence, between the intervals of some of Prince Abool-Bukr's worst
songs, she had been reading extracts to her illiterate clients; that
being a recognised attraction in her trade. 'Persia! Persia! nothing
but Persia! Who cares for it? I dare swear none. Not even the woman
Zeenut herself, for all her pretence of sympathy with Sheeahs,
who--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130732">'Have a care, mistress!' interrupted an arrogant looking man, who
showed the peaked Afghan cap below a regimental turban. He was a
sergeant in a Pathân company of the native troops cantooned
outside Delhi on the Ridge, and had been bickering all the afternoon
with a Rajpoot of the 38th N.I., who had ousted him in his hostess's
easy affections. He was therefore in an evil temper, ready to take
offence at a word. 'I am of the north--a Sheeah myself, and care not
to hear them miscalled. And I have those who would back me,' he
continued, glaring at the Rajpoot who sate in the place of honour
beside the stout syren; 'for yonder in the corner is another
hill-tiger' He pointed to a man who had<pb xml:id="fswater_130731" n="99 IN THE CITY"/>
just thanked one of the girls in Pushtoo for a glass of sherbet she
handed him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130733">'Hill-cat rather!' giggled Gul-anâri. 'He brought me this
one, but yesterday, from a caravan new-come to the <hi rend="italic">serai</hi>--' she stroked the long fur of a Persian
kitten on her lap--'And when I asked for news could not give them. He
scarce knew enough Urdu for the settling of prices.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130734">A coarse joke from the Rajpoot, suggesting that he had found few
difficulties of that sort in the Thunbi Bazaar, made the sergeant
scowl still more and swear that he would get Mistress Gul-anâri
the news for mere love; whereat he called over, in Pushtoo, to the man
in the corner, who, however, took no notice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130735">'He is as deaf as a lizard!' giggled Gul-anâri, enjoying the
rejected one's discomfiture. 'Get my friend the corporal here to yell
at him for thee, sergeant. His voice goes further than thine!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130736">The favoured Rajpoot squeezed the fat hand nearest to him. 'Go up
and pluck him by the beard,' he suggested vaingloriously, I then we
might see a Pathân fight for once.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130737">'Thou wouldst see a fair one, which is more than thou canst among
thine own people.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130738">'Peace! Peace!' cried the courtesan, smiling to see both men look
round for a weapon. 'I'll have no bloodshed here. Keep that for the
future.' She dwelt on the last word meaningly, and it seemed to have a
soothing effect, for the sepoys contented themselves with scowls
again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130739">'The future?' echoed a grey-beard who had been drinking cinnamon
tea calmly. 'God knows there will be wars enough in it. Didst hear,
Meean-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>?--I have it on authority--that Jarn
Larnce is to give Peshawur to Dost Mahomed and take Rajpootana
instead; take it as Oude was taken, and Sambalpore, and Jhansi, and
all the others.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130740">'Even so,' assented a quiet looking man in spectacles. 'When the
last <hi rend="italic">Lât-sahib</hi> went, he got much praise
for having taken five kingdoms and given them to the Queen. The new
one was told he must give more. This begins it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130741">'Let us see what we Rajpoots say first,' cried the corporal
fiercely. ''Tis we have fought the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar's</hi>
battles, and we are not sheep to be driven against our own.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130743">Gul-anâri leered admiringly at her new lover. 'Nay! the
Rajpoots are men! and 'twas his regiment, my masters, who<pb xml:id="fswater_130742" n="100 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> refused to fight over the sea,
saying it was not in the bond. Ay! and gained their point.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130744">'That drop has gone over the sea itself,' sneered a third
soldier. 'The bond is altered now. Go we must, or be dismissed. The
Thakoor-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi> would not be so bold now, I
warrant.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130745">The Rajpoot twirled his moustache to his very eyes and cocked his
turban awry.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130746">'Ay would I! and more, if they dare touch our privilege.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130747">Gul-anâri leered again, rousing the Pathân sergeant
to mutter curses, and--as if to change the subject--cross over to the
man in the corner, lay insolent hands on his shoulder, and shout a
question in his ear. The man turned, met the arrogant eyes bent on him
calmly, and with both hands salaamed profusely but slowly with a sort
of measured rhythm. Apparently he had not caught the words and was
deprecating impatience. His hands were fine hands, slender,
well-shaped, and he wore a metal ring on the seal-finger. It caught
the light as he salaamed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130748">'Louder, man, louder!' gibed the corporal. But the sergeant did not
repeat the question; he stood looking at the upturned face awaiting an
answer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130749">'Maybe he is Belooch, his speech not mine,' he said suddenly, yet
with a strange lack of curiosity in his tone. There was a faint
quiver, as if some strain were over in the face below, and the silence
was broken by a rapid sentence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130750">'Yea! Belooch!' he went on in a still more satisfied tone, 'I know
it by the twang. So there is small use in bursting my lungs.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130752">Here Prince Abool-Bukr, who had been dozing tipsily, his head
against his fiddle, woke, and caught the last words. 'Ay, burst! burst
like the royal kettle-drums of mine ancestors. Yet will I do my poor
best to amuse the company and--and instruct them in virtue.'
Whereupon, with much maudlin emotion, he thrummed and thrilled through
a lament on the fallen fortunes of the Moghuls written by that King of
Poets his Grandpapa. Being diffuse and didactic, it was met with
acclamations, and Abool, being beyond the stage of discrimination, was
going on to give an <hi rend="italic">encore</hi> of a very different
nature, when a wild clashing of cymbals and hooting of conches in the
bazaar below sent every one to the balcony. Every one save Abool--who,
deprived of his audience,<pb xml:id="fswater_130751" n="101 IN THE CITY"/> dozed off
against his fiddle again--and the man from the corner who looked down
at the handsome drunken face as he passed it and muttered in English
'Poor devil! He rode honest enough always--but--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130753">''Tis the holy Hindu widow to whom God sent fire on her way to the
festival,' came the Rajpoot's arrogant voice from the balcony. 'A
saint indeed! I know her brother, one Soma, a Yadubânsi Rajpoot
in the 11th, new-come to Meerut.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130755">The clashings and brayings were luckily loud enough to hide an
irrepressible exclamation. The next instant the man from the corner
was half-way down the dark stairs, tearing off cap, turban, beard, and
pausing at the darkest corner to roll his baggy northern drawers out
of sight, and turn his woollen green shawl inside out, thus disclosing
a cotton lining of ascetic ochre tint. It was the work of a second,
for Jim Douglas had been an apt pupil. So, with a smear of ashes from
one pocket, a dab of turmeric and vermilion from another--put on as he
finished the stairs--he emerged into the street disguised as a
mendicant--the refuge of fools, as Tiddu had called it. The easiest
dress, however, to assume at an instant's notice, and in this case the
best for the procession which Jim Douglas meant to join. So--careless
and hurried though his get-up was--he set the very thought of
detection from him as he edged his way among the streaming crowd; for
in that, so he told himself, lay the Mysterious Gift. To
be--briefly--even in your inmost thoughts, the personality you
assumed--that was the secret. Somehow or another it impressed those
around you, and even if a challenge came there was no danger if the
challenger could be isolated--brought close, as it were, to your own
certainty. To this, so it seemed to him--the Many-faced one vehemently
protesting--came all Tiddu's mysterious instructions, which
nevertheless he followed religiously. For, be they what they might,
they had never failed him during those six months; save once, when,
watching a horse-race, he had lost--or rather recovered himself--in
the keen interest it awakened. Then his neighbours had edged from him
and stared, and he had been forced into slipping away and changing his
personality; for it was one of Tiddu's maxims that you should always
carry that with you which made such change possible. To be many-faced,
he said, made<pb xml:id="fswater_130754" n="102 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> all faces
more secure by taking from any the right of permanence. Jim Douglas
therefore joined the procession boldly, and forced his way to the very
front of it where the red-splashed figure of Durga Devi was being
carried shoulders high. It was garlanded with flowers and tensed by
swinging censers, and behind it, with wide-spread arms to show her
sacred scars, walked Tara. She was naked to the waist, and the scanty
ochre-tinted cloth folded about her middle was raised so as to show
the burns upon her lower limbs. The sunlight gleaming on its
magnificent bronze curves showed a seam or two upon her breast
also. No more. As Abool-Bukr had prophesied, her face, full of wild
spiritual exaltation, was unmarred and, with the shaven head, stood
out bold and clear as a cameo.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130756">'<hi rend="italic">Jai! Jai! Durga mai ke jai</hi>' (victory to Mother
Durga).</p><p xml:id="fswater_130757">The cry came incessantly from her lips, and was echoed not only by
the procession, but by the spectators. So from many a fierce throat
beside the corporal's--who from Gulanâri's balcony shouted it
frantically--that appeal to the Great Death Mother, implacable,
athirst for blood, came to light the sordid life of the bazaar with a
savage fire for something unknown--horribly unknown--that lay beyond
that life. Even the Mahomedans, though they spat in the gutter at the
idol, felt their hearts stir; felt that if miracles were indeed
abroad, their God--the only true One--would not shorten His Hand
either.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130758">'<hi rend="italic">Jai! Jai! Durga mai ke jai.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130759">The cry met with a sudden increase of volume as--the procession
passing into the wider space before the big mosque--it was joined by a
band of widows, who in rapturous adoration flung themselves before
Tara's feet so that she might walk over them if need be, yet somehow
touch them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130760">'Pigs of idolaters!' muttered one of a group standing on the mosque
steps; a group of men unmistakable in their flowing robes and
beards.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130761">'Peace, <hi rend="italic">Kazi-sahib</hi>!' came a mellow
voice. 'Let God judge when the work is done. "The clay is base, and
the potter mean, yet the pot helps man to wash and be clean."'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130763">The speaker, a tall, gaunt man, rose a full head above the others,
and Jim Douglas's keen eyes, taking in everything as they passed,
recognised him instantly. It was the Moulvie of Fyzabad; but as it was
partly to hear what he had to say<pb xml:id="fswater_130762" n="103 ON THE RIDGE"/> when
he was preaching, partly to find out how the people viewed the
question of the heirship which had brought Jim Douglas to Delhi, he
was not surprised at the sight.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130764">And now the procession reaching the Dareeba--that narrowest of
lanes hedged by high houses--received a momentary check. For down it,
preceded by grooms with waving yak tails, came the Resident's
buggy. He was taking a lady to see the picturesque sights of the
city. This was one, with a vengeance, as the red-splashed figure of
the Death-Goddess jammed itself in the gutter to let the aliens pass;
so getting mixed up with a Mohammedan sign-board. And the crowd
following it--an ignorant crowd agape for wonders,--stood for a
minute, hemmed in, as it were, between the buggy in front and the
mosque behind, with that group of Moulvies on its steps.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130765"><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Fire worship for a hundred years,</l><l>A century of Christ and tears,</l><l>Then the True God shall come again</l><l>And every infidel be slain,'</l></lg></q>
quoted he of Fyzabad under his breath, and the others nodded. They
knew the prophecy of Shah N'amut-oolah well. It was being bandied from
mouth to mouth in those days; for the Mohammedan crowd was also agape
for wonders.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0203" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III<lb/>ON THE RIDGE</head><p xml:id="fswater_130766">'A MELLY Klistmus to zoo, Miffis Erlton! An' oh! they's suts a lot
of boo'ful boo'ful sings in a velandah.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130768">Sonny's liquid lisp said true. On this Christmas morning the
verandah of Major Erlton's house on the Ridge of Delhi was full of
beauties to childish eyes. For he, being on special duty regarding a
scheme for cavalry remounts and having Delhi for his winter
headquarters, found plenty of contractors, agents, troopers, and
dealers, eager to be remembered by one who might probably have a voice
in much future patronage. So there were trays on trays of oranges and
apples, pistachios, almonds, raisins, round boxes<pb xml:id="fswater_130767" n="104 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> of Cabul grapes, all decked with flowers. And on
most of them, as the surest bid for recognition, lay a trumpery toy of
sorts for the Major <hi rend="italic">Sahib's</hi> little unknown son,
whose existence could, nevertheless, not be ignored by these
giftbringers, to whom children are the greatest gift of all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130769">And so, as they waited with a certain child-like complacency in
their own offerings for the recipients' tardy appearance, they had
smiled on little Sonny Seymour as he passed them on his way to give
greeting to his dearest Mrs. Erlton. For the Seymours had had the
expected change to Delhi, and Sonny's mother was now complaining of
the climate, and the servants, and the babies, in one of the houses
within the Kashmir Gate of the city; a fact which took from her the
grievance regarding dog-carts, since it lay within a walk of her
husband's office. Thus some of the smiles had not simply been given to
a child, but to a child whose father was a <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> known to the smiler; and one broad grin had
come because Sonny had paused to say, with the quaint precision with
which all English children speak Hindustani--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130770">'<hi rend="italic">Ai! Bij Rao! tu kyon aie?</hi>' (Oh, Bij Rao,
why are you here ?)</p><p xml:id="fswater_130772">The orderly's face, which Mrs. Seymour had said gave her the
shivers, had beamed over the recognition; he had risen and saluted,
explaining gravely to the <hi rend="italic">chota sahib</hi> that he
came from Meerut, because the Major-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> was
now his <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> for the time. Sonny had nodded
gravely as if he understood the position perfectly, and passed on to
the drawing-room, where Kate Erlton was sticking a few sprigs of holly
and mistletoe round the portrait of another fair-haired boy; these
same sprigs being themselves a Christmas offering from the Parsee
merchant, who had a branch establishment at a hill station. He sent
for them from the snows every year as a delicate attention to his
customers. But this year something still more reminiscent of home had
come with them--a real spruce fir for the Christmas Tree which Kate
Erlton was organising for the schoolchildren. The Tree in itself was
new to India in those days, and she had suggested a still greater
innovation; namely, that all children of parents employed in
Government offices or workshops should be invited, not only those with
pretensions to white faces. For Kate, being herself far happier and
more contented than she<pb xml:id="fswater_130771" n="105 ON THE RIDGE"/> had been nine
months before when she begged that last chance from Jim Douglas, had
begun to look out from her own life into the world around her with
greater interest. In a way, it seemed to her that the chance had
come. Not tragically, as Jim Douglas had hinted, but easily,
naturally, in this special duty, which had removed her husband both
from Alice Gissing, and his own past reputation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130773">It had sent him to Simla, where people are accepted for what they
are; and here his good looks, his good-natured, devil-may-care desire
for amusement, had made him a favourite in society, and his undoubted
knowledge of cavalry requirements stood him in good stead with the
authorities. So he had come down for the winter to Delhi on a new
track altogether. To begin with, his work interested him and made him
lead a more wholesome life. It took him away from home pretty often,
so lessening friction; for it was pleasant to return to a well-ordered
house after roughing it in out-stations. Then it took him into the
wilds where there was no betting or card-playing. He shot deer and
duck instead, and talked of caps and charges, instead of colours and
tricks. To his vast improvement; for though the slaying instinct may
not be admirable in itself, and though the hunter may rightly have
been branded from the beginning with the mark of Cain, still the
shooter or fisher generally lives straighter than his fellows. For
murder is not the most heinous of crimes; not even in regard to the
safety and welfare of the community.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130774">So Kate had begun to have those pangs of remorse which come to
women of her sort at the first symptom of regeneration in a sinner;
pangs of pitiful consideration for the big, handsome fellow who could
behave so nicely when he chose; vague questionings as to whether the
past had not been partly her fault; whether if this were the chance
she ought not to forget and forgive--many things?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130775">He looked very handsome as he lounged in, dressed spick and span in
full uniform for church parade. And she, poised on a chair, her dainty
ankles showing, looked spick and span also in a pretty new dress. He
noticed the fact instantly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130776">'A merry Christmas, Kate! Here! give me your hand and I'll help you
down.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130778">How many years was it since he had spoken like that, with a glint
in his eyes, and she had had that faint flush in<pb xml:id="fswater_130777" n="106 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> her cheek at his touch? The consciousness of
this stirring among the dry bones of something they had both deemed
dead, made her set to shaking some leaves from her dress, while he,
with an irrelevantly boisterous laugh, stooped to swing Sonny to his
shoulder. 'You here, jackanapes!' he cried. 'A merry Christmas. Come
and get a sweetie--you come too, Kate, the beggars will like to see
the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>. By Jove! what a jolly morning.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130779">A foretaste of the winter rains had fallen during the night,
leaving a crisp new-washed feeling in the air, a heavy rime-like dew
on the earth, and the sky--of a pale blue, yet colourful--vaulted the
wide expanse cloudlessly. And from the verandah of the Erlton's house
the expanse was wide, indeed, for it stood on the summit of the Ridge
at its extreme northern end. The end, therefore, furthest from the
city, which, nearly three miles away, blocked the widening wedge of
densely wooded lowland lying between the rocky range and the
river. The Ridge itself was not unlike some huge spiny saurian,
basking in the sunlight; its tail in the river, its wider, flatter
head, crowned by Hindoo Rao's house, resting on the groves and gardens
of the Subz-mundi or Green Market, a suburb to the west of the
town. It is a quaint fanciful spot this Delhi Ridge even without the
history of heroism crystallised into its very dust--a red dust which
might almost have been stained by blood--a dust which matches that
history, since it is formed of isolated atoms of rock, glittering,
perfect in themselves, like the isolated deeds which went to make up
the finest record of pluck and perseverance the world is ever likely
to see. Perseverance and pluck which sent more Englishmen to die
cheerfully in that red dust than in the defences and reliefs of
Lucknow, Cawnpore, and the subsequent campaigns all combined. Let the
verdict on the wisdom of those months of stolid endurance be what it
may, that fact remains.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130780">This quaintness of the Ridge lies in its individuality. Not eighty
feet above the river, its gradients so slight that a driver scarce
slackens speed at its steepest, there is never a mistake possible as
to where it begins or ends. Here is the river bed founded on sand;
there, cleaving the green with rough red shoulder, is the rock.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130782">From the verandah, then, its stony spine split by a road like a
parting, it trended south-west, so giving room between<pb xml:id="fswater_130781" n="107 ON THE RIDGE"/> it and the river for the rose-lit, lilac-shaded mass
of the town, with the big white bubble of the Jumma mosque in its
midst and the delicate domes fringing the palace gateways showing like
strings of pearls on the blue sky. Beyond them a bright dazzle of gold
among the green of the Garden-of-Grapes marked that last sanctuary of
a dying dynasty upon the city's eastern wall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130783">The cantonments lay to the back of the house on the western slope
of the Ridge, and on the plain beyond. This also was a widening wedge
of green wooded land cut off from the rest of the plain by a tree-set
overflow canal. The Ridge, therefore, formed the backbone of a
triangle protected by water on two sides; while on the third lay the
city and its suburbs. But--to carry out the image of the lizard--a
natural outwork lay like a huge paw on either side of the head--on the
river side the spur of Ludlow Castle, on the canal side the General's
mound.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130784">A brisk breeze was fluttering the flag on the tower cresting the
Ridge a few hundred yards from the house, and as Major Erlton stepped
into the verandah, a puff of white smoke curled citywards, and the
roll of the time-gun reveberated among the rocks.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130785">'By jingo! I must hurry up if I'm to have breakfast before church,'
he exclaimed, as the circle of gift-bringers, who had been waiting
nearly half-an-hour, rose simultaneously with salaams and good
wishes. The sudden action made a white cockatoo perched in the corner
raise its flame-coloured crest and begin to prance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130786">'Naughty Poll! Bad Poll!' came Sonny's mellifluous lisp from the
Major's shoulder. 'Zoo mufn't make a noise and innerupt.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130787">The admonition made the bird smooth its ruffled temper and
feathers. Not that there was much to interrupt, the Major's halting
acknowledgments being of the briefest; partly because of breakfast,
partly from lack of Hindustani, mostly from the inherent insular
horror of a function.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130788">'Thank God! that's over,' he said piously, when the last tray had
been emptied on the miscellaneous pile round which the servants were
already hovering expectantly, and the last well-wisher had
disappeared. 'Still it was nice of them to remember Freddy,' he added,
looking at the toys--'Wasn't it, wife? '</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130789" n="108 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130790">She looked up almost scared at the title. 'Very,' she replied, with
a faint quiver in her voice. 'We must send some home to him, mustn't
we?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130791">The pronoun of union made the Major, in his turn feel
embarrassed. He sought refuge once more in Sonny.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130792">'You must have your choice first, jackanapes!' he said, swinging
the child to the ground again. 'Which is it to be? A box of soldiers
or a monkey on a stick?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130793">'Fanks!' replied Sonny with honest dignity, 'but I'se gotted my
plesy already. She's give-ded me the polly--be-tos it 'oves me
dearly.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130794">Kate answered her husband's puzzled look with a half-apology. 'He
means the cockatoo. I thought you wouldn't mind, because it was so
dreadfully noisy. And it never screams at him. Sonny! give Polly an
apple and show Major Erlton how it loves you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130795">The child, nothing loth to show off, chose one from the heap and
went over fearlessly to the vicious bird; the servants pausing to look
admiringly. The cockatoo seized it eagerly, but only as a means to
draw the little fellow's arm within reach of its clambering feet and
the next moment it was on the narrow shoulder dipping and sidling
among the golden curls.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130796">'See how it 'oves me,' cried Sonny, his face all smiles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130797">Major Erlton laughed good-temperedly at the pretty sight and went
in to breakfast.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130798">Then the dog-cart came round. It was the same one in which the
Major had been used to drive Alice Gissing. But this Christmas morning
he had forgotten the fact, as he drove Kate instead, with Sonny--who
was to be taken to church as a great treat--crushing the flounces of
her pretty dress. Yet the fresh wind blew in their faces keenly, and
the Major, pointing with his whip to the scudding squirrels said,
'Jolly little beasts, aren't they, Kate?' just as he had said it to
Alice Gissing. What is more, she replied that it was jolly altogether
with much the same enjoyment of the mere present as the other little
lady had done; for the larger part of life is normal, common to
all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130800">So they sped past the rocks and trees swiftly, down and down, till
with a rumble they were on the drawbridge, through the massive arch of
the Kashmir Gate, into the square of the main-guard. The last clang of
the church bell<pb xml:id="fswater_130799" n="109 ON THE RIDGE"/> seemed to come from the
trees overhanging it, and in the ensuing silence a sharp click of the
whip sounded like a pistol crack. The mare sped faster though the
wooden gate into the open. To the left the Court House showed among
tall trees, to the right Skinner's House. Straight ahead, down the
road to the Calcutta Gate and the boat bridge, stood the college, the
telegraph office, a dozen or so of bungalows in gardens, and the
magazine shouldering the old cemetery; quite a colony of western ways
and works within the city wall, clinging to it between the
water-bastion and the Calcutta gate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130801">Close at hand in a central plot of garden, circled by roads, was
the church, built after the design of St. Paul's; obtrusively
occidental, crowned by a very large cross.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130802">As the mare drew up among the other carriages, the first notes of
the Christmas hymn pealed out among the roses and the pointsettias,
the glare and the green. It was not a Christmas environment; but the
festival brings its own atmosphere with it to most people, and Major
Erlton, admiring his wife's rapt face, remembered his own boyhood as
he sang a rumbling Gregorian bass of two tones and a semi-tone:
<q><l>'O come, all ye faithful! Joyful and triumphant.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_130803">The words echoed confidently into the heart of the great Mohammedan
stronghold, within earshot almost of the rose-red walls of the
palace--that survival of all the vices Christianity seeks to
destroy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130804">'They have a new service to-night,' yawned the chaplain's groom to
others grouped round a common pipe, 'I, who have served <hi rend="italic">padrés</hi> all my life--the pay is bad but the
kicks less--saw never the like. 'Tis a queer tree hung with lights,
and toys to bribe the children to worship it. They wanted mine to go,
but their mother is pious and would not. She says 'tis a spell.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130805">'Doubtless!' assented a voice. 'The spell Kali's priest, who came
from Calcutta seeking aid against it, warned us of--the spell which
forces a body to being Christian against his will.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130806">A scornful cluck came from a younger, smarter man. 'Trra! a trick
that for offerings, Dittu. The priest came to me also, but I told him
my master was not that sort. He goes not to church except on the Big
Day.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130807" n="110 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130808">'But the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>?' asked a new speaker
enviously. ''Tis the <hi rend="italic">mems</hi> do the mischief to
please the <hi rend="italic">padrés</hi>; just as our women do
it to please the priests. My <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> reads prayers
to her ayah.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130809">'Paremeshwar be praised!' ejaculated the man to whom the pipe
belonged. 'My master keeps no <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>, but the
other sort. Though as for the ayah it matters not, she has no caste to
lose.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130810">There was a grunt of general assent. The remark crystallised the
whole question to unmistakable form. So long as a man could get a pull
from his neighbour's pipe and have a right to one in return, the
master might say and do what he chose. If not; then--?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130811">An evil-faced man, who still smarted from a righteous licking given
him that morning for stealing his horse's grain, put his view of what
would happen in that case plainly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130812">'<hi rend="italic">Bullah!</hi>' sneered a bearded Sikh orderly
waiting to carry his master's prayer-book. 'You Poorbeahs can talk
glibly of-change. And why not? seeing it is but a change of masters to
born slaves. Oil burns to butter! butter to oil!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130813">The evil face scowled. 'Thou wilt have to shave under thy master
anyhow, Gooroo-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>! Ay! and dock thy pigtail
too.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130814">This allusion to a late ruling against the Nazerene customs of the
newly-raised Sikh levies might have led to blows--the bearded one
being a born fighter--if, the short service coming to an end, the
masters had not trooped out, pausing to exchange Christmas greetings
ere they dispersed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130816">'Never saw Mrs. Erlton looking so pretty,' remarked Captain Seymour
to his wife, as, with the restored Sonny between them, they moved off
to their own house, which stood close by, plumb on the city wall. He
spoke in a low voice, but Major Erlton happened to be within
earshot. He turned complacently to identify the speaker, then looked
at his wife to see if the remark was true. Scarcely; at least to
Herbert Erlton's quickened recollection of the girl he had
married. Yet she looked distinctly creditable, even desirable, as she
stood, the centre of a little group of men and women eager to help her
with the Christmas tree. It struck him suddenly, not in the least
unpleasantly, that of late his wife had had no lack of aides-de-camp,
and that one, Captain Morecombe--the pick of the lot--seemed to have
little else to do; a symptom which<pb xml:id="fswater_130815" n="111 ON THE RIDGE"/> the
Major could explain from his own experience, and which made him smile;
he being of those who admire women for being admired.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130817">'I have arranged about the conjuror, Mrs. Erlton,' said Captain
Morecombe, who was, indeed, quite ready to do her behests; 'that
sweep, Prince Abool-Bukr,--who is coming, by the way, to see the
show--has promised me the best in the bazaar. And some Bunjâra
fellows who act and that sort of business.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130818">'Better find out first what they do act,' put in young Mainwaring,
who chafed under the superior knowledge which the Captain claimed as
interpreter to the Staff. 'I saw some of those brutes in Lucknow last
spring, and--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130819">'Oh! there is no fear,' retorted the other with a condescending
smile. 'The Prince is no fool, and he is responsible. It will most
likely be something extremely instructive. Now, Mrs. Erlton, I will
drive you round to the College and you can show me anything else you
want done. I can drive you home afterwards.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130820">'Don't think we need trouble you, thanks, Morecombe,' said a voice
behind. 'I'll drive my wife. I'll stay as long as you like, Kate; and
I can stick things high up you know.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130821">There was no appeal in her husband's tone, but Kate, looking up at
his great height, felt one; and with it came a fresh spasm of that
self-reproach. As she had knelt beside him in church she had been
asking herself, if she was not unforgiving; if it was not hard on him
?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130822">'That will be a great help,' she said soberly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130823">So Mrs. Seymour, coming in daintily when the hard work was over to
put a Father Christmas on the topmost shoot, wondered plaintively how
she could have managed it without Major Erlton, and threw so much soft
admiration into her pretty eyes, that he could scarcely fail to feel a
fine fellow. He was in consequence a better one for the time being; so
that he insisted on returning in the afternoon to hand the tea and
cake, when he made several black-and-tan matrons profusely apologetic
and proud at having the finest gentleman there to wait upon them. For
the Major was a very fine animal, indeed. As Alice Gissing had told
him frankly, over and over again, his looks were his strong point.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130825">The larger portion of the guests were of this black-and-tan
complexion; of varying shades, however, from the unmis<pb xml:id="fswater_130824" n="112 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>takably pure-blooded native Christian, to
the pasty-faced baby with all the yellow tones of skin due to its
pretty languid mother, emphasised by the ruddiness of the English
father who carried it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130826">They came chiefly from Duryagunj; a quarter of the city close to
the Palace, between the river and the Thunbi bazaar. It had once been
the artillery lines, and now its pleasant garden-set houses were
occupied by clerks, contractors, overseers, and such like. Then later
on, for the sports and games, came a contingent of College lads,
speaking English fluently, and younger boys clinging affrightedly to
their father's hand as he smirked and bowed to the special master for
whose favour he had perhaps braved bitter tears of opposition from the
women at home. The mission school sent orderly bands, and there was a
ruck of servants' children, who would have gone to the gates of hell
for a gift.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130827">'You will tire yourself to death, Kate,' called her husband, as,
quite in his element, he handicapped the boys for the races. He spoke
in a half-satisfied, half-dissatisfied tone, for though her success
pleased him, he fancied she looked less dainty, less attractive.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130828">'Come and see the play,' suggested Captain Morecombe, who did not
seem to notice anything amiss. 'It will be a rest, and we needn't
light up yet awhile.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130829">'I'm going wis zoo,' said Sonny confidently, escaping from his ayah
as they passed; so, with the child's hand in hers, Kate went on into
the long narrow verandah which had been enclosed by tent-walls as a
theatre. Open to the sunlight at the entrance, it was dark enough to
make a swinging lamp necessary at the further end. There was no stage,
no scenery, only a coarse cotton cloth with indistinguishable shadows
and lights on it hung over a rope at the very end. The place was
nearly empty. A few native lads squatted in front, a bench or two held
a sprinkling of half-castes, and at the entrance a group of English
ladies and gentlemen waited for the performance to begin, laughing and
talking the while.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130830">'You look quite done,' said Captain Morecombe tenderly, as Kate
sank back in the arm-chair he placed for her halfway down, where a
chink of light and air came through a slit in the canvas.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130832">'I didn't feel tired before,' she replied dreamily.' I sup<pb xml:id="fswater_130831" n="113 ON THE RIDGE"/>pose it is the quiet, and the giving
in.--Tell me about the play, please,' she went on more briskly. 'If I
don't know something of the plot before it begins, I shall not
understand.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130833">'I expect you will,' he began; but at that moment a cry for Captain
Morecombe arose, and to his infinite anger he had to go off and
interpret for the Colonel and Prince Abool-Bukr who had just
arrived. Kate, to tell truth, felt relieved. After the clamour
outside, and the constant appeals to her, the peace within was
delightful. She leant back, with Sonny in her arms, feeling so
disposed for sleep that her husband's loud voice coming through the
chink startled her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130834">'Can't possibly take that into consideration. The race must be run
on the runners' own merits only.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130835">He was only, she knew, laying down the law of handicaps to some
dissentient; but the words thrilled her. Poor Herbert! What had <hi rend="italic">his</hi> merits been? And then she wondered how long it
had been since she had thought of him thus, by his Christian name, as
it were. Would it be possible--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130836">'It's a story of Fate, really,' said one of the spectators at the
entrance, to the ladies who were with him-his voice was clearly
audible in a sudden hush which had come to the dim verandah that grew
dimmer and dimmer to the end, despite the swinging lamp--'A sort of
miracle play, called <hi rend="italic">The Lord of Life, and the Lord
of Death</hi>. Yama and Indra of course. I saw it two days ago, and
one of the actors is the best pantomimist I ever saw.-That's the man
now.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130838">Kate turned her eyes instinctively to the open space which was to
do duty as a stage. The play had begun. It must have been going on
while she was thinking, for a scene was in full swing. A scene? That
was a misnomer when there was no scenery, nothing but that strange dim
curtain with its indefinite lights and shadows. Or was there some
meaning in the dabs and splashes after all? Was that a corn merchant's
shop? Yes, there were the gleaming pots, the cavernous shadows, the
piled baskets of flour and turmeric and pulse, the odd little strings
of dried cocoanuts and pipe cups, the blocks of red rock-salt. And
that--she gave an odd little sigh of certainty--was the corn merchant
himself selling flour, with a weighted balance, to a poor
widow. What<pb xml:id="fswater_130837" n="114 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> magnificent
pantomime it was! And what a relief that it was pantomime, so leaving
her no whit behind any one in comprehension, but the equal of all the
world, as far as this story was concerned. And it was
unmistakable. She seemed to hear the chink of money, to see the
juggling with the change, the substitution of inferior flour for that
chosen, the whole give and take of cheating, till the ill-gotten gain
was clutched tight, and the robbed woman turned away patiently,
unconsciously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130839">An odd doubtful murmur rose among the squatting boys, checked
almost as it began; for the shadowy curtain behind wavered, seemed to
grow dimmer, to curve in cloud-like festoons, and then disclosed a
sitting figure. There was a burst of laughter from the entrance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130840">'Rum sort of God, isn't he?' came the voice again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130841">But from the front rose an uneasy whisper. 'Yama! Sri Yama himself;
look at his noose!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130842">Viewed without reference to either remark, the figure, if quaint,
almost ludicrous, did not lack dignity. There was impassiveness in the
pea-green mask below the mitre-like gilt tiara, and impressiveness in
the immovability of the pea-green hands folded on the scarlet
draperies.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130843">'He answers to Charon, you know,' went on the voice once more. 'I
suppose it means that the <hi rend="italic">buniya-jee</hi> will need
all his ill-gotten gain to pay the fare to Paradise.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130844">Did it mean that, Kate wondered, as she leant back clasping Sonny
tighter in her arms, or was it only to show that Fate lay behind the
daily life of every man? Then what a farce it was to talk of
chance. Yet she had pleaded for chance once, till she had gained
it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130845">'<hi rend="italic">Let him have his chance. Let us all have our chance. You and I into the bargain.</hi>' You and I! What made her think of that now?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130846">A snigger from the lads in front roused her to a new scene; a
serio-comic dispute, evidently, between a termagent of a mother-in-law
and a tearful daughter. Kate found herself following it closely
enough, even smiling at it, but Sonny shifted restlessly on her
knee. 'I 'ikes a funny man,' he said plaintively. 'Tell a funny man to
came again, Miffis Erlton.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130848">'I expect he will come soon, dear,' she replied, conscious of a
foolish awe behind her own words. But this time, as the termagent
triumphed and the dutiful daughter-in-law wept<pb xml:id="fswater_130847" n="115 ON THE RIDGE"/> over her baking, the figure that showed wore a white mask,
the rainbow-hued garments were hung with flowers, and the white hands
held a particoloured bow.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130849">The boys nodded and smiled. 'Sri Indra himself,' they said. 'Look
at his bow!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130850">'Who is Indra, Mr. Jones?' asked a feminine voice from behind.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130851">'Lord of Paradise. And that is the whole show. It goes on and
on. Some of the scenes are awfully funny, but they wouldn't act the
funniest ones here. And they all end with the green or white dummy; so
it gets a bit monotonous. Shall we go and look at the conjurors
now?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130852">The voices departed; once more to Kate's relief. She felt that the
explanation spoilt the play. And that was no dummy! She could see the
same eyes through the mask--curious, steady, indifferent eyes--the
eyes of a Fate indifferent as to what mask it wore. So the play went
on and on. Some of the Eurasians slipped away, but the boys remained
ready with awe or rejoicing, while Kate sat by the chink through which
the light came more and more dimly as the day darkened. She scarcely
noticed the actors; she waited dreamily for the Lord of Life or the
Lord of Death--for there was never any doubt as to which was coming;
but the child in her lap waited indiscriminately for the funny
man. The thought of the contrast struck her, making her smile. Yet,
after all, the difference only lay in the way you looked at
life. There was no possibility of change to it; the Great Handicap was
run on its own merits. And then, like an unseen hand brushing away the
cobwebs which of late had been obscuring the unalterable facts, like a
wave collapsing her house of sand, came the memory of words which at
the time they were spoken had made her cry out on their cruelty. 'What
possible right have you or I to suppose that anything you or I can do
now will alter the initial fact.' If he--that stranger who had stepped
in and laid rude touch on her very soul, had been the Lord of Life or
Death himself, could he have been more remorseless? And what possessed
her that she should think of him again and again? that she should
wonder what his verdict would be on those vague thoughts of
compromise--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130854">'Mrs. Erlton! Mrs. Erlton! everything is ready. Everybody is
waiting! I have been hunting for you everywhere<pb xml:id="fswater_130853" n="116 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> It never occurred to me you would be here after
all this time. Why! you are almost alone!' Captain Morecombe's
aggrieved regret was scarcely appeased by her hurried excuse that she
believed she had been half-asleep; for the Christmas tree was lit to
its topmost branch, the guests admitted, the drawings begun.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130855">Perhaps it was the sudden change from dark to light, silence to
clamour, which gave Kate Erlton the dazed look with which she came
into that circle of radiant faces where Prince Abool-Bukr was clapping
his hands like a child and thinking--as he generally did when his
pleasures could be shared by virtue--of how he would describe it all
to Newâsi Begum on her roof. He drew a spotless white lamb as
his gift; Major Erlton its fellow, and the two men compared notes in
sheer laughter, broken English, and shattered Hindustani. And through
the fun and the pulling of crackers, Kate, who recovered herself
rapidly, flitted here and there, arranging, deciding, setting the ball
a-rolling. There was a flush on her cheek, a light in her eyes which
forced other eyes to follow her, even among the packed prying faces,
peeping from every door and window at the strange sight, the strange
spell. One pair of eyes in particular belonging to a slight,
clean-shaven man standing beside two others who carried bundles in
their hands. They were the actors in the now forsaken drama of Life
and Death. One of them, however, had evidently seen a Christmas tree
before, since he suddenly called out in the purest English--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130856">'The top branch on the left has caught! Put it out some one!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130857">The sound of his own voice seemed to discomfit him utterly. He
looked round him, then realising that the crowd was too dense for the
speaker to be accurately located save by his immediate neighbours,
gave a half-apologetic sign to the older of his two companions and
slipped away. They followed obediently, but, once outside Tiddu shook
his head at his pupil.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130858">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> will never remember to
forget. He will get into trouble some day,' he said reproachfully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130860">'Not if I stick to playing Yama and Indra,' replied Jim Douglas
with a shrug of his shoulders. 'The Mask of Fate is apt to be
inscrutable.' He made the remark chiefly for<pb xml:id="fswater_130859" n="117 ON THE RIDGE 117"/> his own benefit; for he was thinking of the strange
chance of meeting those cold blue-grey eyes again in that
fashion. Beautiful eyes, brilliant eyes! Then he smiled cynically. The
chance he had given had evidently borne fruit. She seemed quite happy,
and there was no mistaking the look on her owner's heavy face; so the
heroics had meant nothing, and he had given up his chance for a vulgar
kiss-and-make-it-up-again!</p><p xml:id="fswater_130861">It was too dark to see that look on Major Erlton's face, but it was
there, as, carrying Kate off with a certain air of proprietorship from
the compliments which had grown stale, they went to find the dog-cart,
which, in deference to the mare's nerves, had been told to await them
in a quiet corner of the compound.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130862">'You did it splendidly, Kate!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130863">His voice came contentedly through the soft darkness which hid the
easy arm which slipped to her waist, the easy smiling face which bent
to kiss hers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130864">'Oh, don't! Please don't!' The cry, almost a sob, was
unmistakable. So was the start which made her stumble over an unseen
edging to the path. Even Herbert Erlton with his blunted delicacy
could not misjudge it. He stood silent for a moment, then gave a short
hard laugh.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130865">'You haven't hurt yourself, I expect,' he said drily, 'so there's
no harm done. I'll call that fellow with the lantern to give us a
light.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130866">He did, and the vague shadow preceded by a swinging star turned out
to be young Mainwaring on his pony, with the groom carrying a
lantern.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130867">'Mrs. Erlton,' cried the lad slipping to the ground, 'what luck!
The very person I wanted. I was going round by your house on the
chance of catching you, as it was useless trying to get in a quiet
word this afternoon. I want to ask if you know any houses to let! I
had a letter this morning from Mrs. Gissing asking me to look out one
for her.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130868">'For her?' The echo came in a dull voice; Kate had scarcely
recovered from her own recoil, from a vague doubt of what she had
done.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130870">'Yes! Her husband had to go home on business and won't be out till
May. So, as the new people at Lucknow seem a poor lot, and she has old
friends at Delhi--' a<pb xml:id="fswater_130869" n="118 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
remembrance that some of these old friendships must be an unwelcome
memory to his hearer made the boy pause. But the man, smarting with
resentment, had no such scruples--what was the use of them?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130871">'Coming here, is she?' he echoed. `Then we may hope to have some
fun in this deadly-lively stuck-up place. I say, Mainwaring, would you
mind driving my wife home and lending me your pony to gallop round to
the mess. I must go there, and as it is getting late there is no use
dragging Mrs. Erlton all that way. And she has a big Christmas dinner
on, haven't you, Kate?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130872">As the young fellow climbed up into the dog-cart beside her, Kate
Erlton knew that one chance had gone irretrievably, irrevocably. Would
there be another? Suddenly in the darkness she clasped her hands tight
and prayed that there might be--that it might come soon!</p><p xml:id="fswater_130873">And round them as they drove slowly to gain the city gate, the half
seen crowd which had gathered to see the strange spell, were drifting
homewards to spread the tale of it from hearth to hearth.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0204" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV<lb/>IN THE VILLAGE</head><p xml:id="fswater_130875">THE winter rains had come and gone, leaving a legacy of gold behind
them. Promise of future gold in the emerald sea of young wheat,
guerdon of present gold in the mustard blossom curving on the green,
like the crests of waves curve upon a wind-swept northern sea. Far and
near, wide as the eye could reach, there was nothing to be seen save
this--a waving sea of green wheat crested by yellow mustard. But in
the centre, whence the eye looked, stood a human ant-hill; for the
congeries of mud alleys, mud walls, mud roofs, forming the village,
looked from a little distance like nothing else. Viewed broadly, too,
it was simply Earth made plastic by the Form-bringer, Water, hardened
again by the Sun-fire; the triple elements combined into a shell for
labouring life. Like most villages in Northern India this one stood
high on its own ruins, girt round by shallow glistening tanks
which<pb xml:id="fswater_130874" n="119 IN THE VILLAGE"/> were at once its cradle and its
grave. From them the mud for the first and last house had been dug, to
them the periodical rains of August washed back the village bit by
bit.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130876">There was scarcely a sign of life in the sky-encircled
plain. Scarcely a tree, scarcely a landmark. Nothing far or near to
show that aught lay beyond the pale horizon. The crisp cold air of a
mid-January dawn held scarcely a sound, for the village was still
asleep. Here and there, maybe, some one was stirring, but with that
deliberate calm which comes to those who by virtue of early rising
have the world to themselves. Here and there, too, in the high stone
enclosures serving at once as a protection to the village and a
cattle-fold, some goat, impatient to be roaming, bleated querulously;
but these sights and sounds only seemed to increase the stillness, the
silence surrounding them. It is a scene which to most civilised eyes
is oppressive in its self-centred isolation, its air of
remoteness. The isolation of a community self-supporting,
self-sufficing, the remoteness of a place which cares not if, indeed,
there be a world beyond its boundaries. And this one, type of many
alike in most things--above all in steadfast self-absorption--shall be
left nameless. We are in the village, that is enough.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130877">Suddenly an odd clamorous wail rang from among the green corn, and
a band of grey crane which had been standing knee-deep in the wheat
rose awkwardly and headed, arrow-shaped, for the great Nujjufgurh <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi> which they wotted of below the horizon; in
this displaying a wider outlook than the villagers who toiled and
slept within sight of those fields, while the birds left them at dawn
for the sedgy stretches of another world.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130878">At the sound, a man who had been crouching half-asleep against a
mud wall, rose to his feet and peered drowsily over the
fields. Something, he knew, must have startled the grey crane; and he
was the village watchman; as his father had been before him, as his
son, please God, would be after him. He carried a short spear hung
with jingles as his badge of office, and he leant upon it lazily as he
looked out into the grey dawn. Then he wrapped his blanket closer
round him, and walked leisurely to meet a solitary figure coming
towards him, threading its way by an invisible path through the
dewhung sea of wheat.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130879" n="120 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_130880">'<hi rend="italic">Ari</hi>, brother,' he called mildly, when he
reached earshot, 'is it well?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130881">'It is well,' came the answer. So he waited, leaning on his spear
until the new comer stood beside him, his bare legs glistening and the
folds of his drooping blanket frosted with the dew. In one hand he,
also, held a watchman's spear; in the other one of those unleavened
cakes, round and flat like a pancake, which form the daily bread alike
of rich and poor. This he held out, saying briefly--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130882">'For the elders. From the South to the North. From the East to the
West.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130883">'Wherefore?' The brief reply held vague curiosity; no more. The
cake had already changed hands, unchallenged.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130884">'God knows. It came to us from Goloowallah with the message as I
gave it. Thy folk will pass it on?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130885">'Likely; when the day's work is done. How go the crops thy way?
Here, as thou seest, 'tis God's dew on God's grain.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130886">'With us also. There will be marriages galore this May.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130887">'Ay! if this bring naught.' The speaker nodded towards the cake
which now lay on the ground between them, for they had inevitably
squatted down to take alternate pulls at a pipe. 'What can it
bring?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130888">'God knows,' replied the host in his turn. So the two, with that
final reference in their minds, sat looking dully at the <hi rend="italic">chupatti</hi> as if it were some strange wild fowl. Sat
silently as men will do over a pipe, till a clinking of anklets and a
chatter of feminine voices came round the corner, and the foremost
woman of the troop on their way to the tank drew her veil close
swiftly at sight of a stranger. Yet her voice came as swiftly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130889">'What news, brother? What news?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130890">'None for thee, Mother Kirpo,' answered the resident watchman
tartly. ''Tis for the elders.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130891">The titterings and tossings of veiled heads at this snub to the
worst gossip in the village, ended in an expectant pause as a very old
woman, with a fine-cut face which had long since forsworn concealment,
stepped up to the watchmen, and squatting down beside them raised the
cake in her wrinkled hands.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130892">'From the North to the South or the South to the North. From the
East to the West or the West to the East. Which?' she asked, nodding
her old head.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_130893" n="121 IN THE VILLAGE"/><p xml:id="fswater_130894">'Sure it was so, mother,' replied the stranger surprised. 'Dost
know aught?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130895">'Know?' she echoed, 'I know 'tis an old tale--an old tale.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130896">'What is an old tale, mother?' asked the women eagerly, as,
emboldened by the presence of the village spey-wife, they crowded
round, eyeing the cake curiously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130897">She gave a scornful laugh, let the <hi rend="italic">chupatti</hi>
drop, and rising to her feet passed on to the tank. It suited her
profession to be mysterious, and she knew no more than this, that
once, or at most twice in her long life, such a token had come
peacefully into the village, and passed out of it with its message as
peacefully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130898">'Mai Dhunnoo knows something, for sure,' commented a deep-bosomed
mother of sons as the troop followed their chaperone's lead, closer
serried than before, and full of whispering surmise. 'The gods send it
mean not small-pox. I will give curds and sugar to thee,
Mâta-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>, each Friday for a year! I swear
it for safety to the boys.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130899">'He slipped in a puddle and cried "Hail to the Ganges,"' retorted
her neighbour, an ill-looking woman blind of one eye. She had been the
richest heiress in the village, and was in consequence the wife of the
handsomest young man in it; a childless wife into the bargain. 'Boys
do not fill the world, Veru--not even thine! Their welfare will not
set tokens a-going. It needs some real misfortune for that.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130900">'Then thy life is safe for sure,' began the other hotly, when a
peacemaker intervened.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130901">'Wrangle not, sisters!' All are naked when their clothes are gone;
and the warning may be for us all. Mayhap the Toorks are coming once
more--Mai Dhunnoo said 'twas an old tale--God send we be not all reft
from our husbands.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130902">'That would I never be,' protested the heiress, provoking
uproarious titterings among some girls.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130903">'No such luck for poor Ramo,' whispered one. 'And she sonless
too!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130904">'He shaved for the heat, and then the hail fell on his bald pate,'
quoted the prettiest callously. 'Serve him right, say I. He, at least,
had two eyes.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130906">The burst of laughter following this sally made the peacemaker,
who, as the wife of the head-man, had authority, turn in rebuke. 'Twas
no laughing matter to Jâtnis, as they were, who did so much of
the field work, that a token, may be of<pb xml:id="fswater_130905" n="122 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> ill, should come to the village when the harvest
promised so well. The revenue had to be paid, small-pox or no
smallpox, Toork or no Toork. And was not one of the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> in camp already giving one eye to the look
of the crops, and the other to the shooting of wild things? Could they
not hear the sound of his gun for themselves if they listened instead
of chattering? And truly enough, in the pause which came to mirth,
there echoed from the pale northern horizon, beyond which lay the big
<hi rend="italic">jheels</hi>, a shot or two, faint and far; for all
that dealing death to some of God's creatures. And these listeners
dealt death to none; their faith forbade it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130907">'Think you they will come our way and kill our deer as they did
once?' asked a slender slip of a girl anxiously. Her tame fawn had
lately taken to joining the wild ones when they came at dawn to feed
upon the wheat.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130908">'God knows,' replied one beside her. 'They will come if they like,
and kill if they like. Are they not the masters.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130909">So the final reference was in the womens' minds also, as, while the
muddy water strained slowly into their pots through a filtering corner
of their veils, they raised their eyes curiously, doubtfully, to the
horizon which held the master. It had held him always. To the north or
to the south, the east or the west. Mohammedan, Mahratta,
Christian. But always coming over the far horizon and slaying
something. In old days husbands, brothers, fathers. Nowadays the herds
of deer which the sacredness of life allowed to have their full of the
wheat unchecked, or the peacocks who spread their tails, securely
vainglorious, on the heaps of corn upon the threshing floors.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130910">So the unleavened cake stayed in the village all day long, and when
the slant shadows brought leisure, the headman's wife baked two cakes,
one for the north the other for the west, and Dittu the old watchman,
and the embryo watchman his son, set off with them to the next village
west and north, since that was the old custom. So much must be done
because their fathers had done it; for the rest who could tell?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130912">Nevertheless, as the messengers passed through the village street
where the women sat spinning, many paused to look after them, with a
vague relief that the unknown, unsought, had gone out of their
life. Then the moon rose peacefully, and one by one the sights and
sounds of that life ceased. The<pb xml:id="fswater_130911" n="123 IN THE VILLAGE"/> latest
of all was the hum of a mill in one of the poorest houses, and a
snatch of a harvest-song in murmuring accompaniment:--
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>'When the sickle meets the corn,</l><l>From their meeting joy is born;</l><l>When the sickle smites the wheat</l><l>Care is conquered, sorrow beat.'</l></lg></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_130913">'Have a care, sister, have a care!' came that rebuking voice from
the headman's house close by. 'Wouldst bring ill-luck on us all, that
grinding but millet thou singest the song of wheat?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130914">And thereinafter there was no song at all, and sleep settled on all
things peacefully. The token had come and gone, leaving the mud shell,
and the labouring life within it as it had been before. Curiously
impassive, impassively curious. There was one more portent in the sky,
one more mist on the dim horizon. That was all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130915">So through the dew-hung fields the mysterious message sped west and
south.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130916">Sent by whom? And wherefore?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130918">The question was being asked by the masters in desultory fashion as
they sat round a bonfire, which blazed in the centre the Resident's
camp, on the banks of the great <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi>. It was a
shooting camp, a standing camp, lavish in comfort. The white tents
were ranged symmetrically on three sides of a square, and, in the
moonlight, shone almost as brightly as the long levels of water
stretching away on the fourth side to the sedgy brakes and isolated
palms of the snipe marshes. Behind rose a heavy mass of burnished
foliage, and in front of the big mess-tent the English flag drooped
from its mast in the still night air. Nearer the <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi> again the bonfire flashed and crackled,
sending a column of smoke and sparks into the star-set sky. The ground
about it was spread with carpets and Persian rugs, and here, in
luxurious armchairs, the comfortably-tired sportsmen were lounging
after dinner, some of them in mess uniform, some in civilian black,
but all in decorous dress; for not only was the Brigadier present, but
also a small sprinkling of ladies wrapped in fur cloaks above their
evening fineries. Briefly, it was a company more suitable to the foyer
of a theatre than this barbaric bonfire. But the whole camp, with its
endless luxury, stood out in keen<pb xml:id="fswater_130917" n="124 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> contrast with the sordid savagery of a wretched hamlet which
lay half-hidden behind the trees.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130919">The contrast struck Jim Douglas, who for that evening only,
happened to be the Resident's guest; for having been on the <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi> in a very different sort of camp when the
Resident's had invaded his solitude, the usual invitation to dine had
followed as a matter of course; as it would have followed to any white
face with pretensions to be considered a gentleman's. He had accepted
it, because, every now and again, a desire 'to chuck' as he expressed
it, and go back to the ordinary life of his class came over him. This
mood had been on him persistently ever since the Yama and Indra
incident, so that, for the time being, he had dismissed his scoundrels
and given up spying in disgust. He had, he told himself, wasted his
time, and the military magnate was justified in politely dispensing
with his further services. There was, in truth, no need for them so
far as he could see. There was plenty of talk, plenty of discontent,
but nothing more. And what there was any one could observe and gauge,
for there was no mystery, no concealment; the whole affair was
invertebrate utterly, except every now and again when you came upon
the track of the Moulvie of Fyzabad. It was conceivable that the
aspect might change, but for the present he was sick of the whole
thing, ambition and all. Horsedealing was better. So he had
established himself in a small house in Duryagunj, started a stable,
and then taken a holiday in a shooting <hi rend="italic">pâl</hi> among the <hi rend="italic">jheels</hi>
and jungles, where in his younger days he had spent so much of his
time.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130920">Thus, after eating a first-class dinner, he was smoking a
first-class cigar, and--being a stranger to every one there--thinking
his own thoughts, when the Resident's voice came from the other side
of the fire which, with its dancing flamelight distorting every
feature in myriad variation, disguised rather than revealed the faces
seen by it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130921">'You have bagged one or two in your district, haven't you,
Ford?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130922">'What, sir? Bustard?' inquired the Collector of the next district,
who had come over his border for a day or two's shoot, and who had
been engrossed in sporting talk with his neighbour. There was a laugh
from the other side of the fire.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130924">'No! these <hi rend="italic">chupatties</hi>. The Brigadier was
asking me if<pb xml:id="fswater_130923" n="125 IN THE VILLAGE"/> they were as numerous as
they are further south, and Fraser, here, said none had come into the
Delhi district as yet.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130925">'One came to-day into the hamlet behind the tents,' said Jim
Douglas quietly. 'I met the man bringing it; a watchman from over the
border in Mr. Ford's district.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130926">Half-a-dozen faces turned to the voice which spoke so confidently,
and then asked in whispers who the man was? But there was nothing in
the whispered replies to warrant that tone of imparting information to
others, and a man in black clothes seemed to resent it, for he
appealed to the Resident rather fulsomely.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130927">'It will be in the reports to-morrow, no doubt, sir. For myself I
attach no importance to it. The custom is an old one; I remember
observing it in Muttra when small-pox was bad. But I should like to
have your opinion; you ought to know if any one does.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130928">The compliment was no idle flattery. None had a better right to it
than Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, whose illustrious name had been a power
in Delhi for two generations, and whose uncle had been one of India's
most distinguished statesmen. So there was a hush for his reply.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130929">'I can't say,' he answered deliberately. 'Personally I doubt the
dissatisfaction ever coming to a head. There is a good deal of course;
but of late, so it has seemed to me, it is quieting down. People are
getting tired of fermenting. As for the causes of the disaffection it
is patent. We can't, simply, do the work we are doing without making
enemies of those whose vested interests we have to destroy. We may
have gone ahead a little too fast; but that is another question. As
for the army, I've no right to speak of it, but it seems to me it has
been allowed to get out of hand, out of touch. It will need care to
bring it into discipline, but I don't anticipate trouble. Its mixed
character is our safeguard. It would be hard for even a good leader to
hit on a general grievance which would touch both the army and the
civil population, Hindoos and Mohammedans--and as a matter of fact
they have no leader at all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130930">'Have you ever come across the Moulvie of Fyzabad, sir?' remarked
Jim Douglas again. 'If I had the power I would shoot him like a mad
dog. But for the rest I quite agree.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130932">Here a stir behind them distracted both his attention and<pb xml:id="fswater_130931" n="126 IN THE VILLAGE"/> attention of those who were listening to
this authoritative voice with bated breath.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130933">'Is that the post? Oh! how delightful,' chorussed the ladies, and
more than one added plaintively, 'I wonder if the English mail is
in.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130934">'Let's bet on it. Sir Theophilus to hold the stakes,' cried a young
fellow who had been yawning through the discussion. But the subject
was too serious for such light handling, to judge by the eager faces
which crowded round while the red-coated <hi rend="italic">chuprassies</hi> poured the contents of the bags into a
heap on the carpet at their master's feet. There is always a suspense
about that moment of search among the bundles of official
correspondence the files the cases which fill up the camp mail, for
the thin packet of private letters which is the only tie between you
and the world; but when hopes of home news is superadded, the breath
is apt to come faster. And so a scene, trivial in itself, points an
inexorable finger to the broad fact underlying all our Indian
administration, that we are strangers and exiles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130935">'Not in!' announced the Resident, studiously cheerful. 'But there
are heaps of letters for everybody. Did the <hi rend="italic">memsahib</hi> come in the carriage, Gamoo?' he added, as
he sorted out the owners.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130936">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>!' replied the head orderly, who was
also his master's factotum, thrusting the remainder back in the
bags. 'And the Major <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> also. According to
order, refreshments are being offered.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130937">'Glad Erlton could come,' remarked a voice to its neighbour. 'We
want another good shot badly.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130938">'And Mrs. Gissing is awfully good company too,' assented the
neighbour. Jim Douglas who was sitting on the other side looked up
quickly; the juxtaposition of the names surprised him after what he
had seen, or thought he had seen, at Christmas time.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130939">'Is that Mrs. Gissing from Lucknow?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130940">'I believe so. She is a stranger here. Seems awfully jolly, but the
women don't like her. Do you know anything of her?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130942">Jim Douglas hesitated. He could have easily satisfied the ear
evidently agog for scandal; but what, after all, did he know of her?
What did he know of his own experience? It seemed to him as if she
stood there, defiantly dignified,<pb xml:id="fswater_130941" n="127 IN THE VILLAGE"/>
asking him the question, her china-blue eyes flashing, the childish
face set and stern.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130943">'Personally I know little,' he replied, 'but that little is very
much to her credit.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130944">As he relapsed into silence and smoke, he felt that she had once
more walked boldly into his consciousness and claimed recognition. She
had forced him to acknowledge something in her which corresponded with
something in him. Something unexpected. If Kate Erlton's eyes with
their cold glint in them had flashed like that, he would not have
wondered; but they had not. They had done just the reverse. They had
softened; they had only looked heroic. Underneath the glint which had
sent him on a wild-goose chase had lain that common-place indefinable
womanhood, sweet enough, but a bit sickly, which could be in any
woman's eyes if you fancied yourself in love with her. It had lain in
the eyes belonging to the golden curl, in poor little Zora's eyes,
might conceivably lie in half a dozen others.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130945">'By George!' came an eager voice from the group of men who were
reading their letters by the light of a lamp held for the purpose by a
silent bronze image of a man in uniform. 'I have some news here which
will interest you, sir. There has been a row at Dum-Dum about the new
Enfield cartridges.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130946">'Eh! what's that?' asked the Brigadier, looking up from his own
correspondence. 'Nothing serious, I hope.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130947">'Not yet, but it seems curious by the light of what we were
discussing, and what Mr.--er-Capt--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130948">'Douglas,' suggested the owner of the name, who at the first words
had sat up to listen intently. His face had a certain anticipation in
it--almost an eagerness.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130949">'Thanks. It's a letter from the musketry depôt. Shall I read
it, sir?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130950">The Brigadier nodded, one or two men looked up to listen, but most
went on with their letters or discussed the chances of slaughter for
the morrow.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130952">'There is a most unpleasant feeling abroad respecting these new
cartridges, which came to light a day or two ago in consequence of a
high-caste Sepoy refusing to let a lower caste workman drink out of
his cup. The man retorted that as the cartridges being made in the
Arsenal were smeared<pb xml:id="fswater_130951" n="128 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> with
pig's grease and cow's fat there would soon be no caste left in the
army. The Sepoy complained, and it came out that this idea is already
widely spread. Wright denied the fact flatly at first, but found out
that large quantities of beeftallow <hi rend="italic">had</hi> been
indented for by the Ordnance. And that, of course, made the men think
he had lied about it. Bontein, the chief, has wisely suggested
altering the drill, since the men say they will not bite the
cartridges. If they do, their relations won't eat with them, when they
go home on leave. You see, with this new rifle it is not really
necessary to bite the cartridge at all, so it would be a quite natural
alteration, and get us out of the difficulty without giving in. The
suggestion has been forwarded, and if it could be settled sharp would
smother the business; but what with duffers and--' the reader broke
off, and a faint smile showed even on the Brigadier's face as the
former skipped hurriedly to find something safer--'Old General
Hearsey, who knows the natives like a book, says there is trouble in
it. He declares that the Moulvie of Fyzabad--whoever that may be--'
the faces looked at Jim Douglas curiously, but he was too eager to
notice it--'Is at the bottom of the <hi rend="italic">chupatties</hi>
we hear are being sent round up-country; but that he is in league also
with the Brahmins in Calcutta--especially the priests at Kali's
shrine--over <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> and widow re-marriage and
all that. However, all I know is that both Hindoos and Mohammedans in
my classes are in a blue funk about the cartridges, and swear even
their wives won't live with them if they touch them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130953">'The common grievance,' said Jim Douglas, in the silence that
ensued. 'It alters the whole aspect of affairs.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130954">'Prepare to receive cavalry!' yawned the man who had suggested
betting on the chance of the home-mail. What was the use of a week's
leave on the best snipe <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi> about, if it was
to be spent in talking shop?</p><p xml:id="fswater_130955">'No!' cried the man in black, not unwilling to change the subject
of which he had not yet official cognisance. 'Prepare to receive
ladies. There is Mrs. Gissing, looking as fresh as paint!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130957">She looked fresh, indeed, as she came forward; her curly hair,
rough when fashionable heads were smooth, glistening in the firelight,
the fluffy swansdown on her long coat framing her childish face
softly. Behind her, heavy; handsome, came<pb xml:id="fswater_130956" n="129 IN THE VILLAGE"/> Major Erlton with the half-sheepish air men assume when
they are following a woman's lead.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130958">'Here I am at last, Sir Theophilus,' she began, in a gay artificial
voice as she passed Jim Douglas, who stood up, pushing his chair aside
to give more room. 'I'm so glad Major Erlton managed to get leave. I'm
such a coward! I should have died of fright all by myself in that
long, lonely--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130959">'Keep still!' interrupted a peremptory voice behind her, as a pair
of swift unceremonious arms seized her round the waist, and by sheer
force dragged her back a step, then held her tight-clasped to
something that beat fast despite the calm tone. 'Kill that snake, some
one! There, right at her feet! It isn't a branch. I saw it move. Don't
stir, Mrs. Gissing, it's all right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130960">It might be, but the heart she felt beat hard; and the one beneath
his hand gave a bound and then seemed to stand still, as the sticks
and staves, hastily caught up, smote furiously on her very dress, so
close did certain death lie to her. There was a faint scent of
lavender about that dress, about her curly hair, which Jim Douglas
never forgot; just as he never forgot the passionate admiration which
made his hands relax to an infinite tenderness, when she uttered no
cry, no sound when there was no need to hold her, so still did she
stand, so absolutely in unison with the defiance of Fate which kept
him steady as a rock. Surely no one in all his life, he thought, had
ever stood so close to him, yet so far off!</p><p xml:id="fswater_130961">'God bless my soul! My dear lady, what an escape!' The hurried
faltering exclamation from a bystander heralded the holding up of a
long limp rope of a thing hanging helplessly over a stick. It was the
signal for a perfect babel. Many had seen the brute, but had thought
it a branch, others had similar experiences of drowsy snakes scorched
out of winter quarters in some hollow log, and all crowded round
Mrs. Gissing loud in praise of her coolness. Only she turned quickly
to see who had held her--and found Major Erlton.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130962">'The brute hasn't touched you, has he?' he began huskily, then
broke into almost a sob of relief, 'My God! what an escape.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130964">She glanced at him with the faint distaste which any expression of
strong emotion showed towards her by a man<pb xml:id="fswater_130963" n="130 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> always provoked, and gave one of her high irrelevant
laughs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130965">'Is it? I may die a worse death. But I want <hi rend="italic">him</hi>--where is he.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130966">'Slipped away from your gratitude, I expect,' said the
Collector. 'But I'll betray him. It was the man who knew about the <hi rend="italic">chupatties</hi>, Sir Theophilus; I don't know his
name.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130967">'Douglas,' said the host. 'He is in camp a mile or two down the <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi>. I expect he has gone back. He seemed a nice
fellow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130968">Mrs. Gissing made a <hi rend="italic">moue</hi>. 'I would not have
been so grateful as all that! I would only have said "Bravo" to him.'
Her own phrase seemed to startle her, she broke off with a sudden
wistful look in her wide blue eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130969">'My dear Mrs. Gissing, have a glass of wine; you must indeed,'
fussed the Brigadier. But the little lady set the suggestion
aside.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130970">'Douglas!' she repeated. 'I wonder where he comes from? Does any
one know a Douglas?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130971">'James Sholto Douglas,' corrected the host. 'It's a good name.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130972">'And I knew a good fellow of that name once; but he went under,'
said an older man.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130973">'About what?' Alice Gissing's eyes challenged the speaker, who
stood close to her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130974">'About a woman, my dear lady.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130975">'Poor dear! Erlton, you must fetch him over to see me to-morrow
morning.' She said it with infinite verve, and her hearers
laughed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130976">'Him!' retorted some one. 'How do you know it's the same man?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130977">She nodded her head gaily. 'I've a fancy it is. And I am bound to
be nice to him anyhow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130979">She had not the chance, however. Major Erlton riding over before
breakfast to catch him, found nothing but the square-shaped furrow
surrounding a dry vacant spot which shows where a tent has been. For
Jim Douglas was already on his way back to Delhi, on his way back to
more than Delhi if he succeeded in carrying out a plan which had
suggested itself to him when he heard of General Hearsey's belief that
the priests conducting the agitation against widow remarriage and the
abolition of <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> were leagued with<pb xml:id="fswater_130978" n="131 IN THE VILLAGE"/> the Mohammedan revival. Tara, the
would-be saint, was still in Delhi. He had not sought her out before,
being in truth angry with the woman's duplicity, and not wanting to
run the risk of her chattering about him. Now, as he had said, the
whole position was changed. He had no common hold upon her, and might
through her get some useful hints as to the leading men in the
movement. She must have seen them when the miracle took place at
Benares. The thought made him smile rather savagely. Decidedly she
would not care to defy his tongue--from saint to sinner would be too
great a fall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130981">So at dusk that very evening he was back in his mendicant's
disguise, begging at a doorway in one of the oldest parts of Delhi; an
insignificant doorway in an insignificant alley. But there was a faded
wreath of yellow marigolds over the architrave, a deeper hollow in the
stone threshold--sure signs both, that something to attract
worshipping feet lay within. Yet at first sight the court into which
you entered, after a brief passage barred by blank wall, was much as
other courts. It was set round with high irregular houses, perfect
rabbit-warrens of tiny rooms, slips of roof, and stairs; all
conglomerate, yet distinct. Some reached from within, some from
without, some from neighbouring roofs, and some, heaven knows how!
possibly by wings after the fashion of the purple pigeons cooing and
sidling on the purple brick cornices. In one corner, however, stood a
huge <hi rend="italic">peepul-tree</hi>, and partly shaded by this,
partly attached to an arcaded building of two stories, was a small
squalid-looking black stone Hindoo temple. It was not more than ten
feet square, triply recessed at each corner, and with a pointed spire
continuing the recesses of the base; a sort of hollow monolith raised
on a plinth of three steps. In its dark windowless sanctuary, open to
the outside world by a single arch, stood a polished black stone,
resting on a polished black stone cup, like a large acorn ; for this
was the oldest Shivâla in Delhi, and in the rabbit-warrens
surrounding this survival of Baal worship lived and lodged <hi rend="italic">yogis</hi>, beggars, saints, half the insanity and
sacerdotalism of Delhi. It was not a place into which to venture
rashly; so Jim Douglas sat at the gate begging, while the clashings
and brayings and drummings echoed out into the alley. For the
seven-fold circling of the Lamps was going on, and if Tara did not
pass to this evening<pb xml:id="fswater_130980" n="132 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
service from outside, she most likely lived within--that she lodged
near the temple, he knew.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130982">So as he sat waiting, watching, the light faded, the faint smell of
incense grew fainter, the stream of worshippers coming to take the
holy water in which the God had been washed slackened. Then by twos
and threes the Brahmins and yogis--the Dean and Chapter, as it
were--passed out clinking half-pennies, and carrying the offertory in
kind, tied up in handkerchiefs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130983">The service was over, and Tara must therefore live in a lodging
reached from within. And now, when the coast was clearing, he might
still have opportunity of tracing her. So he rose and walked in
boldly, disappointed to find the courtyard was almost empty
already. There were only a few stragglers, mostly women, and they in
the white shroud of widows; but even in the gloom and shadow he could
see the tall figure he sought was not among them, and he was about to
slip away when, following their looks, he caught sight of another
figure crouching on the topmost step of the plinth, right in front of
the sanctuary door, so that it stood faintly-outlined against the
glimmer of the single cresset, which, raised on the heap of half-dead
flowers within showed them and nothing more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130984">He drew back hastily into the empty arcade, and waited for the
widows' lingering bare feet--scarcely heard even on those echoing
stones--to pass out and leave him and Tara alone. For it was Tara;
that he knew though her face was turned from him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130985">The feet lingered on, making him fear lest some of the mendicants
who must lodge in these arcades should return, after almsgiving time,
and find him there. And as they lingered he thought how he had best
make himself known to the devotee, the saint. It must be something
dramatic, something to tie her tongue at once, something to bring home
to her his hold upon her. The locket! He slipped it from his neck and
stood ready. Then, as the last flutter of white disappeared, he
stepped noiselessly across the court.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130987">And so, suddenly, between the rapt face and the dim light on which
its eyes were fixed, hung a dangling gold oval, and the Englishman
bending over the woman's shoulder from behind, could see the amaze
flash to her face. His other<pb xml:id="fswater_130986" n="133 IN THE RESIDENCY"/> hand
was ready with the clutch of command, his tongue with a swift threat;
but she was too quick for him; she was round at his feet in an
instant, clasping them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130988">'Master! Master!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130989">Jim Douglas recoiled from that touch once more; but with a
half-shamed surprise, regret, almost remorse. He had meant to threaten
this woman, and now--</p><p xml:id="fswater_130990">She was up again, eager excited. 'Quick! The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> is not safe here. They may return any
moment. Quick! Quick! <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, follow me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130991">And as, blindly, he obeyed, passing rapidly through a low doorway
and so up a dark staircase, he slipped the locket back to its place
with a sort of groan. Here was another woman to be reckoned with, and
though the discovery suited his purpose, and though he knew himself to
be as safe as her woman's wit could make him, he wondered irritably if
there was anything in the world into which this eternal question of
sex did not intrude. And then, suddenly, he seemed to feel Alice
Gissing's heart beat beneath his hand; there had been no womanhood in
that touch.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130992">So he passed on. And next morning he was on his way
southwards. Tara had told him what he wanted to know.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0205" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V<lb/>IN THE RESIDENCY</head><p xml:id="fswater_130993">'STRAWBERRIES! Oh! how delightful.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130994">Kate Erlton looked with real emotion at a plate of strawberries and
cream which Captain Morecombe had just handed to her. 'They are the
first I have ever seen in India,' she went on in almost pathetic
explanation of her apparent greed. 'Where could Sir Theophilus have
got them?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130995">'Meerut,' replied her cavalier with a kindly smile. 'They grow up
country. But they put one in mind of home, don't they?' He turned
away, almost embarrassed, from the look in her eyes, and added, as if
to change the subject, 'The Resident does it splendidly, does not
he?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_130997">There could be no two opinions as to that. The park-like grounds
were kept like an English garden, the house was<pb xml:id="fswater_130996" n="134 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> crammed from floor to ceiling with works of art,
the broad verandahs were full of rare plants, and really valuable
statuary. That towards the river, on the brink of which Metcalfe House
stood, gave on a balustraded terrace which was in reality the roof of
a lower storey excavated, for the sake of coolness, in the bank
itself. Here, amongst others, was the billiard room, from the balcony
of which you could see along the curved stone embankment of the river
to the Koodsia garden, which lay between Metcalfe Park and the
rose-red wall of the city. It was an old pleasure-ground of the
Moghuls, and a ruined palace, half-hidden in creepers, half-lost in
sheer luxuriance of blossom still stood in its wilderness of forest
trees and scented shrubs. It was a very different style of garden from
that over which Kate Erlton looked, as it undulated away in lawns and
drives between the Ridge aud the river.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130998">'Yes!' she said, 'it always reminds me of England but for that--'
She pointed to the dome of a Mohammedan tomb which curved boldly into
the blue sky close to the house.</p><p xml:id="fswater_130999">'Yet that is the original owner,' replied her companion. 'There is
rather an odd story about that tomb, Mrs. Erlton. It is the burial
place of the great Akhbar's foster-brother. Most likely he was a
cowherd by caste, for their women often go out as nurses, and the land
about here all belonged to these Goojers as they are called. But when
we occupied Delhi, a civilian--one Blake--fancied the tomb as a house,
added to it, and removed the good gentleman's grave-stone to make room
for his dining-table-a hospitable man, no doubt, as the Resident is
now. But the Goojers objected, appealed to the Government agent. In
vain. Curiously enough both those men were, shortly afterwards,
assassinated.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301000">'You don't mean to connect--' began Kate in a tone of
remonstrance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301001">Captain Morecombe laughed. 'In India, Mrs. Erlton, it is foolish to
try and settle which comes first the owl or the egg. You can't
differentiate cause and effect when both are incomprehensible. But if
I were Resident I should insure myself and my house against the act of
God and the Queen's enemies.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301002">'But this house--' she protested.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301004">'Is built on the site of a Goojer village, and they were<pb xml:id="fswater_1301003" n="135 IN THE RESIDENCY"/> most unwilling to sell. One could
hardly believe it now, could one? Come and see the river terrace. It
is the prettiest place in Delhi at this time of the year.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301006">He was right; for the last days of March, the first ones of April
are the crown and glory of a Northern Indian garden. Perhaps because
there is already that faint hint of decay which makes beauty more
precious. Another short week and the flower-lover going the evening
round will find many a sun-weary head in the garden. But on this
glorious afternoon, when the Resident was entertaining Delhi in right
residential fashion, there was not a leaf out of place, a blade of
grass untrimmed. Long lines of English annuals in pots bordered the
broad walks evenly, the scentless gardenia festooned the rows of
cypress in disciplined freedom, the roses had not a fallen petal,
though the palms swept their long fringes above them boldly, and
strange perfumed creepers leapt to the branches of the forest
trees. In one glade, beside an artificial lake, some ladies in gay
dresses were competing for an archery prize. On a brick dais close to
the house the band of a native regiment was playing national airs, and
beside it stood a gorgeous marquee of Kashmir shawls with silver poles
and Persian carpets; the whole--stock and block--having belonged to
some potentate or another, dead, banished, or annexed. Here those who
wished for it found rest in English chairs or oriental divans; and
here, contrasting with their host and his friends, harmonising with
the Kashmir shawl marquee, stood a group of guests from the palace. A
perfect bevy of princes, suave, watchful, ready at the slightest
encouragement to crowd round the Resident, or the Commissioner, or the
Brigadier, with noiseless white-stockinged feet. Equally ready to
relapse into stolid indifference when unnoticed. Here was Mirza Moghul
the king's eldest son and his two supporters, all with lynx eyes for a
sign, a hint, of favour or disfavour. And here--a sulky sickly looking
lad of eighteen was Jewan Bukt, Zeenut Maihl's darling, dressed
gorgeously and blazing with jewels which left no doubt as to who would
be the heir-apparent if she had her way. Prince Abool-Bukr however,
scented, effeminate, watched the proceedings with bright eyes; giving
the ladies unabashed admiration and after a time actually strolling
away to listen to the music. Finally, however, drifting to the stables
to gamble with the grooms over a<pb xml:id="fswater_1301005" n="136 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> quail fight. Then there were lesser lights. Ahsan-Oolah the
physician, his lean plausible face and thin white beard suiting his
black gown and skull-cap, discussed the system of Greek medicine with
the Scotch surgeon, whose fluent, trenchant Hindustani had an
Aberdonian twang. Then there was Elahi Buksh, whose daughter was widow
of the late heir-apparent; a wily man, dogging the Resident's steps
with persistent adulation, and watched uneasily by all the other
factions. A few rich bankers curiously obsequious to the youngest
ensign, and one or two pensioners owing their invitations to loyal
service made up the company, which kept to the Persian carpets so as
to avoid the necessity for slipping on and off the shoes which lay in
rows under Gâmoo the orderly's care, and the consequent
necessity for continual fees. For Gâmoo piled up the shekels
until his master, after the mutiny, had reluctantly to hang him for
extorting blood, as well as shoe-money.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301007">They were a curious company, these palace guests, aliens in their
own country, speaking to none save high officials, caring to speak to
none, and waiting with ill-concealed yawns for the blunt dismissal or
the ceremonious leave-taking after a decent space of boredom due to
their rank.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301008">'I wonder they come,' said Mrs. Erlton, passing on rapidly to
escape from the loud remarks of two of her countrywomen who were
discussing Jewan Bukt's jewels as if the wearer, standing within a
yard of them, was a lay figure: as indeed he was to them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301009">'Why does any one come?' asked Captain Morecombe airily, as he
followed her across the terrace, and, leaning over the balustrade,
looked down at the sand-banks and streams below. 'So far as I am
concerned,' he went on, 'the reason is palpable. I came because I knew
you would be here, and I like to see my friends.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301011">He was in reality watching her to see how she received the remark,
and something in her face made him continue casually. 'And there, I
should say, are some other people who have similar excuse for
temporary aberration.' He pointed to the figures of a man and a woman
who were strolling towards the Koodsia along a narrow path which
curved below the embanking wall, and his sentence ended abruptly. He
turned hastily to lean his back on the parapet and look park-wards,
adding lightly, 'And there are two more,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301010" n="137 IN THE RESIDENCY"/> and two more! In fact most people really come to see
other people.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301012">But Kate Erlton was proud. She would have no evasion, and the past
three months since Christmas Day had forced her to accept facts.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301013">'It is my husband and Mrs. Gissing,' she said, looking towards the
strolling figures. 'I suppose he is seeing her home. I heard her say
not long ago she was tired. She hasn't been looking strong
lately.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301014">The indifference, being slightly overdone, annoyed her
companion. No man likes having the door slammed in his sympathetic
face. 'She is looking extremely pretty though,' he replied coolly. 'It
softens her somehow. Don't you agree with me?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301015">There was a pause ere Kate Erlton replied; and then her eyes had
found the far horizon instead of those lessening figures.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301016">'I do. I think she looks a better woman than she did--somehow.' She
spoke half to herself with a sort of dull wonder in her voice. But the
keenness of his, shown in his look at her, roused her reserve
instantly. To change the subject would be futile; she had gone too far
to make that possible if he wished otherwise, without that palpable
refusal which would in itself be confession. So she asked him promptly
if he would mind bringing her a glass of iced water, cup, anything,
since she was thirsty after the strawberries; and when he went off
reluctantly, took her retreat leaning over the balustrade, looking out
to the eastern plains beyond the river; to that far horizon which in
its level edge looked as if all or nothing might lie behind it. A new
world, or a great gulf!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301018">Three months! Three months since she had given up that chance, such
as it was, on Christmas Day. And now her husband was honestly, truly
in love with Alice Gissing. Would he have been as honestly, as truly
in love with her if--if she could have forgotten? Had this really been
his chance, and hers? Had it to come, somehow? She did not attempt to
deny facts; she was too proud for that. It seemed incredible, almost
impossible--but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> was no Lucknow flirtation, no mere sensual
<hi rend="italic">liaison</hi> on her husband's part. He was in love. The love which she
called real love, which, given to her, would, she admitted, have
raised her life<pb xml:id="fswater_1301017" n="138 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> above the
mere compromise from which she had shrunk. But he had never given it
to her. Never. Not even in those first days. And now, if that chance
had gone, what remained? What disgrace might not the future hold for
her boy's father with a man like Mr. Gissing, in a country where the
stealing of a man's wife from him was a criminal offence? Thank
heaven! Herbert was too selfish to risk--she turned and fled, as it
were, from that cause for gratitude to find refuge in the certainty
that Alice Gissing, at least, would not lose her head. But the chance!
the chance was gone.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301019">'Miffes Erlton,' came a little silvery voice behind her. 'Oh Miffes
Erlton! He's give-ded me suts a boo'ful birdie.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301020">It was Sonny clasping a quail in both dimpled hands. His bearer was
salaaming in rather a deprecatory manner, and a few paces off,
strolling back from the stables with a couple of young bloods like
himself, was Prince Abool-Bukr. All three with a furtive eye for Kate
Erlton's face and figure.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301021">'He give-ded it to me be-tos it tumbled down, and everbody
laughed,' went on Sonny confidently. 'And so I is do-ing to comfit
birdie, and 'ove it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301022">'Sonny!' exclaimed Kate, suddenly aghast, 'What's that on your
frock-down your arm?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301023">It was blood. Red, fresh-spilt blood! She was on her knees beside
him in an instant coaxing, comforting, unclasping his hands to see
where they were hurt. The bird fell from them fluttering feebly,
leaving them all scarlet-stained with its heart's blood, making Sonny
shriek at the sight, and hide face and hands in her muslin skirts. She
stood up again, her cheeks ablaze with anger, and turned on the
servant.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301024">'How dare you! How dare you give it to the <hi rend="italic">chola-sahib</hi>? How dare you?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301026">The man muttered something in broken English and Hindustani about a
quail-fight, and not knowing the bird was dying when the Mirza gave
it; accompanying his excuses with glances of appeal to Prince
Abool-Bukr, who at Sonny's outburst, had paused close by. Kate's eyes
following the bearer's, met those bright, dark, cruel ones, and her
wrath blazed out again. Her Hindustani, however, being unequal to a
lecture on cruelty to animals she had to be content with looks. The
Prince returned them with an indifferent smile for a moment, then with
a half-impatient shrug of his shoulders, he stepped forward, lifted
the dying quail gingerly<pb xml:id="fswater_1301025" n="139 IN THE RESIDENCY"/> between
finger and thumb, and flung it over the parapet into the river.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301027">'<hi rend="italic">Ab khutm piyâree, tussulli rukhiye</hi>!'
(Now is it finished, dear one; take comfort!) he said consolingly,
looking at Sonny's golden curls. The liquid Urdu was sheer gibberish
to the woman, but the child turned his head half-doubtfully,
half-reassured. Abool-Bukr's face softened instantly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301028">'<hi rend="italic">Mujhe muaâf. Murna sub ke hukk hai</hi>'
(Excuse me; death is the right of all), he said with a graceful salaam
as he passed on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301029">So the water Captain Morecombe brought back was used for a
different purpose than quenching pretended thirst; and the bringer,
hearing Kate's version of the story, hastily asked Sonny--who by this
time was holding out chubby hands cheerfully to be dried and prattling
of dirty birdies--what the Prince had said. The child, puzzled for an
instant, smiled broadly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301030">'He said it was deaded all light.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301031">Kate shivered. The incident had touched her on the nerves, taking
the colour from the flowers, the brightness from the sunshine.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301032">'Come and have a turn,' suggested Captain Morecombe, 'they have
began dancing in the saloon. It will change the subject.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301033">But as she took his arm, she said in rather a tremulous voice,
'There is such a thing as a Dance of Death, though.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301034">'My dear lady,' he laughed, 'it is a most excellent pastime. And
one can dance anywhere, on the edge of a volcano even, if one doesn't
smell brimstone.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301036">Kate, however, found otherwise, and when the waltz was over,
announced her intention of going off to take Sonny home, and see
Mrs. Seymour and the new baby. But in this her cavalier saw
difficulties. The mare was evidently too fresh for a lady to drive,
and Major Erlton returning might need the dog-cart. It would be far
better for him to drive her in his, so far, and afterwards let the
Major know he had to call for her. Kate assented wearily. Such
arrangements were part of the detail of life, with a woman neglected,
as she was, by her husband; she could not deliberately avoid them, and
yet keep the unconsciousness her pride claimed. How could she, when
there were twenty men in society to one woman? Twenty--for the most
part--gentlemen, quite capable of gauging a woman's character? So
Captain More<pb xml:id="fswater_1301035" n="140 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>combe drove her
to the Seymour's house on the city wall by the Water Bastion. There
were several houses there, set so close to the rampart that there was
barely room for a paved pathway between their back verandahs and the
battlement. In front of them lay a metalled road and shady gardens;
and at the end of this road stood a small bungalow towards which Kate
Erlton looked involuntarily. There was a horse waiting outside it. It
was her husband's charger. He must have arranged to have it sent down;
arranged, as it were, to leave her in the lurch, and a sudden flash of
resentment made her say, as she got down at the Seymour's house, 'You
had better call for me in half an hour; that will be best.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301037">Captain Morecombe flushed with sheer pleasure. Kate was not often
so encouraging. But as he drove round to wait for her at a friend's
house, close to the <hi rend="italic">Delhi Gazette</hi> press, he,
too, noticed the Major's charger, and swore under his breath. Before
God it was too bad! But if ever there were signs of a coming smash
they were to be seen here; for Erlton, after years of scandal had lost
his head--it seemed incredible, but there was a Fate in such things
from which mortal man could not escape.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301038">And as he told himself this tale of Fate--the man's excuse for the
inexcusable which will pass current gaily until women combine in
refusing to accept it for themselves--another man at the back of the
little house past which he was driving, was telling it to himself
also. For a great silence had fallen between Major Erlton and Alice
Gissing after she had told him something, to hear which, he had
arranged to come home with her for a quiet talk. And, in the silence,
the hollow note of the wooden bells upon the necks of the cattle
grazing below the battlement, over which he leant, seemed to count the
slow minutes. Quaintest, dumbest of all sounds, lacking vibration
utterly, yet mellow, musical, to the fanciful ear, with something of
the hopeless persistency of Time in its recurring beat.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301039">Alice Gissing was not a fanciful woman, but as she lay back in her
long cane chair, her face hidden in its pillows as if to shut out
something unwelcome, her foot kept time to the persistency on the
pavement, till, suddenly, she sat up and faced round on her silent
companion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301040">'Well,' she said, impatiently. 'Well! what have you got to
say?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301041" n="141 IN THE RESIDENCY"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301042">'I--I was thinking,' he began,
helplessly, when she interrupted him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301043">'What is the use of thinking? That won't alter facts. As I told
you, Gissing will be back in a month or so; and then we must
decide.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301044">Major Erlton turned quickly. 'You can't go back to him Allie, you
weren't considering that surely. You can't--not--not now.' His voice
softened over the last words; he turned away abruptly. His face was
hidden from her so.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301045">She looked towards him strangely for a second, covered her face
with her hands for another, then, changing the very import of the
action, used them to brush the hair back from her temples; so,
clasping them behind her head, leant back on the pillows, and looked
towards him again. There was a reckless defiance in her attitude and
expression, but her words did not match it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301046">'I suppose I can't,' she said drearily, 'and I suppose you wouldn't
let me go away by myself either.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301047">Once more he turned. 'Go!' he echoed, quickly. 'Where would you
go?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301048">'Somewhere!'--the recklessness had invaded her voice
now--'Anywhere! Wherever women do go in these cases. To the devil
perhaps.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301049">He gave a queer kind of laugh; this spirited effrontery had always
roused his admiration. 'I daresay,' he replied, 'for I'm not a saint,
and you have got to come with me, Allie. You must. I shall send in my
papers, and by-and-by, when all the fuss is over'--here he gave a
fierce sigh--'for I expect Gissing will make a fuss, we can get
married and live happily ever after.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301050">She shook her head. 'You'll regret it. I don't see how you can help
regretting it!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301051">He came over to her, and laid his big broad hand very tenderly on
her curly hair. 'No! I shan't, Allie,' he replied in a low, husky
voice, 'I shan't, indeed. I never was a good hand at sentiment and
that sort, but I love you dearly--dearly. All the more--for this that
you've told me. I'd do anything for you, Allie. Keep straight as a
die, dear, if you wanted it. And I wasn't regretting--it--just now. I
was only thinking how strange--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301053">'Strange!' she interrupted, almost fiercely.	'If it is strange to
you, what must it be to me? My God! I wonder<pb xml:id="fswater_1301052" n="142 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> if any man will ever understand what this means to a
woman? All the rest seems to pass her by, to leave no
mark--I--I--never cared. But this! Herbert! I feel sometimes as if I
were Claude's wife again--Claude's wife so full of hopes and
fears. And I dream of him too. I haven't dreamt of him for years, and
I learnt to hate him before he died, you know. I have gone back to
that old time, and nothing seems different. Nothing at all! Isn't that
strange? And the old Mai--she has gone back, too--sees no difference
either. She treats me just as she did in those old, old days. She
fusses round, and cockers me up, and talks about it. There! she is
coming now with smelling-salts or sal-volatile or something! Oh! Go
away, do, Mai, I don't want anything except to be left alone!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301054">But the old ayah's untutored instincts were not to be so easily
smothered. Her wrinkled face beamed as she insisted on changing the
dainty laced shoes for easy slippers, and tucked another pillow into
the chair. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was tired, she told the
Major with a respectful salaam, after her long walk; the faint
resentment in her tone being entirely for the latter fact.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301055">'You see, don't you ?' said Mrs. Gissing, with bright reckless
eyes, when they were alone once more. 'She doesn't mind. She has
forgotten all the years between, forgotten everything. And I--I don't
know why--But there! What is the use of asking questions? I never can
answer even for myself. So we had better leave it alone for the
present. We needn't settle yet awhile, and there is always a chance of
something happening.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301056">'But you said your husband would be back,' he began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301057">'In a month--but we may all be dead and buried in a month,' she
interrupted. 'I only told you now, because I thought you ought to know
soon, so as not to be hurried at the last. It means a lot, you see,
for a man to give up his profession for a woman; and it isn't like
England, you know--' she paused, then continued in an odd half-anxious
voice, her eyes fixed on him inquiringly as he stood beside her. 'I
shouldn't be angry, remember, Herbert, if--if you didn't.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301058">'Allie! What do you mean? Do you mean that you don't care?' His
tone was full of pained surprise, his hand scarcely a willing agent as
she drew it close to caress it with her cheek.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301059" n="143 IN THE RESIDENCY"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301060">'Care? of course I care. You are very good to me Herbert, far nicer
to me than you are to other people. And I can't say "no" if you decide
on giving up for me. I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> now. I see
that. Only don't let us be in a hurry. As that big fat man in the
tight satin trousers said to the Resident to-day, when he was asked
what the people in the city thought of the fuss down country '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301061">'<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust?</hi> What the devil does that
mean?' asked the Major, his brief doubt soothed by the touch of her
soft cheek. 'You are such a clever little cat, Allie! You know a
deuced sight more than I do. How you pick it up I can't think.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301062">She gave one of her inconsequent laughs. 'Don't have so many men
anxious to explain things to you as I have, I expect, sir! But if you
ever spoke to a native here--which you don't--you'd know <hi rend="italic">that</hi>. Even my old Mai says it--they all say it when
they don't want to tell the truth, or be hurried, and that is
generally. 'Delhi is far,' they say. Dr. Macintyre translates it as
'It's a far cry to Lochawe;' but I don't understand that; for it was
an old King of Delhi who said it first. People came and told him an
enemy had crossed his border. '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dar ust</hi>,'
says he. Can't you see him, Herbert? An old Turk of a thing with those
tight satin trousers! Then they told him the enemy was in sight. <hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust</hi>,' said he. And he said it when they
were at the gate--he said it when their swords--' the dramatic
instinct in her was strong, and roused her into springing to her feet
and mimicking the thrust. '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301063">Her gay mocking voice rang loud. Then she laid her hand lightly on
his arm. 'Let us say it too, dear,' she said almost sharply. 'I won't
think--yet. "<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust.</hi>"'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301064">The memory of the phrase went with him when he had said good-bye,
and was pacing his chager towards the Post Office. But it only
convinced him that the Delhi of his decision was reached; he would
chuck everything for Allie.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301066">It was by this time growing dusk, but he could see two figures
standing in the verandah of the Press Office, and one of them called
him by name. He turned in at the gate to find Captain Morecombe
reading a proof-sheet by the light of a swinging lamp; for Jim Douglas
drew back into unrecognisable shadow as he approached. He had
purposely kept out of Major Erlton's way during his occasional returns
to Delhi, and as he stepped back now he asked himself if he<pb xml:id="fswater_1301065" n="144 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> hated the big man most for his
own sake, or for hate's, or for that other little woman's. Not that it
mattered a jot, since he hated him cordially on all three scores.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301067">'Bad news from Barrackpore, Erlton,' said the captain, 'And as I
have to drive Mrs. Erlton home I thought you might take it round to
the Brigadier's. At least if you have no objection, Douglas?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301068">'None. The telegram is all through the bazaar by now. You can't
help it if you employ natives.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301070">'Through the medium of a private telegram,' read Captain Morecombe,
'the following startling news has reached our office. On Sunday (the
29th March) about 4.30 <hi rend="smallcaps">P.M.</hi>, a Brahmin Sepoy
of the 34th N. I.'--that's the missionary fellow Wheler's regiment, of
course--'went amuck, and rushing to the quarter-guard with his musket,
ordered the bugler to sound the assembly to all who desired to keep
the faith of their fathers. The guard, ordered to arrest him,
refused. The whole regiment being, it is said, in alarm at the arrival
that morning of the first detachment of British troops, detailed to
keep order during the approaching disbandment of the 19th for mutiny;
rumour having it that all sepoys then refusing to become Christians
would he shot down at once. The mutineer, who had been drinking hemp,
actually fired at Sergeant-major Hewson, providentially missing him;
subsequently he fired at the adjutant, who, after a hand-to-hand
scuffle with the madman, in which Hewson joined, only escaped with his
life through the aid of a faithful Mohammedan orderly. Until, and,
indeed, after Colonel Wheler the Commandant arrived on the parade
ground, the mutineer marched up and down in front of the guard,
flourishing his musket and calling for his comrades to join him. The
Colonel, therefore, ordered the guard to advance and shoot the man
down. The men made show of obedience, but after a few steps they
refused to go on, unless accompanied by a British officer. On this,
Colonel Wheler, considering the risk needless with an unreliable guard
already half-mutinous, rode off to report his failure to the Brigadier
who had halted on the further side of the parade ground. At this
juncture (about 5.30 <hi rend="smallcaps">P.M.</hi>) matters looked
most serious. The 43rd N. I. had turned out, and were barely
restrained from rushing their bells of arms by the entreaties of their
native officers. The 34th, beyond control altogether, were watching
the mutineer's unchecked<pb xml:id="fswater_1301069" n="145 IN THE RESIDENCY"/> defiance
with growing sympathy. Fortunately at this moment General Hearsey
commanding the Division rode up followed by his two sons as
<hi rend="italic">aides</hi>. Hearing what had occurred from the group of officers awaiting
further developments, he galloped over to the guard, ordered them to
follow him and made straight for the mutineer; shouting back, 'Damn
his musket, sir!' to an officer who warned him it was loaded. But
seeing the man kneel to take aim he called to his son, 'If I fall,
John, rush in and put him to death somehow.' The precaution was,
providentially, unnecessary, for the mutineer, seeing the remaining
officers join in this resolute advance, turned his musket on
himself. He is not expected to live. Adjutant Baugh, a most promising
young officer is, we regret to say, dangerously wounded.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301071">'Treacherous black devils! I'd shoot 'em down like dogs--the lot of
them,' said Major Erlton savagely. He had slipped from his horse and
now stood in the verandah overlooking the proof, his back to Jim
Douglas. Perhaps it was the closer sight of his enemy's face which
roused the latter's temper; anyhow he broke into the conversation with
that nameless challenge in his voice which makes a third person
nervous--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301072">'It is a pity you were not at Barrackpore. They seem to have been
in need of a good pot-shot--even of an officer to be potted at--till
Hearsey came to the front.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301073">Captain Morecambe turned quickly to put up his sword as it
were. 'By the way, Erlton,' he said hastily, 'I don't think you know
Douglas, though you tried to see him at Nujjufghur after he saved
Mrs. Gissing from that snake.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301074">But Jim Douglas's temper grew, partly at his own fatuity in risking
the now inevitable encounter--and he had a vile uncontrollable temper
when he was in the wrong.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301075">'Major Erlton and I have met before,' he interrupted turning to go;
'but I doubt if he will recognise me. Possibly his horse may.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301076">He paused as he spoke before the Arab which stood waiting. It
whinnied instantly, stretching its head towards its old master. Major
Erlton muttered a startled exclamation, but regained his
self-possession instantly. 'I beg your pardon--Mr.--er--Douglas I
think you said, Morecombe; but I did not recognise you--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301077">The pause was aggressive to the last degree.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301078" n="146 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301079">'Under that name, you mean,' finished Jim Douglas, white with anger
at being so obviously at a disadvantage. 'The fact is, Captain
Morecombe, that as the late King of Oude's trainer I called myself
James Greyman. I sold that Arab to Major Erlton under that name, and
under--well--rather peculiar circumstances. I am quite ready to tell
them if Major Erlton thinks them likely to interest the general
public.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301080">His eyes met his enemy's fiercely, getting back now full measure of
sheer, wild, vicious temper. Everything else had gone to the winds,
and they would have been at each others' throats gladly; scarcely
remembering the cause of quarrel, and forgetting it utterly with the
first grip, as men will do to the end of time.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301081">Then the Major, being less secure of his ground since fighting was
out of the question, turned on his heel. 'So far as I'm concerned,' he
said, 'the explanation is sufficient. Give the devil his due and every
man his chance.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301082">The innuendo was again unmistakable; but the words reminded Jim
Douglas of an almost-forgotten promise, and he bit his lips over the
necessity for silence; but in that--as he knew well--lay his only
refuge from his own temper; it was silence, or speech to the
uttermost.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301083">'If you have quite done with the proof, Captain Morecombe,' he said
very ceremoniously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301084">'Certainly, certainly. Thanks for letting me see it,' interrupted
the Captain, who had been looking from one to the other doubtfully, as
most men do even when their dearest friends are implicated, if the
cause of quarrel is a horse. 'It is a serious business,' he went on
hurriedly to help the diversion. 'After all the talk and fuss, this
cutting down of an officer--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301085">'Is first blood,' put in Jim Douglas. 'There will be more spilt
before long.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301086">'Disloyal scoundrels!' growled Major Erlton wrathfully. 'Idiots! As
if they had a chance!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301087">'They have none. That's the pity of it,' retorted his adversary as
he rode off quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301089">Ay! that was the pity of it! The pity of blood to be spilt
needlessly. The thought made him slacken speed, as if he were on the
threshold of a graveyard, though he could not foresee the blood to be
spilt so wantonly in that very garden-set angle of the city, so full
now of the scent of<pb xml:id="fswater_1301088" n="147 IN THE RESIDENCY"/> flowers, the
sounds of security. From far came the subdued hum which rises from a
city in which there is no wheeled traffic, no roar of machinery, only
the feet of men, their tears, their laughter, to assail the
irresponsive air. Nearer, among the scattered houses hidden by trees,
rose children's voices playing about the servants' quarters. Across
the now empty playground of the college the outlines of the church
showed faintly among the fret of branches upon the dull red sky which
a cloudless sunset leaves behind it; and through the open arch of the
Kashmir gate, the great globe of the full moon grew slowly from the
ruddy earth-haze. Then loud and clear came the chime of seven from the
mainguard gong, and the rattle of arms dying into silence again. The
peace of it all seemed unassailable, the security unending.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301090">'<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301091">The words were called across the road in a woman's voice, making
him turn to see a shadowy white figure outlined against the dark
arches of a verandah close upon the road. He reined up his horse
almost involuntarily, remembering as he did so that this was
Mrs. Gissing's house.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301092">'I beg your pardon--' he began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301093">'I beg yours,' came the instant reply. 'I mistook you for a
friend. Good-night!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301094">'Good-night!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301095">As he paced his horse on, choosing the longer way to Duryagung, by
the narrow lanes clinging to the city wall, the remembrance of that
frank good-night lingered with him. <hi rend="italic">For a
friend</hi>! What a name to call Herbert Erlton! Poor little soul! The
thought, by its very intolerableness, drove him back to the other
roused by her first words--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301096">'<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301097">True! Even this Delhi lying before his very eyes was far from
him. How would it take the news which by now, as he had said, must
have filtered through the bazaar? He could imagine that. He knew also,
that the Palace folk must all be discussing the Resident's garden
party, with a view to their own special aims and objects. But what did
they think of the outlook on the future? Did they also say '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur us</hi>?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301099">One of them was saying it on a roof close by. It was Abool-Bukr,
who on his way home had given himself the promised pleasure of
retailing his virtuous afternoon's experiences to Newâsi; for
his two-months-wed bride had not<pb xml:id="fswater_1301098" n="148  ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> broken <hi rend="italic">him</hi> of his habit of coming to
his kind one, though it had made <hi rend="italic">her</hi> graver,
more dignified. Still she broke in on his thick assertion--for he had
drunk brandy in his efforts to be frieiidly with the <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi>--that he had seen an Englishwoman of her
sort, with the quick query:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301100">'Like me! How so?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301101">He laughed mischievously. 'And thou art not jealous of my wife!--or
sayest thou art not! She was but like thee in this, aunt, that she is
of the sort who would have men better than God made them--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301102">'No worse, thou meanest,' she replied.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301103">He shook his head. 'Women, Newâsi, are as the ague. A man is
ever being made better or worse till he knows not if he be well or
ill. And both ways God's work is marred, a man driven from his right
fate--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301104">'But if a man mistakes his fate as thou dost, Abool,' she
persisted. 'Sure, if Jewun Bukht with that evil woman, Zeenut--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301105">He started to his feet, thrusting out lissome hands wildly as if to
set aside some thought. 'Have a care, Newâsi, have a care!' he
cried. 'Talk not of that arch plotter, arch dreamer. Nay! not arch
dreamer! 'tis thou that dreamest most. Dreamest of war without blood,
men without passion, me without myself! Was there not blood on my
hands ere ever I was born--I Abool-Bukr of the race of Timoor-kings,
tyrants, by birth and trade?--the blood of those who stood in my
father's way and my father's fathers. I tell thee there is too much
tinder yonder--' he pointed to where, across the flat chequers of
moonlit roofs, inlaid by the shadows of the intersecting alleys, the
cupolas of the Palace gates rose upon the sky. 'There is too much
tinder here'--he struck his own breast fiercely, 'for such fiery
thoughts. Why canst not leave me alone, woman?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301106">She drew back coldly. 'Do I ask thee to come hither--Thy
wife--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301107">He gave a half-maudlin laugh. 'Nay, I mean not that; Sure thou art
very woman, Newâsi! That is why I love mine aunt! That is why I
come to see her--that--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301108">She interrupted him hastily, but her eyes grew soft, her voice
trembled.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301109">'And I do but goad thee for thine own good, Abool. These are
strange times. Even the Mufti <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301111">'Ah! defend me from his wise saws. I know the ring of<pb xml:id="fswater_1301110" n="149 THE YELLOW FAKEER"/> them too well as 'tis. Even that I
endure--for mine aunt's sake. Though, by the faith, if he and others
of his kidney waylay me as they do much longer, I will have a
rope-ladder to thy roof and scandalise them all. I can stomach thy
wisdom, dear; none else. So tell them that Abool-Bukr can quote saws
as well as they. Tell them he lives for Pleasure and Pleasure lives in
the present. For the rest, '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust! Delhi dur
ust</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301112">His reckless unrestrained voice rang out over the roofs, and into
the alley below where Jim Douglas was telling himself, that with his
finger on the very pulse of the city he had failed to count its heart
beats.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301113">He looked up quickly. '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust</hi>.' All
the world seemed to be saying it that night; though the first blood
had been shed in the quarrel.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0206" n="6" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI<lb/>THE YELLOW FAKEER</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301114">THE days passed to weeks, the weeks to a month, after that shedding
of first blood, and no more was spilt, save that of the shedders. Two
of them were duly hanged, the regiment ordered to be disbanded. For
the rest, though causeless fires broke out in every cantonment, though
a Sikh orderly divulged to his master some tale of a concerted rising,
though the dread of the greased cartridge grew to a perfect panic,
even Jim Douglas, with his eyes wide open, was forced to admit that,
so far as any chance of action went, the reply might still be '<hi rend="italic">Delhi dur ust</hi>.' The sky was dark indeed, there were
mutterings on the horizon; but he and others remembered how often in
India, even when rain is due, the clouds creep up and up day by day,
darker and more lowering, until the yellowing crops seem to grow
greener in sheer hope of the purple pall above them. And then some
unseen Hand juggles those portentous rain-clouds into the daily
darkness of night, and some dawn rises clear and dry to show, in its
fierce blaze of sunlight, how the yellow has gained on the green.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301116">So, day by day, the impression grew amongst the elect, that the
storm signals would pass; that the best policy was<pb xml:id="fswater_1301115" n="150 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> to tide over the next few months somehow. In
pursuance of which a sepoy who ventured to draw attention to the state
of feeling in one regiment was publicly told he need expect no
promotion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301117">But there were dissentients to this policy, apparently. Anyhow, in
the end of April Colonel Carmichael Smyth, commanding the 3rd Bengal
Cavalry at Meerut, returned from leave one evening, and ordered
fifteen men from each troop to be picked out to learn the use of the
new cartridge next morning, and then went to bed comfortably. The men,
through their native officers, appealed to their captain for delay,
saying they were neither prepared to take nor to refuse the
cartridges, old or new. No answer was given them. They marched to the
parade obediently at sunrise, and eighty-five of the ninety men picked
from a picked regiment for smartness and intelligence refused to take
the cartridges, even from their Colonel's or the Adjutant's
hand. Their own troop officers were not present. They were at once
tried by a court-martial of native officers, some of whom came from
the regiments at Delhi--but thirty odd miles off along a broad, level,
driving road. They were sentenced to ten years penal servitude, and a
parade of all troops was ordered for sunrise on the 9th of May, to put
the sentence into force.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301118">So the night of the 8th found Jim Douglas riding over from Delhi in
the cool to see something which, if anything could, ought to turn mere
talk into action. It had brought a new sound into the air already; the
clang of cold iron upon hot, rising from the regimental smithy where
the fetters for the eighty-five were being forged. A cruel sound at
best, proclaiming the indubitable advantage of coolness and hardness
over glow and plasticity. Cruel indeed when the hardness and
insistency goes to the forging of fetters for emotion and
ignorance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301119">Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301120">The sound rang out into the hot airless night, rang out into the
gusty dawn; for it takes time to forge eight-five pairs of
shackles. Rang out to where a mixed guard of the 11th and 20th
Regiments of Native Infantry were waiting round the tumbrils for the
last fetter. The grey of dawn showed the rest piled on the tumbrils,
showed two English officers on horseback talking to each other a
little way off, showed the faces of the guard dark and lowering like
the dawn itself.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301121" n="151 THE YELLOW FAKEER"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301122">'<hi rend="italic">Loh!</hi> sergeant-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>!
there is the last,' said the master-armourer cheerfully. His task was
done, at any rate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301123">Soma took it from him silently, and flung it on the others almost
fiercely; it settled among them with a clank. His regiment, the 11th,
had but newly come to Meerut, and therefore had as yet no ties of
personal comradeship with the eighty-five; but fetters for any sepoys
were enough to make the pulse beat full and heavy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301124">'The last! thank Heaven,' said the captain, giving his bridle rein
a jag. 'All right forward, Jones! Then fall in, men. Quick march! We
are late enough as it is.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301125">The disciplined feet fell in without a waver, the tumbrils moved on
with a clank and a creak.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301126">Quick march! Soma's mind, fair reflection of the minds of all about
him, was full of doubt. Was that indeed the last fetter, or did Rumour
say sooth when it told of others being secretly forged? Who could say
in these days, when the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> themselves had
taken to telling lies. Not his <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> as yet;
his Colonels and Captains and Majors, even the little <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, who laughed over his own mistakes on parade,
told the truth still. But the others lied. Lied about enlistment,
about prize-money and leave, about those cartridges. At least, so the
men in the 20th said; the sergeant marching next to him behind the
tumbril most of all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301127">''Tis but three weeks longer, comrade,' said this man suddenly in a
low whisper. They were treading the dim deserted outskirts of the
cantonment bazaar, and Soma looked round nervously at the officers
behind. Had they heard? He frowned at the speaker and made no
reply. He gave a deaf ear, when he could, to the talk in the 20th; but
that was not always, for its sepoys were part of the Bengal army. That
army which was not--as a European army is--a mere chance collection of
men divided from each other in the beginning and end of life,
associated loosely with each other in its middle, and using military
service as a make-shift; but, to a great extent, a guild, following
the profession of arms by hereditary custom from the cradle to the
grave.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301129">Quick march! A woman, early astir, peered at the little procession
through the chink of a door, and whispered to an unseen companion
behind. What was she saying? What, by implication, would other women,
who peeped virtuously--women he knew--say of his present occupation?
That he<pb xml:id="fswater_1301128" n="152 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> was a coward to be
guarding his comrades' fetters?' No doubt, since others with less
right would say it too. All the miserable disreputable riff-raff, for
instance, which had drifted in from the neighbourhood to see the
show. The bazaar had been full of it these three days past. Even the
sweepers, pariahs, out-castes, would snigger over the misfortunes of
their betters--as those two ahead were doubtless sniggering already as
they drew aside from their slave's work of sweeping the roadway, to
let the tumbrils pass; drew aside with mock deference, leaving
scantiest room for the twice-born following them. So scant, indeed,
that the outermost tip of a reed broom, flourished in insolent salaam,
touched the Rajpoot's sleeve. It was the veriest brush, no more than a
fly's wing could have given; but the half-stifled cry from Soma's lips
meant murder--nothing less. His disciplined feet wavered, he gave a
furtive glance at his companions. Had they seen the insult? Could they
use it against him?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301130">'Eyes front there; forward!' came the order from behind, and he
pulled himself together by instinct and went on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301131">'Only three weeks longer, brother!' said that voice beside him
meaningly; and a dull rage rose in Soma's heart. So it had been
seen. It might be said of him, Soma, that he had tamely submitted to a
defiling touch. He did not look round at his officers this time. They
might hear if they chose, the future might hold what it chose. Mayhap
they had seen the insult and were laughing at it. They were not his
<hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi>; they belonged to the man at his side
who had the right to taunt him. As a matter of fact, they were
discussing the chances of their ponies in next week's races; but Soma,
lost in a great wrath, a great fear, made it, inevitably, the topic of
the whole world.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301133">Hark! The bugle for the Rifles to form; they were to come to the
parade loaded with ball cartridge. And that rumble was the Artillery,
loaded also, going to take up their position. By-and-bye, the
Carabineers would sweep with a clatter and a dash to form the third
side of the hollow square, whereof the fourth was to be a mass of
helpless dark faces, with the eighty-five martyrs and the tumbrils in
the middle. Soma had seen it all in general orders, talked it over
with his clearest friend, and called it tyranny. And now the tumbrils
clanked past a little heap of smouldering ashes,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301132" n="153    THE YELLOW FAKEER"/> that but the day before had been a guard-house. The
lingering smoke from this last work of the incendiary drifted
northward, after the fetters, making one of the officers cough. But he
went on talking of his ponies, true type of the race which lives to
make mistakes, and dies to retrieve them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301134">'Quick march!' he called, as the feet before him lingered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301135">Streams of spectators bound for the show began to overtake them,
ready with comments on what Soma guarded. And on the broad white Mall,
dividing the native half of cantonments and the town of Meerut from
the European portion, more than one carriage with a listless
white-faced woman in it dashed by, on its way to see the show.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301136">Quick march! Whatever else might be possible in the future, that
was all now, midway between the barracks of the Rifles and the
Carabineers, with the Church mute symbol of the horror which day by
day, month by month, had been closing in round the people blocking the
way in front. So they passed on to the wide northern parade ground,
with that hollow square ready; three sides of it threatening weapons,
the fourth of unarmed men and in the centre the eighty-five picked men
of a picked regiment.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301137">The knot of European spectators round the flag listened with yawns
to the stout General's exordium. The eighty-five being hopelessly,
helplessly in the wrong by military law, there seemed no need to
insist on the fact. And the mass of dark faces standing within range
of loaded guns and rifles, within reach of glistening sabres, did not
listen at all. Not that it mattered, since the units in that crowd had
lost the power of accepting facts. Even Soma, standing to attention
beside the tumbrils, only felt a great sense of outrage, of wrong, of
injustice somewhere. And there was one Englishman, at least, rigid to
attention also before his disarmed, dismounted, yet loyal troop, who
must have felt it also, unless he was more than human. And this was
Captain Craigie who, when his men appealed to him to save them--to
delay this unnecessary musketry parade--had written in his haste to
the Adjutant, '<hi rend="italic">Go to Smyth at once!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301138">'<hi rend="italic">Go to Smyth!</hi>' and Smyth was his colonel!
Incredible lack of official etiquette; repeated hardily, moreover.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301139">'<hi rend="italic">Pray don't lose a moment, but go to Smyth and
tell him.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301141">What? Only '<hi rend="italic">that this is a most serious matter,
and we may<pb xml:id="fswater_1301140" n="154 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> have the whole
regiment in open mutiny in half-an-hour if it is not attended
to.</hi>' Only that! So it is to be hoped that Captain Craigie had the
official wigging for his unconventional appeal in his pocket as he
shared his regiment's disgrace, to serve him as a warning or a
consolation!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301142">And now, the pompous monotone being ended, the silence--coming
after the clankings and buglings and trampings which had been going on
since dawn--was almost oppressive. The three sides of steel, even the
fourth of faces, however, showed no sign; they stood as stone while
the eighty-five were stripped of their uniforms. But there was more to
come. By the General's orders the leg-irons were to be rivetted on one
by one; and so, once more, the sound of iron upon iron recurred
monotonously, making the silence of the intervals still more
oppressive, for the prisoners at first seemed stunned by the isolation
from even their as yet unfettered comrades. But suddenly from a single
throat came that cry for justice, which has a claim to a hearing; at
least, in the estimation of the people of India.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301143">'<hi rend="italic">Dohai! Dohai! Dohai!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301144">Soma gave a sort of sigh, and a faint quiver of expectation passed
over the sea of dark faces.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301145">Clang! Clang! The hammers, going on unchecked, were the only
answer. Those three sides of stone had come to see a thing done, and
it must be done--the sooner the better. But the rivetting of
eighty-five pairs of leg-irons is not to be done in a moment, and so
the cry grew clamorous.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301146">'<hi rend="italic">Dohai! Dohai!</hi>' Had they not fought
faithfully in the past? Had they not been deceived? Had they had a
fair chance?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301147">But the hammers went on as the sun climbed out of the dust-haze to
gleam on the sloped sabres, glint on the loaded guns, and send
glittering streaks of light along the rifles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301148">So the cry changed. Were their comrades cowards to stand by and see
this tyranny and raise no finger of help? Oh! curses on them! 'Tis
they were degraded, dishonoured. Curses on the Colonel who had forced
them to this. Curses on every white face!--curses on every face which
stood by--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301150">One, close to the General's flag, broke suddenly into passionate
resentment. Jim Douglas drew out his watch, looked at it, and gathered
his reins together. 'An hour<pb xml:id="fswater_1301149" n="155 THE YELLOW FAKEER"/> and
forty-five minutes already. I'm off, Ridgeway. I can't stand this
d----d folly any more.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301151">'My dear fellow, speak lower! If the General--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301152">'I don't care who hears me,' retorted Jim Douglas recklessly as he
steered through the crowd, followed by his friend, 'I say it is d----d
inconceivable folly and tyranny. Come on, and let's have a gallop, for
God's sake, and get rid of that devilish sound.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301153">The echo of their horses' resounding hoofs covered, obliterated it;
the wind of their own swiftness seemed to blow the tension away. So,
after a spin due north for a mile or two, they paused at the edge of a
field where the oxen were circling placidly round on the
threshing-floors, and a group of women were taking advantage of the
gustiness to winnow. Their bare brown arms glistened above the falling
showers of golden grain, their unabashed smiling faces showed against
the clouds of golden chaff drifting behind them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301154">Jim Douglas looked at them for a moment, returned the salaam of the
men driving the oxen and forking the straw, then turned his horse
towards the cantonment again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301155">'It is nothing to them; that's one comfort,' he said. 'But they
will have to suffer for it in the end I expect. Who will believe when
the time comes that this'--he gave a backward wave of his hand--'went
on unwitting of that?'--he gave a forward one.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301156">His companion following his look to where, in the far distance, a
faint cloud of dust telling of many feet hung on the horizon, said
suddenly, as if the sight brought remembrance: 'By George! Douglas,
how steady the sepoys stood, I half expected a row.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301157">'Steadier than I should,' remarked the other grimly. 'Well! I hope
Smyth is satisfied. To return from leave and drive your regiment into
mutiny in twelve hours is a record performance.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301158">His hearer who was a civilian gave a deprecating cough. 'That's a
bit hard, surely. I happen to know that he heard while on leave some
story about a concerted rising later on. He may have done it
purposely, to force their hands.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301160">Jim Douglas shrugged his shoulders. 'Did he warn you what he was
about to do? Did he allow time to prepare others for his private
mutiny? My dear Ridgeway, it was<pb xml:id="fswater_1301159" n="156 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> put on official record two months ago that an organised
scheme for resistance existed in every regiment between Calcutta and
Peshawur; so Smyth might at least have consulted the colonels of the
other two regiments at Meerut. As it is, the business has strained the
loyalty of the most loyal to the uttermost; and we deserve to suffer,
we do indeed.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301161">'You don't mince matters, certainly,' said the civilian drily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301162">'Why should anybody mince them? Why can't we admit boldly--the
C.-in-C. did it on the sly the other day--that the cartridges are
suspicious? that they leave the muzzle covered with a fat, like
tallow? Why don't we admit it was tallow at first. Why not, at any
rate, admit we are in a hole, instead of refusing to take the common
precaution of having an ammunition waggon loaded up for fear it should
be misconstrued into alarm? Is there no medium between bribing
children with lollipops and torturing them--keeping tnem on the
strain, under fire as it were, for hours watching their best friends
punished unjustly.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301163">'Unjustly?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301164">'Yes. To their minds unjustly. And you know what forcible injustice
means to children--and these are really children--simple, ignorant,
obstinate'--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301165">They had come back to cantonments again and were rapidly overtaking
the now empty tumbrils going home, for the parade was over. Further
down the road, raising a cloud of dust from their shackled feet, the
eighty-five were being marched jailwards under a native escort.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301166">'Well!' said the civilian drily, 'I would give a great deal to know
what those simple babes really thought of us.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301167">'Hate us stock and block for the time. I should,' replied Jim
Douglas. They were passing the tumbrils at the moment, and one of the
guard, in sergeant's uniform, looked up in joyful recognition.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301168">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! It is I, Soma.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301169">The civilian looked at his companion oddly when, after a minute or
two spent in answering Soma's inquiries as to where and how the master
was to be found, Jim Douglas rode alongside once more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301170">'Out a bit; eh ?' he said drily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301172">'Very much out ; but they are a queer lot. Do you remember the
story of the self-made American who was told his boast relieved the
Almighty of a very great<pb xml:id="fswater_1301171" n="157 THE YELLOW FAKEER"/>
responsibility. Well, He is only responsible for one half of the
twice-born. The other is due to humanity, to heredity, what you will!
That is what makes these high caste men so difficult to deal
with. They are twice-born--Yes! they are a queer lot.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301173">He repeated the remark with even greater fervour twelve hours later
when, about midnight, he started on his return ride to Delhi; for
though he had spent the whole day in listening, he had scarcely heard
a word of blame for the scene which had roused him to wrath that
morning. The sepoys had gone about their duties as if nothing had
happened, and despite the undoubted presence of a lot of loose
characters in the bazaar, there had been no disturbance. He laughed
cynically to himself at the waste of a day which would have been
better spent in horse-dealing. This, however, settled it. If this
intolerable tyranny failed to rouse action there could be no immediate
danger ahead. To a big cantonment like Meerut, the biggest in northern
India, with two thousand British troops in it, even the prospect of a
rising was not serious; at Delhi, however, where there were only
native troops, it might have been different. But now he felt that a
handful of resolute men ought to be able to hold their own anywhere
against such aimless, invertebrate discontent. He felt a vague
disappointment that it should be so, that the pleasant cool of night
should be so quiet, so peaceful. They were a poor lot who could do
nothing but talk!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301174">As he rode through the station the mess-houses were still alight,
and the gay voices of the guests who had been dining at a large
bungalow, bowered in gardens, reached his ears distinctly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301175">'It's the Sabbath already,' said one. 'Ought to be in our
beds!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301176">'Hooray! for a Europe morning,' came a more boyish one breaking
into a carol, '<hi rend="italic">Of all the days within the week, I
dearly love--</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301177">'Shut up, Fitz! ' put in a third, 'you'll wake the General!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301178">'What's the odds. He can sleep all day. I'm sure his buggy-charger
needs a rest.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301179">'Do shut up, Fitz! The Colonel will hear you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301180">'I don't care. It's Scriptural. <hi rend="italic">Thou and thy ox
and thy ass--</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301182">'You promised to come to evening church, Mr. Fitzgerald,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301181" n="158 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> interrupted a reproachful
feminine voice; 'you said you would sing in the choir.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301183">'Did I? Then I'll come. It will wake me up for dinner; besides, I
shall sit next you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301184">The last words came nearer, softer; Mr. Fitzgerald was evidently
riding home beside some one's carriage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301185">Pleasant and peaceful indeed! that clank of a sentry, here and
there, only giving a greater sense of security. Not that it was
needed, for here beyond cantonments, the houses of the clerks and
civilians lay as peaceful, as secure. In the verandah of one of them,
close to the road, a bearer was walking up and down crooning a patient
lullaby to the restless fair-haired child in his arms.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301186">No! truly there could be no fear. It was all talk! He set spurs to
his horse and went on through the silent night at a hand-gallop, for
he had another beast awaiting him half-way and he wished to be in
Delhi by dawn. There was a row of tall trees bordering the road on
either side, making it dark, and through their swiftly passing boles
the level country stretched to the paler horizon like a sea. And as he
rode, he sat in judgment in his thoughts on those dead levels and the
people who lived in them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301187">Stagnant!--featureless!--A dead sea!--A mere waste of waters
without form or void! Not even ready for a spirit to move over them;
for if that morning's work left them apathetic, the Moulvie of Fyzabad
himself need preach no Voice of God. For <hi rend="italic">this</hi>,
surely--this sense of injustice to others, must be the strongest
motive, the surest word to conjure with?--that dull dead beat of iron
upon the fetters of others,--which he still seemed to hear,--the
surest call to battle?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301188">He paused in his thought, wondering if what he fancied he heard was
but an echo from memory, or a real sound! Real; undoubtedly. It was
the distant clang of the iron bells upon oxen. That meant that he must
be seven or eight miles out, half-way to the next stage, so meeting
the usual stream of night traffic towards Meerut. He passed two or
three strings of large, looming, half-seen wains without drawing
bridle, then pulled up almost involuntarily to a trot at the curiously
even tread of a drove of iron-shod oxen, and a low chanted song from
behind it. Bunjâra folk! The rough voice, the familiar rhythm
of the hoofs, reminded him of many a pleasant night-march in their
company.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301189" n="159 THE YELLOW FAKEER"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301190">'A good journey, brothers!' he called in the dialect. The answer
came unerringly, dark though it was.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301191">'The Lord keep the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> safe!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301192">It made him smile as he remembered that, of course, a lone man
trotting a horse along a highroad at night was bound to be alien, in a
country where horses are ambled and travellers go in twos and
threes. So the rough, broad faces would be smiling over the surprise
of a <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> knowing the Bunjâra talk; unless,
indeed, it happened to be--The possibility of its being the <hi rend="italic">tanda</hi> he knew had not occurred to him before. He
pulled up and looked round. A breathless shadow was at his stirrup,
and he fancied he saw a shadow or two further behind.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301193">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> has mistaken the road,' came
Tiddu's familiar creak. 'Meerut lies to the north.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301194">Breathless as he was, there was the pompous mystery in his voice
which always prefaced an attempt to extort money; and Jim Douglas,
having no further use for the old scoundrel, did not intend to give
him any, so he simulated an utter lack of surprise.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301195">'Hullo, Tiddu!' he said. 'I had an idea it might be you. So you
recognised my voice?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301196">The old man laughed. 'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> is mighty
clever. He knows old Tiddu has eyes. They saw the<hi rend="italic">
Huzoor's</hi> horse--a bay Wazeeri with a white star none too small,
and all the luck-marks--waiting at the fifteenth milestone, by
Begum-a-bad. But the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, being so clever,
is not going to ride the Wazeeri to-night. He is going to ride the
Belooch he is on, back to Meerut, though the star on her forehead is
too small for safety; my thumb could cover it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301197">'It's a bit too late to teach me the luck-marks, Tiddu,' said Jim
Douglas coolly. 'You want money, you ruffian; so I suppose you have
something to sell. What is it? If it is worth anything, you can trust
me to pay, surely.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301198">Tiddu looked round furtively. The other shadow, Jhungi or Bhungi,
or both, perhaps--the memory made Jim Douglas smile--had melted away
into the darkness. He and Tiddu were alone. The old man, even so,
reached up to whisper.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301199">''Tis the yellow fakeer, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! He  has
come.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301200">'The yellow fakeer!' echoed his hearer; 'who the devil is he? And
why shouldn't he come, if he likes?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301202">Tiddu paused, as if in sheer amaze, for a second. 'The<pb xml:id="fswater_1301201" n="160 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>
has not heard of the yellow fakeer? The dumb fakeer who brings the
speech that brings more than speech? <hi rend="italic">Wâh!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301203">'Speech that is more than speech,' echoed Jim Douglas angrily, then
paused in his turn; the phrase reminded him, vaguely, of his past
thoughts.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301204">Tiddu's hand went out to the Belooch's rein; his voice lost its
creak and took a soft sing-song to which the mare seemed to come round
of her own accord.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301205">'Yea! Speech that is more than speech, though he is dumb. Whence he
comes none know, not even I, the Many-faced. But I can see him when he
comes, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! the others, not unless he wills
to be seen. I saw him to-night. He passed me on a white horse not
half-an-hour agone, going Meerutwards. Did not the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> see him? That is because he has learnt from
old Tiddu to make others see, but not to see himself. But the old man
will teach him this also if he is in Meerut by dawn. If he is there by
dawn he will see the yellow fakeer who brings the speech that brings
more than speech.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301206">The sing-song ceased; the Beloochi was stepping briskly back
towards Meerut.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301207">'You infernal old humbug!' began Jim Douglas.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301208">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> does not believe, of course,'
remarked Tiddu, in the most matter-of-fact creak. 'But Meerut is only
eight miles off. His other horse can wait; and if he does not see the
yellow fakeer there is no need to open the purse-strings.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301209">The Englishman looked at his half-seen companion admiringly. He was
the most consummate scoundrel! His blending of mystery and purely
commercial commonplace was perfect--almost irresistible. There was no
reason why he should go on; the groom, half-way, had his usual orders
to stay till his master came. For the rest, it would be pleasant to
renew the old pleasant memory--pleasant even to renew his acquaintance
with Tiddu's guile, which struck him afresh each time he came across
it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301210">He slipped from his horse without a word, and was about to pull the
reins over her head so as to lead her, when Tiddu stopped short.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301212">'Jhungi will take her to the rest-house, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, or Bhungi. It will be safer so. I have a
clean cotton quilt in the bundle,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301211" n="161 THE YELLOW FAKEER"/>
and the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> can have my shoes and rub his
legs in the dust. That will do till dawn.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301213">He gave a jackal's cry, which was echoed from the darkness.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301214">'Leave her so, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! She is safe,' said
Tiddu; and Jim Douglas, as he obeyed, heard the mare whinny softly, as
if to a foal, as a shadow came out of the bushes. Jhungi or Bhungi, no
doubt.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301215">Five minutes after, with a certain unaccountable pleasure, be found
himself walking beside a laden bullock, one arm resting on its broad
pack, his feet keeping step with the remittent clang of its bell. It
was a strange dreamy companionship, as he knew of old; and once more
the stars seemed, after a time, to twinkle in unison with the bell, he
seemed to forget thought, to forget everything save the peaceful
stillness around, and his own unresting peace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301216">So he and the laden beast went on as one living, breathing mortal,
till the little shiver of wind came, which comes with the first paling
of the sky. It was one of those yellow dawns, serene, cloudless, save
for a puff or two of thin grey vapour low down on the horizon, looking
as if it were smoke from an unseen censer swinging before the chariot
of the Sun which heads the procession of the hours. He was so absorbed
in watching the yellow light grow to those clouds no bigger than a
man's hand, so lost in the strange companionship with the laden beast
bound to the wheel of Life and Death as he was yet asking no question
of the future, that Tiddu's hand and voice startled him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301217">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor!</hi>' he said. 'The yellow fakeer!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301218">They were close on the city of Meerut. The road, dipping down to
cross a depression, left a bank of yellow dust on either side. And on
the eastern one, outlined against the yellow sunrise, sat a motionless
figure. It was naked, and painted from head to foot a bright yellow
colour. The closed eyes were daubed over so as to hide them utterly,
and on the forehead, as it is in the image of Shiva, was painted
perpendicularly a gigantic eye, wide set, stony. Before it in the dust
lay the beggar's bowl for alms.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301219">'The roads part here, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>,' said
Tiddu. 'This to the city; that to the cantonments.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301221">As he spoke, a handsome young fellow came swaggering down the
latter, on his way evidently to riotous living in the<pb xml:id="fswater_1301220" n="162 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> bazaar. Suddenly he paused, his hand went
up to his eyes as if the rising sun were in them. Then he stepped
across the road and dropped a coin into the beggar's bowl. Tiddu
nodded his head gravely.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301222">'That man is wanted, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. That is why he
saw. Mayhap he is to give the word.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301223">'The word?' echoed Jim Douglas. 'You said he was dumb?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301224">'I meant the trooper, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. The fakeer
wanted him. To give the word, mayhap. Some one must always give
it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301225">Jim Douglas felt an odd thrill. He had never thought of that
before. Some one, of course, must always give the word, the speech
which brought more than speech. What would it be? Something
soul-stirring, no doubt; for Humanity had a theory that an angel must
trouble the waters and so give it a righteous cause for stepping in to
heal the evil.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301226">But what a strange knack the old man had of stirring the
imagination with ridiculous mystery! He felt vexed with himself for
his own thrill, his own thoughts. 'He is a very ordinary <hi rend="italic">yogi</hi>, I should say,' he remarked, looking towards
the yellow sunrise; but the figure was gone. He turned to Tiddu again,
with real annoyance. 'Well! Whoever he is, he cannot want me. And I
certainly saw him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301227">'I Willed the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> to see!' replied Tiddu
with calm effrontery.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301228">Jim Douglas laughed. The man was certainly a consummate liar; there
was never any possibility of catching him out.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0207" n="7" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VII<lb/>THE WORD WENT FORTH</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301230">THE Procession of the Hours had a weary march of it between the
yellow sunrise and the yellow sunset of the 10th of May 1857; for the
heavens were as brass, the air one flame of white heat. The mud huts
of the sepoy lines at Meerut looked and felt like bricks baking in a
kiln; yet the torpor which the remorseless glare of noon brings even
to native humanity was exchanged for a strange restlessness. The doors
stood open for the most part, and men wandered<pb xml:id="fswater_1301229" n="163 THE WORD WENT FORTH"/> in and out aimlessly, like swarming bees before the
queen appears. In the bazaar, in the city too, crowds drifted hither
and thither, thirstily, as if it were not the fast month of
Rumzân when the Mohammedans are denied the solace of even a
drop of water till sundown. Drifted hither and thither, pausing to
gather closer at a hint of novelty, melting away again, restless as
ever.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301231">Mayhap it was but the inevitable reaction after the stun and
stupefaction of Saturday, the sudden awakening to the result--namely,
that eighty-five of the best, smartest soldiers in Meerut had been set
to toil for ten years in shackles because they refused to be
defiled--to become apostate. On the other hand, the, old Baharupa may
have been right about the yellow fakeer; the silent, motionless figure
might have set folk listening and waiting for the word. It was to be
seen by all now sitting outside the city; at least Jim Douglas saw it
several times. Saw, also, that the beggar's bowl was fuller and
fuller; but the impossibility of asserting that all the passers by saw
it, as he did, haunted him, once the idea presented itself to his
mind. It was always so with Tiddu's mysteries; they were no more
susceptible to disproof than they were to proof. You could waste time,
of course, in this case by waiting and watching, but in the natural
course of events half the passers-by would go on as if they saw
nothing, and only one in a hundred or so would give an alms. So what
would be the good?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301232">No one else, however, among the masters troubled themselves to find
a cause for the restlessness; no one even knew of it. To begin with,
it was a Sunday, so that even the bond of a common labour was
slackened between the dark faces and the light. Then a mile or more of
waste deserted land and dry watercourse lay on either side of the
broad white road which split the cantonment into halves. So that the
North knew nothing of what was going on in the South, and while men
were swarming like bees in the sun on one side, on the other they were
shut up in barracks and bungalows gasping with the heat, longing for
the sun to set, and thanking their stars when the chaplain's <hi rend="italic">memo</hi> came
round to say that the evening service had been postponed for
half-an-hour to allow the seething, glowing air to cool a little.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301234">It was not the heat, however, which prevented Major<pb xml:id="fswater_1301233" n="164 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Erlton from taking his usual <hi rend="italic">siesta</hi>. It was thought. He had come over from Delhi
on inspection duty a few days before and had intended returning that
evening; but the morning's post had brought him a letter which upset
all his plans. Alice Gissing's husband had cone out a fortnight
earlier than they had expected, and was already on his way up
country. The crisis had come, the decision must be made. It was not
any hesitation, however, which sent the heavy handsome face to the big
strong hands as he rested his elbows on a sheet of blank paper. He had
made up his mind on the very day when Alice Gissing had first told him
why she could not go back to her husband. The letter forwarding his
papers for resignation was already sealed on the table beside him; and
the surprise was rather a gain than otherwise. Alice could join him at
Meerut now, and they could slip away together to Kashmir or any out of
the way place where there was shooting. That would save a lot of fuss;
and the fear of fuss was the only one which troubled the Major,
personally. He hated to know that even his friends would wonder--for
the matter of that those who knew him best would wonder most--why he
was chucking everything for a woman he had been mixed up with for
years? Yet he had found no difficulty in writing that official
request; none in telling little Allie to join him as soon as she
could. It was this third letter which could not be written. He took up
the pen more than once, only to lay it down again. He began, 'My dear
Kate,' once, only to tear the sheet to pieces. How could he call her
his when he was going to tell her that she was his no longer--that the
best thing she could do was to divorce him and marry some other chap
to be a father to the boy?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301235">The thought sent the head into the hands again; for Herbert Erlton
was a healthy animal and loved his offspring by instinct. He had in
truth, a queer upside-down notion of his responsibilities towards
them. If the fates had permitted it he would have done his best by
Freddy; shown him the ropes, given him useful tips, stood by his
inexperience, paid his reasonable debts--always supposing he had the
wherewithal.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301237">Then how was he to tell Kate all the ugly story. He had left her in
his thoughts so completely, she had been so far apart from him for so
many years now, that he hesitated over<pb xml:id="fswater_1301236" n="165 THE WORD WENT FORTH"/> telling her the bare facts, just as--being conventionally a
perfectly well-bred man--he would have hesitated how to tell them to
any innocent woman of his acquaintance, Rather more so: for
Kate--though she was sentimental enough, he told himself, for two had
never been sensible and looked things in the face. If she had, it
might all have been different. Then with a rush came the remembrance
that Allie did--that she knew him every inch and was yet willing to
come with him. While he? He would stick through thick and thin to
little Allie who never made a man feel a fool or a beast. Something in
the last assertion seemed to harden his heart; he took up his pen and
began to write:--</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="fswater_1301241"><body xml:id="fswater_1301240"><div xml:id="fswater_0901" type="letter"><opener><salute>'MY DEAR

uncomfortable remembrance that it was the last letter he<pb xml:id="fswater_1301242" n="166 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> meant to write to her. Then he
threw it ready for the post beside the others, and lay down feeling
that he had done his duty. And as he dozed off his own simile haunted
him. From start to finish! How few men rode straight all the way; and
the poor beggars who came to grief over the last fence weren't so far
behind those who came in for the clapping. It was the finish that did
it; that was the win or the lose. But he would run straight with
little Allie--straight as a die! So he lost consciousness in a glow of
virtuous content with the future, and joined the whole of the northern
half of Meerut in their noontide slumbers; for the future outlook, if
not exactly satisfying, was not sufficiently dubious to keep it
awake.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301244">But in the southern half, humanity was still swarming in and out,
waiting, listening. In one of the mud-huts, however, a company of men
gathered within closed doors had been listening to some purpose;
listening to an eloquent speaker, the accredited agent of a
down-country organisation. He had arrived in Meerut a day or two
before, and had held one meeting after another in the lines, doing his
utmost to prevent any premature action; for the fiat of the leaders
was that there should be patience till the 31st of May. Then, not
until then, a combined blow for India, for God, for themselves, might
be struck with chance of success.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301245">'Ameen!' assented one old man who had come with him--an old man in
a huge faded green turban with dyed red hair and beard, and with a
huge green waistband holding a curved scimitar--briefly, a <hi rend="italic">Ghazee</hi> or Mohammedan fanatic, Patience all ye
faithful till Sunday, the 31st of May. Then, while the hell-doomed
infidels are at their evening prayer, defenceless, fall on them and
slay. God will show the right! This is the Moulvie's word, sent by me
his servant. Give the Great Cry, brothers, in the House of the Thief!
Smite, ye of Meerut! and we of Lucknow will smite also!' His wild
uncontrolled voice rolled on in broad Arabic vowels from one text to
another.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301246">'And we of Delhi will smite also,' interrupted the wearer of a
rakish Moghul cap impatiently. 'We will smite for the Queen.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301247">'The Queen?' echoed an older man in the same dress. 'What hath the
Sheeah woman to do with the race of Timoor?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301248" n="167 THE WORD WENT FORTH"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301249">'Peace! peace! brothers,' put in the agent with authority. 'These
times are not for petty squabbles. Let who be the heir, the King must
reign.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301250">A murmur of assent rose; but it was broken in upon by a dissentient
voice from a group of troopers at the door.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301251">'Then our comrades are to rot in jail till the 31st? That suits not
the men of the 3rd Cavalry.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301252">'Then let the 3rd Cavalry suit itself,' retorted the agent
fearlessly. 'We can stand without them. Can they stand without us?
Answer me, men of the 20th; men of the 11th.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301253">'There be not many of us here,' muttered a voice from a dark corner
'and maybe we could hold our own against the lot of you.' It was
Soma's, and the man beside him frowned. But the agent who knew every
petty jealousy, every private quarrel of regiment with regiment, went
on remorselessly. 'Let the 3rd swagger if it choose. The Rajpoots and
Brahmins know how to obey the stars. The 31st is the auspicious
day. That is the word. The word of the king, of the Brahmins, of
India, of God!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301254">'The 31st! Then slay and spare not! It is <hi rend="italic">jehad!
Deen! Deen Futteh-Mahommed</hi>,' said the <hi rend="italic">Ghazee</hi>.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301255">The cry, though a mere whisper, electrified the Mohammedans, and an
older man in the group of dissentients at the door muttered that he
could hold his troop, if others--who had risen to favour quicker than
he--could hold theirs.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301256">'I'll hold mine, Khân <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, without
thine aid,' retorted a very young smart-looking native officer
angrily. 'That is if the women will hold their tougues. But, look you,
my troop held the hardest hitters in the 3rd. And Nargeeza's fancy is
of those in jail. Now Nargeeza leads all the other townwomen by the
nose; and that means much to men who be not all saints like <hi rend="italic">Ghazee-jee</hi> yonder, who ties the two ends of life
with a ragged green turban and a bloody banner!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301257">'And I see not why our comrades should stay yonder for three weeks,
when there is but a native guard to hold them, and I and mine have
made the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi> what it is,' put in a man with
arrogance and insolence written on him from top to toe; a true type of
the pampered Brahmin sepoy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301258">'Rescue them if thou wilt <hi rend="italic">Havildar-jee</hi>,'
sneered the agent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301260">'But the man who risks our plot will be held traitor by the
Council. And the men of the 11th,' he added sharply, turn<pb xml:id="fswater_1301259" n="168 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>ing to the corner whence Soma's
voice had come, 'may remember that also. They have had the audacity to
stipulate for their Colonel's life.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301261">'For our officers lives, <hi rend="italic">baboo-jee</hi>,' came
the voice again, bold as the agents. 'We of the 11th kill not men who
have led us to victory. And if this be not understood I, Soma,
Yadubansi, go straight to the Colonel and tell him. We are not
butchers in the 11th, Oh! priest of Kâli!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301262">The agent turned a little pale. He did not care to have his calling
known, and he saw at a glance that his challenger had the reckless
fire of hemp in his eyes. He had indeed been drinking as a refuge from
the memory of the sweeper's broom and from the taunts and threats
which had been used to force him to join the malcontents. Such a man
was not safe to quarrel with, nor was the audience fit for a
discussion of that topic; there was already a stir in it, and
mutterings that butchery was one thing, fighting another.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301263">'Pay thy Colonel's journey home if thou likest, Rajpoot-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>,' he said with a sneer. 'Ay! and give him
pension, too! All we want is to get rid of them. And there will be
plenty of loot left when the pension is paid, for it is to be each man
for himself when the time comes. Not share and share alike with every
coward who will not risk his life in looting, as it is with the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301264">It was a deft red-herring to these born mercenaries and no more was
said. But as the meeting dispersed by twos and threes to avoid notice,
the agent stood at the door giving the word in a final whisper.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301265">'Patience till the 31st.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301266">'Willst take a seat in our carriage, <hi rend="italic">Ghazee-jee</hi>,' said a fat native officer as he passed
out. ''Tis at thy service since thou goest to Delhi and we must return
to-night. God knows we have done enough to damn us at Meerut over this
court-martial! But what would you? If we had not given the verdict for
the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> there would have been more of us in
jail. So we bide our time like the rest. And to-morrow there is the
parade to hear the sentence on the martyrs at Barrackpore. Do the <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> think us cowards that they drive us so?--God
smite their souls to hell!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301268">'He will, brother, he will. The cry shall yet be heard in the House
of the Thief,' said the <hi rend="italic">Ghazee</hi> fiercely, his
eyes growing dreamy with hope. He was thinking of a sunset<pb xml:id="fswater_1301267" n="169 THE WORD WENT FORTH"/> near the Goomtee more than a year
ago, when he had bid every penny he possessed for his own, in
vain.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301269">'Well, come if thou likest,' continued the native officer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301270">'That camel of thine yonder is lame, and we have room. 'Twas Erlton
<hi rend="italic">sahib's dâk</hi> by rights but he goes not;
so we got it cheap instead of an <hi rend="italic">ekka</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301271">'Erlton <hi rend="italic">sahib's</hi>!' echoed the fanatic,
clutching at his sword. 'Ay! Ay!' he went on half to himself. 'I knew
he was at Delhi, and the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> who laughed, and
the other <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> who would not listen. Nay!
Soubadar-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>! I travel in no carriage of Erlton
<hi rend="italic">sahib's</hi>. My camel will serve me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301272">''Tis the vehicle of saints,' sneered the owner of the rakish
Moghul cap. 'Verily when I saw thee mounted on it, <hi rend="italic">Ghazee-jee</hi>, I deemed thee the Lord Ali.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301273">'Peace! scoffer,' interrupted the fanatic, 'lest I mistake thee for
an infidel.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301274">The Moghul ducked hastily from a wild swing of the curved sword,
and moved off swearing such firebrands should be locked up; they might
set light to the train ere wise men had it ready.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301275">'No fear!' said the smart young troop-sergeant of the 3rd. 'Who
listens to such as he save those whose blood has cooled, and those
whose blood was never hot? The fighters listen to women who can make
theirs flame.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301276">Soma, who was drifting with them towards the drug-shops of the
city, scowled fiercely. 'That may suit thee, Mussulman-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi> who art casteless, and can sup shares with
sweeper women in the bazaar; but the Rajpoot needs no harlot to teach
him courage. The mothers of his race have enough and to spare.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301277">'<hi rend="italic">Loh!</hi> hark to him!' jibed the corporal of
the 20th, who was sticking to his prey like a leech.' Ask him, <hi rend="italic">Havildar-jee</hi>, if he prefers a sweeper's broom to a
sweeper's lips.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301278">There was a roar of laughter from the group.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301280">Soma gave a beast-like cry, looked as though he were about to
spring, then recognising his own helplessness--flung himself away from
all companionship and walked home moodily. They had driven him too
far; he would not stand it. If that tale was spread abroad, he would
side with the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> who did not believe such
things--with the Colonel who understood, like the Colonel before him
who had gone home on pension; for the 11th had a cult of their
officers. And<pb xml:id="fswater_1301279" n="170 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> these fools,
his countrymen, thought to make him a butcher by threats; sought to
make him take revenge for what deserved revenge. For it was the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar's</hi> fault--it was the <hi rend="italic">Sirkar's</hi> fault.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301281">In truth a strange conflict was going on in this man's mind, as it
was in many another such as his, between inherited traditions, making
alike for loyalty and disloyalty. There was the knowledge of his
forbear's pride in their victories, in their <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> who had led them to victory, and the
knowledge of their pride in the veriest jot or tittle of ceremonial
law. A dull painful amaze filled him that these two broad facts should
be in conflict; that those, whom in a way he felt to be part of his
life, should be in league against him. All the more reason, that, for
showing them who were the better men--for standing up fairly to a fair
fight. By all the delights of Swarga! he would like to stand up fair,
even to the master--the man who, in his presence, had shot three
tigers on foot in half-an-hour--the demi-god of his hunting yarns for
years--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301282">And then, suddenly, he remembered that this hero of his might be
shot like a dog on the 31st at Delhi--would be shot, since he was
certain to be in the front of anything. Soma's heat-fevered,
hemp-drugged brain seized on the thought fiercely, confusedly. That
must not be! The master, at any rate, must be warned. He would go down
when the sun set, and see if he were still where he had been the day
before; and if not?--Why! then it must be two days leave to Delhi! He
was not going to butcher the master for all the sweeper's brooms in
the world. Fools! those others, to think to drive him, Soma,
Chundrabansi! So he flung himself on his string bed to sleep till the
sunset came, and the tyranny of heat be overpast.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301284">But there was one, close by in the cantonment bazaar, who waited
for sunset with no desire for it to bring coolness. She meant it to
bring heat instead. And this was Nargeeza the courtesan. She was past
the prime of everything save vice, a woman who, once all-powerful,
could not hope for many more lovers; and hers, a man rich beyond most
soldiers, lay in jail for ten years. No wonder, then, that as she lay
half-torpid among a heap of tawdry finery in the biggest house of the
lane set apart by regulation for such as she, there was all the venom
of a snake in her drowsy brain. The air of<pb xml:id="fswater_1301283" n="171 THE WORD WENT FORTH"/> the low room was deadly with a scent of musk and roses and
orange-blossom-oil. The half-dozen girls and women who lounged in it,
or in the balcony, were half undressed, their bare brown arms flung
carelessly upon dirty mats and torn quilts. Their harvest time was not
yet; that would come later when sunsetting brought the men from the
lines. This then was the time for sleep. But Nargeeza, recognised head
of the recognised regimental women, sat up suddenly and said
sharply--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301285">'Thou didst not tell me, Nasiban, what Gulabi said. Is she of
us?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301286">A drowsy lump of a girl stirred, yawned, and answered sullenly,
'Yea! Yea! she is of us. She claims our right to kiss no cowards--no
cowards.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301287">The voice tailed off into sleep again, and Nargeeza lay back with a
smile of content to wait also. So, after a time, folk began to stir in
the bungalows. First in the rest-house, where, oddly enough, Jim
Douglas occupied one end of the long low barrack of a place, and
Herbert Erlton the other. The former having come back from the city in
an evil temper to get something to eat before starting for Delhi, had
found his horse, the Belooch, unaccountably indisposed; Jhungi, who
had brought her there safely, professing entire ignorance of the
cause, or, on pressure, suggesting the nefarious Bhungi. Tiddu
asserting--with a calm assumption of superior knowledge, for which Jim
Douglas could have kicked him--that the mare had been drugged. As if
anybody could not tell that?--and that the drug had been opium. To
which the old scoundrel had replied affably that in that case the
effects would pass off during the night, and the mare be none the
worse; no one be any the worse, since the Huzoor was quite comfortable
in Meerut, and <hi rend="italic">could easily stay another
day</hi>. It was a nicer place than Delhi; there were more <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> in it, and the presence of the '<hi rend="italic">ghora logue</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> English
soldiers), kept every one virtuous.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301289">His hearer looked at him sharply. Here was some other trick, no
doubt, to cozen him out of another five rupees; for something, may be,
as useless as the yellow fakeer. And there was really no reason for
delay; it was only a case of walking the mare quietly. For the matter
of that, the exercise would do her good, and help her to work off the
effects of the drug. So he would start sooner, that was all.<pb xml:id="fswater_1301288" n="172 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Nevertheless he gave an
envious look at the Major's little Arab in the next stall. If would
most likely be marching back to Delhi that night, and he would have
given something to ride it again. But as he was returning from the
stables, he learnt by chance that the Major's plans had been
altered. An orderly was coming from his room with letters and a
telegram, and knowing the man, Jim Douglas asked him to take one for
him also, and so save trouble. It did not take long to write, for it
only contained one word, 'No.' It was in reply to one he had received
a few hours before from the military magnate, asking him to do some
more work. And as the orderly stowed away the accompanying rupee
carefully, Jim Douglas--waiting to make over the paper--saw quite
involuntarily that the Major's telegram also consisted of one word,
'Come.' And he saw the name also; big, black, bold, in the Major's
handwriting. 'Gissing, Delhi.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301290">He gave a shrug of his shoulders as he turned away to get ready for
his start. So that was it; and even Kate Erlton had not benefited by
his sacrifice. No one had benefited. There had been no chance for any
of them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301291">'Come!' That ended Kate Erlton's hope of concealment, and the
Major's career. 'No!' That ended his own vague ambitions. Still, it
was a strange chance in itself that those two laconic renunciations
should go the same day by the same band. No stranger telegrams, he
thought, could have left Meerut, or were likely to leave it that
night.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301292">He was wrong, however. An hour or two later, the strangest telegram
that ever came as sole warning to an Empire that its very foundation
was attacked, left Meerut for Agra sent by the postmaster's niece.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301293"><hi rend="italic">The Cavalry,</hi>' it ran, '<hi rend="italic">have risen, setting fire to their own houses besides
having killed and wounded all European officers and soldiers they
could find near the lines. If Aunt intends starting to-morrow, please
detain her, as the van has been prevented from leaving the
station.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301295">For, as Jim Douglas paced slowly down the Mall towards Delhi, and
Soma, his buckles gleaming, his belts pipe-clayed to dazzling
whiteness, was swaggering through the bazaar on his way to the
rest-house with his word of warning, another word--the word which
would have given Jim Douglas the power for which he had longed--was
being spoken in that lane of lust, where the time had come for
which<pb xml:id="fswater_1301294" n="173 THE WORD WENT FORTH"/> Nargeeza had waited all
day. But she did not say it. It was only a big trollop of a girl hung
with jasmin garlands, painted, giggling.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301296">'We of the bazaar kiss no cowards,' she said derisively. 'Where are
your comrades?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301297">The man to whom she said it, a young dissolute-faced trooper,
dressed in the loose rakish muslins beloved of his class--the very
man, perchance, who had gone citywards that morning, and dropped an
alms into the yellow fakeer's bowl--stood for a second in the stifling
maddening atmosphere of musk and rose and orange-blossom; stood before
all those insolent allurements, baulked in his passion, checked in his
desires. Then, with an oath, he dashed from her insulting charms;
dashed into the street with a cry--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301298">'To horse! To horse, brothers! To the jail! to our comrades!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301299">The word had been spoken. The speech which brings more than speech,
had come from the painted lips of a harlot.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301300">The first clang of the church bell--which the chaplain had
forgotten to postpone--came faintly audible across the dusty plain,
making other men pause and look at each other. Why not? It was the
hour of prayer--the appointed time. Their comrades could be easily
rescued--there was but a native guard at the jail. And hark! from
another pair of painted derisive lips came the same retort, flung from
a balcony.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301301">'<hi rend="italic">Trra! We of the bazaar kiss no
cowards!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301302">'To horse! To horse! Let the comrades be rescued first; and
then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301303">The word had been spoken. Nothing so very soul-stirring after
all. No consideration of caste or religion, patriotism or
ambition. Only a taunt from a pair of painted lips.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1301304" n="[174]"/><div xml:id="fswater_0300" n="3" type="book"><head>BOOK III <lb/><hi rend="italic">FROM DUSK TO DAWN</hi></head><div xml:id="fswater_0301" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I<lb/>NIGHT</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301305">'To the rescue! To the rescue!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301306">The cry was no more than that at first. To the rescue of the
eighty-five martyrs, the blows upon whose shackles still seemed to
echo in their comrade's ears. Even so, the cry heard by Soma as he
passed through the bazaar meant insubordination--the greatest crime he
knew--and sent him flying to his own lines to give the alarm. Sent him
thence by instinct, oblivious of that promise for the 31st--or perhaps
mindful of it and seeing in this outburst a mere riot--to his
Colonel's house with twenty or thirty comrades clamouring for their
arms, protesting that with them they would soon settle matters for the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi>. But suspicion was in the air, and even
the Colonel of the 11th could not trust all his regiment. Ready for
church, he flung himself on his horse and raced back with the
clamouring men to the lines.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301307">And by this time there was another race going on. Captain Craigie's
faithful troop of the 3rd Cavalry were racing after his shout of '<hi rend="italic">Dau-ro! bhai-yan Dau-ro!</hi>' (Ride, brothers, ride!)
towards the jail in the hopes of averting the rescue of their
comrades. For, as the records are careful to say, he and his troop
'were dressed as for parade'--not a buckle or a belt awry--ready to
combat the danger before others had grasped it, and swiftly without a
thought, went for the first offenders. Too late! the doors were open,
the birds flown.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301309">What next was to be done? What but to bring the troop<pb xml:id="fswater_1301308" n="175 NIGHT"/> back without a defaulter--despite the taunts of
escaping convicts, the temptations of comrades flushed by success--to
the parade ground for orders. But there was no one to give them, for
when the 3rd Cavalry led the van of mutiny at Meerut their Colonel was
in the European cantonment as field officer of the week, and there he
'conceived it his duty to remain.' Perhaps rightly. And it is also
conceivable that his absence made no difference since it is, palpably,
an easier task to make a regiment mutiny than to bring it back to its
allegiance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301310">Meanwhile the officers of the other regiments, the 11th and the
20th, were facing their men boldly; facing the problem how to keep
them steady till that squadron of the Carabineers should sweep down
followed by a company or two of the Rifles at the double, and turn the
balance in favour of loyalty. It could not be long now. Nearly an hour
had passed since the first wild stampede to the jail. The refuse and
rabble of the town were by this time swarming out of it, armed with
sticks and staves; the two thousand and odd felons released from the
jails were swarming in, seeking weapons. The danger grew every second,
and the officers of the 11th, though their men stood steady as rocks
behind them counted the moments as they sped. For on the other side of
the road, on the parade ground of the 20th regiment, the sepoys,
ordered, as the 11th had been, to turn out unarmed, were barely
restrained from rushing the bells by the entreaties of their native
officers; the European ones being powerless.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301311">'Keep the men steady for me,' said Colonel Finnis to his second in
command; 'I'll go over and see what I can do.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301312">He thought the voice of a man loved and trusted by one regiment, a
man who could speak to his sepoys without an interpreter, might have
power to steady another.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301313">'<hi rend="italic">Jai bahâduri!</hi>' (Victory to courage!)
muttered Soma under his breath as he watched his Colonel canter
quietly into danger. And his finger hungered on that hot May evening
for the cool of the trigger which was denied him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301315"><hi rend="italic">'Jai bahâduri!</hi> ' A murmur seemed to run through the
ranks, they dressed themselves firmer, squarer. Colonel Finnis
glancing back saw a sight to gladden any commandant's heart. A
regiment steady as a rock, drawn up as for parade, absolutely in hand,
despite that strange new<pb xml:id="fswater_1301314" n="176 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
sound in the air. The sound which above all others gets into men's
brains like new wine. The sound of a file upon fetters--the sound of
escape, of freedom, of licence! It had been rising unchecked for
half-an-hour from the lines of the 3rd whither the martyrs had been
brought in triumph. It was rising now from the bazaar, the city, from
every quiet corner where a prisoner might pause to hack and hammer at
his leg-irons with the first tool he could find.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301316">What was one man's voice against this sound, strengthened as it was
by the cry of a trooper galloping madly from the north shouting that
the English were in sight? What more likely? Had not ample time passed
for the whole British garrison to be coming with fixed bayonets and a
whoop, to make short work of unarmed men who had not made up their
minds?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301317">That must be no longer!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301318">'Quick! brothers. Quick! Kill! Kill! Down with the officers! Shoot
ere the white faces come!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301319">It was a sudden wild yell of terror, of courage, of sheer
cruelty. It drowned the scream of the Colonel's horse as it staggered
under him. It drowned his steady appealing voice, his faint sob, as he
threw up his hands at the next shot, and fell, the first victim to the
Great Revolt.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301320">It drowned something else also. It drowned Soma's groan of wild,
half-stupefied, helpless rage as he saw his colonel fall,--the <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> who had led him to victory--the <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> whom he loved, whom he was pledged to
save. And his groan was echoed by many another brave man in those
ranks, thus brought face to face suddenly with the necessity for
decision.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301321">'Steady, men, steady!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301322">That call, in the alien voice, echoed above the whistling of the
bullets as they found a billet here and there among the ranks; for the
men of the 20th, maddened by that fresh murder, now shot wildly at
their officers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301323">'Steady, men! Steady, for God's sake!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301324">The entreaty was not in vain; they were steady still. Ay, steady,
but unarmed! Steady as a rock still, but helpless!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301325">Helpless, unarmed! By all the gods all men worshipped, men could
not suffer that for long, when bullets were whistling into their
ranks!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301327">So there was a waver at last in the long line. A faint<pb xml:id="fswater_1301326" n="177 NIGHT"/> tremble, like the tremble of a curving wave ere it
falls. Then, with a confused roar, an aimless sweeping away of all
things in its path, it broke as a wave breaks upon a pebbly shore.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301328">'To arms, brothers! Quick! fire! fire!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301329">Upon whom?<ref target="#fswatern177">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern177" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">This question is one which must be asked
as we look back through the years on this pitiful spectacle of the
loyal regiment unarmed, facing the disloyal one shooting down its
officers. Briefly, on whom would the seventy men of the 11th, who
never left the colours, the hundred and twenty men who returned to
them after the short night of tumult was over, have fired if a company
of English troops had come up to turn the balance in favour of
loyalty?</note> God knows! Not on their officers, for these were
already being hustled to the rear, hustled into safety.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301330">'Quick, brothers, quick, Kill, kill!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301331">The cry rose on all sides now, as the wave of revolt surged on. But
there was none left to kill; for the work was done in the 20th lines,
and no new white faces came to stem the tide; the two thousand and odd
Englishmen who might have stemmed it being still on the parade-ground
by the church, waiting for orders, for ammunition, for a General, for
everything save--thank Heaven!--for courage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301332">So the wave surged on, to what end it scarcely knew, leaving behind
it groups of sullen, startled faces.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301333">'Whose fault but their own?' muttered an old man fiercely, an old
man whose son served beside him in the regiment, whose grandson was on
the roster for future enlistment. 'Why were we left helpless as
new-born babes?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301334">'Why?' echoed a scornful voice from the gathering clusters of
undecided men, waiting, with growing fear, hope, despair or triumph,
for what was to come next: waiting, briefly, for the master to come,
or riot to come. 'Why? because they were afraid of us; because their
time is past, <hi rend="italic">baba jee</hi>. Let them go!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301335">Let them go! Incomprehensible suggestion to that brain worn stiff
in the master's service; so, with a great numb ache in an old heart,
an old body strode away, elbowing younger ones from its path
savagely.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301336">'Old Dhurma bath grown milksop,' jeered one spectator, 'that is
with doing dry-nurse to his captain's babies.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301338">The words caught the old man's ear and sent a quick<pb xml:id="fswater_1301337" n="178 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> decision to his dazed face. The <hi rend="italic">baba logue</hi>! Yes; they must be safeguarded; for
ominous smoke began to rise from neighbouring roof-trees, and a
strange note of sheer wildbeast ferocity grew to the confused roar of
the drifting, shifting, still aimless crowd.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301339">'Quick, brothers, quick! Kill, root and branch! Why dost linger?
Art afraid? Afraid of cowards? Quick--kill every one!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301340">The cry, boastful, jeering, came from a sepoy in the uniform of the
20th, who with a face ablaze with mad exultation forced his way
forward. There was something in his tone which seemed to send a shiver
of fresh excitement through his comrades, for they paused in their
strange tumult, paused and listened to the jeers, the reproaches.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301341">'What! art cowards too?' he went on. 'Then follow me. For I began
it--I fired the first shot--I killed the first infidel. I--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301342">The boast never ended, for above it came a quicker cry:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301343">'Kill, kill, kill the traitor! Kill the man who betrayed us.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301344">There was a rush inwards towards the boastful, arrogant voice, the
report of half-a-dozen muskets, and the crowd surged on to revolt over
the body of the man who had fired the first shot of the mutiny.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301345">For it was a strange crowd indeed. Most of it powerless for good or
ill, sheep without a shepherd, wandering after the rabble of escaped
convicts and the refuse of the bazaars as they plundered and fired the
houses; joining in the licence helplessly, drifting inevitably to
violence, so that some looked on curiously, unconcernedly, while
others, maddened by the smell of blood, the sounds of murder, dragged
helpless Englishmen and Englishwomen from their carriages and did them
to death savagely.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301346">But there were more like Soma, who, as the darkness deepened and
the glare and the dire confusion and dismay grew, stood aloof from it
voluntarily, waiting, with a certain callousness, to see if the master
would come, or if folk said true when they declared his time was past,
his day done.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301348">Where was he? He should have come hours ago, irresistible,
overwhelming. But there was no sign. Not a hint of resistance, save
every now and again a clatter of hoofs through the darkness, an alien
voice calling '<hi rend="italic">Mâro! Mâro!</hi>' to
those behind him, and a fierce howl of an echo, '<hi rend="italic">Mâro!<pb xml:id="fswater_1301347" n="179 NIGHT"/> Mâro! Mâ-roh!</hi>' from the
faithful troop. For Captain Craigie, finding none to help him, had
changed his cry; it was 'kill, kill, kill!' now. And the faithful
troop obeyed orders.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301349">Soma when he heard it gave a great sigh. If there had been more of
that sort of thing he would dearly have loved to be in it; but the
other was butchery. So he wandered alone, irresolute; drifting
northwards from the dire confusion and dismay, and crossing the Mall
to question a sentry of his own regiment as to what had happened to
the masters. But the man replied by eager questions as to what had
happened to the servants? And then they both agreed that if the Two
Thousand could not quell a riot it would be idle to help them, the
Lord's hand being so palpably against them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301350">Nevertheless, half an hour afterwards the sentry still waited at
his post, and the guard over the Treasury saluted as if nothing
unusual was afoot to a group of Englishmen galloping past.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301351">'Those men know nothing,' called Major Erlton to another man. 'It
can't be so bad. Surely something can be done!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301352">'Something should have been done two hours ago,' came a sharp
voice. 'However, the troops have started at last. If anv one--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301353">The remainder was lost in the clatter. But more than one man's
voice had been lost in those two hours at Meerut on the 10th of May
1857; indeed, everything seems to have been lost save--thank Heaven
once more!--personal courage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301354">It was now near eight o'clock, and Soma, skulking by the Mall
midway between the masters and the men, still irresolute, still
uncertain, heard the first cry of 'to Delhi! to Delhi!' which, as the
night wore on, was to echo so often along that road. The cry which
came unbidden as the astounding success of the revolt brought thoughts
of greater success in the future.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301355">The moon was now rising to silver the dense clouds of smoke which
hung above the pillars of flame, and give an additional horror of
light to the orgies going on unchecked. It showed him a group of 3rd
Cavalry troopers, galloping madly down the Mall. It showed them the
glitter of his buckles, making them shout again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301356">'To Delhi, brother, to Delhi!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301358">Not yet. He had not seen the upshot yet. He must go<pb xml:id="fswater_1301357" n="180 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> and see what was passing in the lines
first. So he struck rapidly across the open as the quickest way. And
then behind him, close upon him, came another clatter of hoofs, a very
different cry.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301359">'<hi rend="italic">Shâh bâsh! bhaiyân. Mâro!
Mâro!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301360">Remembering the glitter of his buckles, he turned and ran for the
nearest cover. None too soon, for a Mohammedan trooper was after him,
shouting '<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen!</hi> Death to the Hindoo
pig!'--for any cry comes handy when the blood is up and there is a
sabre in the hand. Soma had to double like a hare, and even so, when
he paused to get his breath in a tangle of lime-bushes there was a
graze on his cheek. He had judged his distance in one of those doubles
a hair's-breadth too little. The faint trickle of blood sent a spasm
of old inherited race hatred through him. The outcaste should know
that the Hindoo pig shot straight. The means of showing this were not
far to find in the track of the faithful troop. Five minutes after,
Soma, with a musket dragged from beneath something which lay huddled
up face down upon Mother Earth, was crouching in a belt of cover,
waiting for the troop to come flashing through the glare seeking more
work; for there had been yells and screams enough round that bungalow
to stop looting there. And as it came, number seven bent lower to his
saddle bow suddenly, then toppled over with a clang.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301361">'Left wheel! clear those bushes,' came the order sharply. But Soma
was too quick for that.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301362">'Close up. Forward!' came the order again, as Captain Craigie's
faithful troop went on, minus a man, and Soma, stumbling breathlessly
in safety knew that the die was cast. There was that answering quiver
in his veins which comes when like blood has been spilt. He knew his
foe now; he could go to Delhi now. And hark! That was a regular rattle
of musketry, at last--not the dropping fire of mere butchery--but a
regular volley. He gripped his musket tighter and listened. If the
battle had begun he must be in it. The air was full of cracklings and
hissings--an inarticulate background to murderous yells, terrified
screams, horrors without end; but no more volleys came to tell of
retribution.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301364">What did it mean? Soma held his breath hard. Hark! what was that? A
louder burst of that recurring cry, 'to Delhi! to Delhi!' as the last
stragglers of the 3rd Cavalry,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301363" n="181 NIGHT"/> escaping from
the lines at the long-delayed appearance there of law and order,
followed their comrades' example.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301365">So that the Two Thousand coming down in force found nothing but the
women and children; poor, frightened, terror-struck hostages, left
behind, inevitably, in the unforeseen success.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301366">But Soma, knowing nothing of this, waited--that grip on his musket
slackening--for the next volley. But none came. Only, suddenly a bugle
call.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301367"><hi rend="italic">The retreat!</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301368">Incredible! Impossible! Yes! Once, twice, thrice--<hi rend="italic">the retreat</hi>! The masters were not going to fight at
Meerut then, and he must try Delhi. So, turning swiftly, he cut into
the road behind the cry.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301369">'My God, Craigie! what's that? not the retreat, surely!' came a
boyish voice from the clatter and rattle of the faithful troop.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301370">'Don't know! Hurry up all you can, Clark! There's more of the
devils needing cold steel yonder, and I'd like to see to my wife's
safety as soon as I can. <hi rend="italic">Shâh bâsh
bhaiyân! Dân-ro! Mâro!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301371">'<hi rend="italic">Mâ-ro--Mâ-ro--Mâ-roh!</hi>'
echoed the howl. What was the retreat to them when their Captain's
voice called to them as brothers? It is idle to ask the question, but
one cannot help wondering if the Captain's pocket still held the
official wigging. For the sake of picturesque effect it is to be hoped
it did.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301373">Nevertheless it was the retreat. A council of officers had
suggested that, since the mutineers were not in their lines, they
might be looting European cantonments. So the Two Thousand returned
thither, after firing that one volley into a wood, and then--finding
all quiet to the north--proceeded to bivouac on the parade ground for
the night. Not a very peaceful spot, since it was within sight and
sound of blazing roof-trees, and plundering ruffians. The worst
horrors of that night, we are told, can never be known. Perhaps some
people beg to differ, holding that no horror can exceed the thought of
women and children hiding like hares on that southern side, creeping
for dear life from one friendly shadow to another, and finding help in
dark hands when white ones failed them, within reach of that
bivouac. But the faithful troop did good service; and many another
band of independent braves<pb xml:id="fswater_1301372" n="182 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
also. Captain Craigie, finding leisure at last, found also--it is a
relief to know--that some of his own men had sneaked away from duty to
secure his wife's safety when they saw their Captain would not. And if
anything can relieve the deadly depression which sinks upon the soul
at the thought of that horrible lack of emotion in the north, it is to
picture that very different scene on the south, when Captain Craigie,
seeing his only hope of getting the ladies safely escorted to the
European barrakcs lay in his troopers, brought the two Englishwomen
out to them and said simply, 'Here are the <hi rend="italic">mems</hi>! save them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301374">And then the two score or so of rough men, swash-bucklers by birth
and training, flung themselves from their horses, cast themselves at
those alien women's feet with tears and oaths. Oaths that were
kept.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301375">But, on the other side, people were more placid. One reads of
Englishmen watching 'their own sleeping children with gratitude in
their Hearts to God,' with wonderings as 'to the fate of their friends
in the south,' with anticipations of 'what would befall their
Christian brethren in Delhi on the coming morn, who, less happy than
ourselves, had no faithful and friendly European battalions to shield
them from the bloodthirsty rage of the sepoys.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301376">What, indeed? considering; that for two hours bands of armed men
had clattered and marched down that dividing road crying 'to Delhi, to
Delhi.' But no warning of the coming danger had been sent thither; the
confusion had been too great. And now, about midnight, the telegraph
wires had been cut. Yet Delhi lay but thirty miles off along a broad
white road, and there were horses galore and men ready to ride
them. Men ready for more than that, like Captain Rosser of the
Carabineers, who pleaded for a squadron, field battery, a troop, a
gun--anything with which to dash down the road and cut off that
retreat to Delhi. But everything was refused. Lieutenant Mohler of the
11th offered to ride and at least give warning; but that offer was
also set aside. And many another brave man, no doubt, bound to obey
orders, ate his heart out in inaction that night, possessing himself
in some measure of patience with the thought that the dawn <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see them on that Delhi road.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301378">But there was one man who owed obedience to none; who was free to
go if he chose. And he did choose. ten minutes<pb xml:id="fswater_1301377" n="183 NIGHT"/>
after it dawned upon Herbert Erlton that no warning had been given,
that no succour would be sent, he had changed horses for the game
little Arab which had once belonged to Jim Douglas, and was off, to
reach Delhi as best he could; for a woman slept in the very city
itself, exposed to the first assault of ruffianism, whom he must save,
if he could. So he set his teeth and rode straight. At first down the
road, for the last of the fugitives had had a good hour's start of
him, and he could count on four or five miles plain sailing. Then,
since his object was to head the procession, and he did not dare to
strike across country from his utter ignorance both of the way or how
to ask it, he must give the road a half-mile berth or so, and keeping
it as a guide, make his way somehow. There were bridges he knew where
he must hark back to the only path, but he must trust to luck for a
quiet interval.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301379">The plan proved more difficult than he expected. More than once he
found himself in danger from being too close to the disciplined tramp
which he began so overtake about six miles out, and twice he lost
himself from being too far away and mistaking one belt of trees for
another. Still there was plenty of time if the Arab held out with his
weight. The night was hot and stifling but if he took it coolly till
the road was pretty clear again he could forge ahead in no time; for
the Arab had the heels of every horse in Upper India. Major Erlton
knew this, and bent over to pat its neck with the pride of certainty
with which he had patted it before many a race which it had won for
him since it had lost one for Jim Douglas.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301380">So he saved it all he knew; but he rode fifteen stone--and that,
over jumps, must tell. There was no other way, however, that he knew
of, by which an Englishman could head that procession of shouting
black devils.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301382">One headed it already, as it happened; though he was unaware of the
supreme importance of the fact, ignorant of what lay behind him. Jim
Douglas, who had left Meerut all unwitting of that rescue party on its
way to the jail, was still about a mile from the half-way house where
he expected to find his relay. He had had the greatest difficulty in
getting the drugged mare to go at all at first, and more than once had
regretted having refused old Tiddu's advice. She had pulled herself
together a bit, but she was in a drip of sweat<pb xml:id="fswater_1301381" n="184 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> and still shaky on her feet. Not that it
mattered, he being close now, to Begum-a-bad with plenty of time to
reach Delhi by dawn.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301383">He rather preferred to pace slowly, his feet out of the stirrups,
his slight easy figure dressed, as it always was when in English
costume, with the utmost daintiness, sitting well back in the
saddle. For the glamour of the moonlight, the stillness of the night
possessed him; everything so soundless save when the jackals
began--there were a number of them about--A good hunting country--the
memory of many a run in his youthful days, with a bobbery pack, came
to him.--After all he had had the cream of life in a way.--Few men had
enjoyed theirs more, for even this idle pacing through the stillness
was a pleasure--Pleasure?--How many he had had! His mind, reverting
from one to another, thought even of the owner of the golden curl
without regret. She had taught him the religion of Love, the adoration
of a spotless woman. And Zora, dear little Zora; had taught him the
purity of passion. And then his mind went back suddenly to a scene of
his boyhood--a boy of eighteen carrying a girl of sixteen, who held a
string of sea-trout midway in a wide deep ford. And he heard, as if it
had been yesterday, the faint splash of the fish as they slipped one
by one into the water, and felt the fierce fighting of the girl to be
set down, his own stolid resistance, and listened to their mutual
abuse of each other's obstinacy and carelessness. Yes! he would like
to see his sisters once more, to know that pleasure again. Then his
mind took another leap. Alice Gissing had not struggled in his hold,
because she had been in unison with his ideal of conduct; but if she
had not been, she would have fought as viciously, as unconsciously, as
any sister. Alice Gissing who--He settled his feet into the stirrups
sternly, thinking of that telegram with its one word 'Come,' which
ended so many chances.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301384">Hark! What was that? A clatter of hoofs behind! And something more,
surely. A jingle, a jangle, familiar to his soldier's ears--cavalry at
the gallop! He drew aside hastily into the shadow of the arcaded trees
and waited.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301385">Cavalry, no doubt; and the moon shone on their drawn sabres. By
Heaven! Troopers of the 3rd!--Half-a-dozen or more!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301387">'<hi rend="italic">Shâh bâsh</hi>, brothers,' cried
one as they swept past, 'we can<pb xml:id="fswater_1301386" n="185 NIGHT"/> breathe our
beasts a bit at Begum-a-bad and let the others come up; no need to
reach Delhi ere dawn. The Palace would be closed.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301388">Delhi! The Palace! And who were the others? That, if they were
coming behind, could soon be settled. He turned the Belooch and
trotted her back in the shadow, straining eyes and ears down the
tree-fringed road which lay so still, so white, so silent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301389">Something was on it now, but something silent, almost
ghost-like--an old man, muttering texts, on a lame camel which bumped
along as even no earthly camel ought to bump. That could not be the
'others?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301390">No! Surely that was a thud, a jingle, a clatter, once more? and
once more the glitter of cold steel in the moonlight--forty or fifty
of the 3rd this time, with stragglers calling to others still further
behind 'To Delhi! To Delhi! To Victory or Death.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301391">As he stood waiting for them all to pass ere he moved, his first
thought was, that with all these armed men at Begum-abad there would
be no chance of a remount. Then came a swift wonder as to what had
happened. A row of some sort, of course, and these men had fled. Ere
long, no doubt, a squadron of Carabineers would come rattling after
them. No! That was not cavalry. That was infantry in the distance!
Quite a number of men shouting the same cry--men of the 20th, to judge
by what he could see. Then the row had been a big one! Still the men
were evidently fugitives, and there was that in their recurring cry
which told of almost hopeless, reckless enthusiasm.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301393">And how the devil was he to get his remount? It was to be at the
semi on the road-side, the very place where these men would rest. Yet
he must get to Delhi, he must get there sharp! The possibility that
Delhi was unwarned did not occur to him; he only thought how he might
best get there in time for the row which must come. Should he wait for
the English troops to come up, and chance his remount being coolly
taken by the first rebel who wanted one? Or, Delhi being not more than
fifteen miles off across country, should he take the mare as far as
she would go, leave her in some field, and do the rest on foot? He
looked at his watch. Half-past one! Say five miles in
half-an-hour. The mare was good for that. Then ten miles, at five
miles an hour.<pb xml:id="fswater_1301392" n="186 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> The very
first glimmer of light should see him at the boat bridge if--if the
mare could gallop five miles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301394">He must try her a bit slowly first. So, slipping across the broad
white streak of road to the Delhi side, he took her slanting through
the tall tiger grass--for they were close on a <hi rend="italic">nullah</hi> which must be forded by a rather deep ford
lower down, since the bridge was denied to him. About half a mile from
the road he came upon the track suddenly, in the midst of high
tamarisk jungle growing in heavy sand, and the next moment was on the
shining levels of the ford. The mare strained on his hand, and he
paused to let her have a mouthful of water. As she stood there, head
down, a horseman at the canter showed suddenly, silently, behind him,
not five yards away, his horse hoofs deadened by the sand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301395">There was a hasty movement, an ominous click on both sides. But the
moon was too bright for mistakes; the recognition was mutual.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301396">'My God, Erlton!' he cried, as the other, without a pause, went on
into the ford. 'What's up?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301397">'Is it fordable?' came the quick question, and as Jim Douglas for
an answer gave a dig with his spurs, the Major slackened visibly; his
eye telling him that the depth could not be taken, save at a walk.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301398">'What's up?' he echoed fiercely. 'Mutiny! murder! I say, how far am
I from Delhi?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301399">'Delhi!' cried Jim Douglas, his voice keen as a knife. 'By heaven!
you don't mean they don't know--that they didn't wire--but the
troops--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301400">'Hadn't started when I left,' said the Major with a curse. 'I came
on alone. I say, Douglas,' he gave a sharp glance at the other's mount
and there was a pause.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301402">'My mare's beat--been drugged,' said Jim Douglas in the swish-swish
of the water rising higher and higher on the horses' breasts, and
there was a curious tone in his voice as if he were arguing out
something to himself. 'I've a remount at the <hi rend="italic">serai</hi>, but the odds are a hundred to one on my
getting it. I'd given up the chance of it. I meant to take the mare as
many miles across country as she'd go--more, perhaps--for she feels
like falling at a fence, and walk the rest. I didn't know then--' he
paused and looked ahead. The water, up to the girths, made a curious
rushing sound, like many wings. The long shiny levels stretched away
softly,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301401" n="187 NIGHT"/> mysteriously. The tamarisk jungle
reflected in the water seemed almost as real as that which edged the
shining sky. A white egret stood in the shallows; tall, ghostly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301403">'I thought it was only--a row.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301404">The voice ceased again, the breathings of the tired horses had
slackened; there was no sound but that rushing, as of wings, as those
two enemies rode side by side looking ahead. Suddenly Jim Douglas
turned.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301405">'You ride nigh four stone heavier than I do, Major Erlton.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301406">The heavy handsome face came round swiftly, all broken up with
sheer passion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301407">'Do you suppose I haven't been thinking that ever since I saw your
cursed face. And you know the country, and I don't. You know the lingo
and I don't. And--and--you're a deuce sight better rider than I am,
d--n you! But for all that, it's my chance, I tell you. My chance, not
yours.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301408">A great surge of sympathy swept through the other man's veins. But
the water was shallowing rapidly. A step or two and this must be
decided.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301409">'It's yours more than mine,' he said slowly, 'but it isn't ours, is
it? It's the others, in Delhi.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301410">Herbert Erlton gave an odd sound between a sob and an oath, a
savage jag at the bridle as the little Arab, overweighted, slipped a
bit coming up the bank. Then, without a word, he flung himself from
the saddle and set to work on the stirrup nearest him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301411">'How many holes?' he asked gruffly, as Jim Douglas, with a great
ache in his heart, left the Belooch standing, and began on the
other.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301412">'Three; you're a good bit longer in the leg than I am.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301413">'I suppose I am,' said the Major, sullenly; but he held the stirrup
for the other to mount.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301414">Jim Douglas gathered the reins in his hand and paused. 'You had
better walk her back. Keep more to the left; it's easier.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301415">'Oh! I'll do,' came the sullen voice. 'Stop a bit, the curb's too
tight.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301416">'Take it off, will you? he knows me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301417">Major Erlton gave an odd, quick, bitter laugh. 'I suppose he
does. Right you are!'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301418" n="188 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301419">He stood, putting the curb chain into his pocket, mechanically, but
Jim Douglas paused again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301420">'Good-bye! Shake hands on it, Erlton.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301421">The Major looked at him resentfully, the big coarse hand came
reluctantly; but the touch of that other, like iron in its grip its
determination, seemed to rouse something deeper than anger.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301422">'The odds are on you,' he said, with a quiver in his voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301423">'You'll look after her--not my wife, she's in cantonments--but in
the city, you know.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301424">The voice broke suddenly. He threw out one hand in a sort of
passionate despair, and walked over to the Beloochi.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301425">'I'll do everything you could possibly do in my place, Erlton.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301426">The words came clear and stern, and the next instant the thud of
the Arab's galloping hoofs filled the still night air. The sound sent
a spasm of angry pain through Major Erlton. The chance had been his,
and he had had to give it up because he rode three stone heavier--and
curse it! knew only too well what a difference a pound or two might
make in a race.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301427">Nevertheless Jim Douglas had been right when he said the chance was
neither his nor the Major's. For less than an hour afterwards, riding
all he knew, doing his level best, the Arab put its foot in a rat hole
just as his rider was congratulating himself on having headed the
rebels; just as, across the level plain stretching from Ghazeabad to
the only bridge over the Jumna, he fancied he could see a big shadowy
bubble on the western sky--the dome of the Delhi mosque. Put its foot
in a rat hole and came down heavily. The last thing Jim Douglas saw
was--on the road which he had hoped to rejoin in a minute or two--a
strange ghostlike figure. An old man on a lame camel, which bumped
along as even no earthly camel ought to bump.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301428">As he fell, the rushing roar in his ears which heralds
unconsciousness seemed by freak of memory to take a familiar
rhythm--</p><q><l>'<hi rend="italic">La! il-lah-il-ullaho!

the river, and ruffling the calm stretches below the Palace wall died
away again as an oldish man stepped out of a reed hut, built on a
sandbank beside the boat-bridge, and looked eastwards. He was a <hi rend="italic">poojari</hi>, or master of ceremonial at the
bathing-place where, with the first streak of light, the Hindoos came
to perform their religious ablutions. So he had to be up betimes in
order to prepare the little saucers of vermillion and sandal and
sacred gypsum needed in his profession; for he earned his livelihood
by inherited right of hall-marking his fellow-creatures with their
caste-signs when they came up out of the water. Thus he looked out
over those eastern plains for the dawn, day after day.<ref target="#fswatern189">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern189" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">He looks for it still; this account is from his
lips.</note> And this dawn there was a cloud of dust no bigger than a
man's hand upon the Meerut road. Some one was coming to Delhi.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301431">But some one was already on the bridge, for it creaked and swayed,
sending little shivers of ripples down the calm stretches. The <hi rend="italic">poojari</hi> turned and looked to see the cause; then
turned eastward again. It was only a man on a camel with a strange
gait, bumping noiselessly even on the resounding wood. That was
all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301433">The city was still asleep; though here and there a widow was
stealing out in her white shroud for that touch of the sacred river
without which she would be indeed accursed. And in a little mosque
hard by the road from the boat-bridge a <hi rend="italic">muazzin</hi>
was about to give the very first call to prayer with pious
self-complacency. But some one was ahead of him in devotion, for, upon
the still air, came a continuous rolling of chanted texts. The <hi rend="italic">muazzin</hi> leant over the parapet, disappointed, to
see who had thus forestalled him at heaven's gate; stared, then
muttered a hasty charm. Were there visions about? The suggestion
softened the disappointment, and he looked after the strange wild
figure, half-seen in the shimmering, shadowy dawn-light, with growing
and awed satisfaction. This was no mere mortal, this green-clad
figure<pb xml:id="fswater_1301432" n="190 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> on a camel, chanting
texts and waving a scimitar. A vision had been vouchsafed to him for
his diligence; a vision that would not lose in the telling. So he
stood up and gave the cry from full lungs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301434">'<hi rend="italic">Prayer is more than sleep! than steep! than
sleep!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301435">The echo from the rose-red fortifications took it up first; then
one chanting voice after another, monotonously insistent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301436">'<hi rend="italic">Prayer is more than sleep! than sleep! than
sleep!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301437">And the city woke to another day of fasting. Woke hurriedly, so as
to find time for food ere the sun rose, for it was Rumzân, and
one half of the inhabitants would have no drop of water till the sun
set, to assuage the terrible drought of every living, growing thing
beneath the fierce May sun. The backwaters lay like a steel mirror
reflecting the grey shadowy pile of the palace, the <hi rend="italic">poojari</hi>--waist-deep in them--was a solitary figure
flinging water to the sacred airts, absorbed in a thorough
purification from sin.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301438">Then, from the serrated line of the Ridge came a bugle followed by
the roll of a time gun. All the world was waking now; waking to give
orders, to receive them, waking to mark itself apart with signs of
salvation, waking to bow westwards and pray for the discomfiture of
the infidel, waking to stand on parade and salute the royal standard
of a ruler, hell-doomed inevitably, according to both creeds.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301439">A flock of purple pigeons startled by the sound, rose like cloud
flakes on the light grey sky above the glimmering dome of the big
mosque, then flew westward towards the green fields and groves on the
further side of the town. For the roll of the gun was followed by a
reverberating roll, and groan, and creak, from the boat bridge. The
little cloud on the Meerut road, had grown into five troopers dashing
over the bridge at a gallop recklessly. The <hi rend="italic">poojari</hi>, busy now with his pigments, followed them
with his eyes as they clattered straight for the city gate. They were
waking in the Palace by this time, for a slender hand set a lattice
wide; perhaps from curiosity, perhaps simply to let in the cool air of
dawn. It was a lattice in the women's apartments.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301441">The <hi rend="italic">poojari</hi> went on rubbing up the colours
that were to bring such spiritual pride to the wearers, then turned to
look again. The troopers, finding the city gate closed, were back once
more clamouring for admittance through the low arched doorway leading
from Selimgarh to the Palace. And as the yawning custodian<pb xml:id="fswater_1301440" n="191   DAWN"/> fumbled for his keys, the men cursed and swore at the delay--for in truth they
knew not what lay behind them. The Two Thousand from Meerut, or some
of them, of course. But at what distance?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301442">As a matter of fact only one Englishman was close enough to be
considered a pursuer, and he was but a poor creature on foot, still
dazed by a fall, striking across country to reach the
Râj-ghât ferry below the city. For when Jim Douglas had
recovered consciousness it had been to recognise that he was too late
to be the first in Delhi, and that he could only hope to help in the
struggle; and that tardily, for the Arab was dead lame.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301443">So, removing its saddle and bridle to give it a better chance of
escaping notice, he had left it grazing peacefully in a field and
stumbled on riverwards, intending to cross it as best he could and so
make for his own house in Duryagunj for a fresh horse and a more
suitable kit. And as he plodded along doggedly he cursed the sheer
ill-luck which had made him late.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301444">For he <hi rend="italic">was</hi> late.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301445">The five troopers were already galloping through the Grape-garden
towards the women's apartments and the king's sleeping-rooms.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301446">Their shouts of 'The King! The King! Help for the martyrs! Help for
the Holy War!' dumbfoundered the court <hi rend="italic">muazzim</hi>
who was going late to his prayers in the Pearl Mosque. The reckless
hoofs sent a squatting bronze image of a gardener, threading jasmine
chaplets for his gods peacefully in the pathway, flying into a rose
bush.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301447">'The King! The King! Help! Help!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301448">The women woke with the cry, confused, alarmed, surprised; save one
or two who, creeping quickly to the Queen's room, found her awake,
excited, calling to her maids.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301449">'Too soon!' she echoed contemptuously. 'Can a good thing come too
soon? Quick, woman--I must see the King at once--nay, I will go as I
am if it comes to that.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301450">'The physician Ahsan-Oolah hath arrived as usual for the dawn
pulse-feeling,' protested the shocked tirewoman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301452">'All the more need for hurry,' retorted Zeenut Maihl. 'Quick!
Slippers and a veil! Thine will do, Fâtma; sure what makes thee
decent--' she gave a spiteful laugh as she snatched it from the
woman's head and passed to the door;<pb xml:id="fswater_1301451" n="192 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> but there she paused a second. 'See if Hâfzan be
below. I bid her come early, so she should be. Tell her to write word
to Hussan Askari to dream as he never dreamt before! And see--' her
voice grew shriller, keener, '--the rest of you have leave. Go! cozen
every man you know, every man you meet. I care not how. Make their
blood flow! I care not wherefore, so that it leaps and bounds, and
would spill other blood that checked it.' She clenched her hands as
she passed on muttering to herself. 'Ah! if <hi rend="italic">he</hi>
were a man--if <hi rend="italic">his</hi> blood were not chilled with
age--if I had some one--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301453">She broke off into smiles; for in the anteroom she entered was, man
or no man, the representative of the Great Moghul.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301454">'Ah, Zeenut!' he cried in tones of relief. 'I would have sought
thee.' The trembling shrunken figure in its wadded-silk dressing-gown
paused and gave a backward glance at Ahsan-Oolah, whose shrewd face
was full of alarm.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301455">'Believe nothing, my liege!' he protested eagerly. 'These rioters
are boasters. Are there not two thousand British soldiers in Meerut?
Their tale is not possible. They are cowards fled from defeat, liars,
hoping to be saved at your expense. The thing is impossible.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301456">The Queen turned on him passionately. 'Are not all things possible
with God, and is not His Majesty the Defender of the Faith!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301457">'But not defender of five runaway rioters,' sneered the
physician. 'My liege! Remember your pension.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301458">Zeenut Maihl glared at his cunning; it was an argument needing all
her art to combat.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301459">'Five!' she echoed, passing to the lattice quickly. 'Then miracles
are about--the five have grown to fifty. Look, my lord, look! Hark!
How they call on the Defender of the Faith.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301460">With reckless hand she set the lattice wide, so becoming visible
for an instant; and a shout of 'the Queen, the Queen,' mingled with
that other of 'the Faith! the Faith! Lead us, Oh!
Ghazee-o-din-Bahâdur-shâh, to die for the faith.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301461">Pale as he was with age, the cry stirred the blood in the King's
veins and sent it to his face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301462">'Stand back,' he cried in sudden dignity, waving both counsellors
aside with trembling outstretched hands. 'I will speak mine own
words.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301464">But the sight of him, rousing a fresh burst of enthusiasm,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301463" n="193 DAWN"/> left him no possibility of speech for a time. The
Lord had been on their side, they cried. They had killed every
hell-doomed infidel in Meerut! They would do so in Delhi if he would
help! They were but an advanced guard of an army coining from every
cantonment in India to swear allegiance to the Pâdishah. Long
live the King! and the Queen!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301465">In the dim room behind, Zeenut Maihl and the physician listened to
the wild almost incredible tale which drifted in with the scented air
from the garden, and watched each other silently. Each found in it
fresh cause for obstinacy. If this were true, what need to be
foolhardy?--time would show, the thing come of itself without risk. If
this were true, decisive action should be taken at once--and would be
taken.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301466">But the King, assailed, molested, by that rude interrupting
loyalty--above all by that cry for the Queen--felt the Turk stir in
him also. Who were these intruders in the sacred precincts, infringing
the seclusion of the Great Moghul's women? Trembling with impotent
passion, inherited from passions that had not been impotent, he turned
to Ahsan-Oolah, ignoring the Queen, who, he felt, was mostly to blame
for this outrage on her modesty. Why had she come there? Why had she
dared to be seen?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301467">'Your Majesty should send for the Captain of the Palace Guards and
bid him disperse the rioters, and force them into respect for your
royal person,' suggested the physician, carefully avoiding all but the
immediate present, 'and your Majesty should pass to the Hall of
Audience. The King can scarce receive the Captain-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> here in presence of the Consort.' He did not
add 'in her present costume'--but his tone implied it, and the King,
with an angry mortified glance towards his favourite, took the
physician's arm. If looks could kill, Ahsan-Oolah would not, he knew,
have supported those tottering steps far; but it was no time to stick
at trifles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301468">When they had passed from the anteroom Zeenut Maihl still stood as
if half stupefied by the insult. Then she dashed to the open lattice
again, scornful and defiant, dignified into positive beauty for the
moment by her recklessness.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301469">'For the Faith!' she cried in her shrill woman's voice, 'if ye are
men, as I would <hi rend="italic">be</hi>, to be loved of woman as I
am, strike for the Faith!'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301470" n="194 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301471">A sort of shiver ran through the clustering crowd of men below; the
shiver of anticipation, of the marvellous, the unexpected. The Queen
had spoken to them as men; of herself as
woman. Inconceivable!--improper of course--yet exciting. Their blood
thrilled, the instinct of the man to fight for the woman rose at
once.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301472">'Quick, brothers! Rouse the guard! Close the gates! Close the
gates!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301473">It was a cry to heal all strife within those rose-red walls, for
the dearest wish of every faction was to close them against
civilisation; against those prying Western eyes and sniffing Western
noses, detecting drains and sinks of iniquity. So the clamour grew,
and faces which had frowned at each other yesterday sought support in
each other's ferocity to-day, and wild tales began to pass from mouth
to mouth. Men, crowding recklessly over the flower-beds, trampling
down the roses, talked of visions, of signs and warnings, while the
troopers, dismounting for a pull at a pipe, became the centre of eager
circles listening not to dreams, but deeds.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301474">'Dost feel the rope about thy neck, Sir Martyr?' said a bitter
jeering voice behind one of the speakers; and something gripped him
round the throat, then as suddenly loosed its hold, as a shrouded
woman's figure hobbled on through the crowd. The trooper started up
with an oath, his own hand seeking his throat involuntarily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301475">'Heed her not!' said a bystander hastily ''tis the Queen's scribe,
Hâfzan. She hath a craze against men. One made her what she
is. Go on! <hi rend="italic">Havildar-jee</hi>. So thou did'st cut the
<hi rend="italic">mem</hi> down, and fling the babe--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301476">But the doer of the deed stood silent. He did in truth seem to feel
the rope about his neck; and he seemed to feel it till he died--when
it was there.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301477">But Hâfzan had passed on, and there were no more with words
of warning; so the clamour grew and grew, till the garden swarmed with
men ready for any deed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301478">Ahsan-Oolah saw this, and laid a detaining hand on the Captain of
the Guard, who, summoned in hot haste from his quarters over the
Lahore gate, came in by the private way, and proposed to go down and
harangue the crowd.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301479">'It is not safe, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>,' he cried. 'My
liege! detain him. These men by their own confession are
murderers--'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301480" n="195 DAWN"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301481">The King looked from one to the other doubtfully. Some one must get
rid of the rioters; yet the physician said truth--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301482">--'And if aught befall,' added the latter craftily, 'your Majesty
will be held responsible.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301483">The old man's hand fell instantly on the Englishman's arm 'Nay,
nay, <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>! go not. Go not, my friend! Speak to
them from the balcony. They will not dare to violate it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301484">So, backed by the sanctity of the Audience Hall of a dead dynasty,
the Englishman stood and ordered the crowd to desist from profaning
privacy, in the name of the old man behind him, whose power he, in
common with all his race, hoped and believed to be dead. It was
sufficient, however, to leave some respect for the royal person, and
make the crowd disperse; but to little purpose so far as peace and
quiet went, since the only effect was to send a leaven of revolt to
every corner of the palace--and the palace was so full of malcontents,
docked of power, privilege, pensions--of all that makes life in a
palace worth living.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301485">So the cry 'Close the gates' grew wider. The dazed old king clung
to the Englishman's arm imploring him to stay; but now a messenger
came running to say that the Commissioner-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>
had called, and left word that the <hi rend="italic">Captân</hi> was to follow without delay
to the Calcutta gate of the city. The courtiers, who had begun to
assemble, looked at each other curiously; the disturbance, then, had
spread beyond the palace. Could then, this amazing tale be true? The
very thought sent them cringing round the old man, who might ere long
be king indeed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301487">Yet as the captain dashed at a gallop past the sentries standing
calmly at the Lahore gate, there was no sign of trouble beyond, and he
gave a quick glance of relief back at those cool quarters of his over
the arched tunnel where the chaplain, his daughter, and her friend
were staying as his guests. He felt less fear of leaving them when he
saw that the city was waking to life as always, buckling down quietly
to the burden and heat of a new day. It was now past seven o'clock,
and the sunlight, still cool, was bright enough to cleave all things
into dark or light, shade or shine. Up on the Ridge, the brigade,
after listening to the sentence on the Barrackpore mutineers was
dispersing quietly; many of the men with that fiat of patience
till<pb xml:id="fswater_1301486" n="196 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> the 31st in their
minds, for the carriage-load of native officers returning from the
Meerut court-martial had come into cantonments late the night
before. On the roofs of the houses in the learned quarter women were
giving the boys their breakfasts ere sending them off to school. The
milkwomen were trooping in city-wards from the country, the
fruit-sellers and hawkers trooping out Ridge-ways as usual. The
postman going his rounds had left letters, written in Meerut the day
before, at two houses. And Kate Erlton returning from early church had
found hers and was reading it with a scared face. Alice Gissing,
however, having had that laconic telegram had taken hers coolly. The
decision had had to be made, since nothing had happened; and Herbert
had the right to make it. For her part, she could make him happy; she
had the knack of making most men happy, and she herself was always
content when the people about her were jolly. So she was packing boxes
in the back verandah of the little house on the city wall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301488">Thus she did not see the man who, between six and seven o'clock,
ran breathlessly past her house, as a short-cut to the court-house
from the bridge, taking a message from the toll-keeper to the nearest
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, the Collector, who was holding early
office, that a party of armed troopers had come down the Meerut road;
that more could be seen coming, and would the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> kindly issue orders--that first and final
suggestion of the average native subordinate in any difficulty.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301494">Armed men? That might mean much or nothing. Yet scarcely anything
really serious, or warning would have been sent. The Commissioner,
anyhow, must he told. So the Collector flung himself on his horse,
which, in Indian fashion, was waiting under a tree outside the
court-house, and galloped towards Ludlow Castle. No need for <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
warning, however, for just by the Kashmir Gate he met the man he
sought driving furiously down with a mounted escort to close the city
gates. He had already heard the news.<ref target="#fswatern196">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern196" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth"><p xml:id="fswater_1301489">How? His house lay a mile at least further off, and
the Collector's office was on the only route a messenger could
take. No record explains this. But the best ones mention casually that
a telegram of warning came to Delhi in the early morning of the
11th. Whence? The wires to Meerut were cut. Lahore, Umballa, Agra, did
not know the news themselves. Can the story--improbable in any other
history, but in this record of fatal mistakes gaining a pathetic
probability--which the old folk in Delhi tell be true? The story of a
telegram sent unofficially from Meerut the night before, received
while the Commissioner was at dinner, put unopened into his pocket,
and <hi rend="italic">forgotten.</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301490">Not susceptible of proof or disproof, it certainly explains three
things:--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301491">1. Whence the warning telegram came.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301492">2. Why the Commissioner received information before a man a good
mile nearer the source.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301493">3. Why the Collector <hi rend="italic">at once</hi> sought for
military aid.</p></note></p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301495" n="197 DAWN"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301496">Gathering graver apprehensions from this hasty meeting, the
Collector was off again to warn the Resident; then--still further--to
beg help from cantonments. There was no delay here, no hesitation;
simply a man on a horse doing his best for the future, leaving the
present for those on the spot.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301497">Nor was there delay anywhere. The Commissioner, calling by the way
for the Captain of the Guard--the nearest man with men under him--was
at the gate giving on the bridge of boats, by half-past seven. The
Resident, calling on <hi rend="italic">his</hi> way at the magazine
for two guns to sweep the bridge, joined him there soon after. Too
late. The enemy had crossed, and were in possession of the only ground
commanding the bridge. Nothing remained but to close the gate and keep
the city quiet till the columns of pursuit from Meerut should arrive;
for that there was one upon the road no one doubted. The very rebels
clamouring at the gate were listening for the sound of those following
footsteps. The very fanatics, longing for another blow or two at an
infidel, to gain Paradise withal, ere martyrdom was theirs, listened
too; for during that moonlit night the certainty of failure had been
as myrrh and hyssop deadening them to the sacrifice of life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301498">So the little knot of Englishmen, looking hopefully down the road,
looked anxiously at each other, and closed the river gate; kept it
closed, too, even when the 20th claimed admittance from their friends
the guard within; for the 38th regiment, whose turn it was for city
work, was also rotten to the core.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301500">But they could not close that way through Selimgarh, though it, in
truth, brought no trouble to the town. The men who chose it being
intriguers, fanatics, the better class of patriots more anxious to
entrench themselves for the struggle within walls, than to swarm into
a town they could<pb xml:id="fswater_1301499" n="198 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> not hope
to hold. But there were others of different mettle, longing for loot
and license. The 3rd Cavalry had many friends in Delhi, especially in
the Thunbi bazaar; so they made for it by braving the shallow streams
and shifting sandbanks below the eastern wall, and so gaining the
Rajghât gate. Here, after compact with vile friends in that
vile quarter, they found admittance and help. For what?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301501">Between the bazaar and the palace lay Duryagunj, full of helpless
Christian women and children; and so, '<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen!
Futteh Mahomed</hi>,' the convenient cry of faith, was ready as,
followed by the rabble and refuse once more, the troopers raced
through the peaceful gardens, pausing only to kill the infidels they
met. But like a furious wind gathering up all vile things in the
street and carrying them along for a space, then dropping them again,
the band left a legacy of license and sheer murder behind it, while it
sped on to loot.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301502">But now the cry of 'Close the gates' rose once more, this time from
the shopkeepers, the respectable quarters, the secluded alleys, the
courtyards. And many a door was closed on the confusion and never
opened again, <hi rend="italic">except to pass in bare bread, for four
long months.</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301503">'Close the gates! Close the gates! Close the gates!' The cry rose
from the palace, the city, the little knot of Englishmen looking down
the Meerut road. Yet no one could compass that closing. Recruits
swarmed in through Selimgarh to the palace. Robbers swarmed in through
the Rajghât gate to harry the bazaars. Only through the Kashmir
gate, held by English officers and a guard of the 38th, no help
came. The Collector arriving therein, hot from his gallop to
cantonments, found more wonder than alarm; for death was dealt in
Delhi by noiseless cold steel; and, since the main guard had to be
kept, in order to secure retreat and safety to the European houses
around it, no one had been able to leave it. Besides all around was
still peaceful utterly; even the roar of growing tumult in the city
had not reached it. Sonny Seymour was playing with his parrot in the
verandah, Alice Gissing packing boxes methodically. The Collector
galloping past as, scorning the suggestion that it was needless risk
to go further, he replied briefly that he was the magistrate of the
town and struck spurs to his horse, made some folk look up; that was
all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301505">But he could scarcely make his way through the growing<pb xml:id="fswater_1301504" n="199 DAWN"/> crowd, which, led by troopers, was beginning to
close in behind the knot of waiting Englishmen, who, when they heard
that some time must elapse ere they could hope for reinforcement, once
more looked down the Meerut road. The guns could not be got ready,
said the messenger, at a moment's notice; nor could the Kashmir-gate
guard leave the post. But the 54th regiment should be down in
about--In about what? No one asked; but those waiting faces listened
as for a verdict of life and death--In about an hour.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301506">An hour! And not a cloud of dust upon the Meerut road!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301507">'They can't be long, though, now,' said the eldest there
hopefully. 'And Ripley will bring his men down at the double. If we go
into the guard-house we can hold our own till then, surely.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301508">'I can hold mine,' replied a young fellow with a rough-hewn, homely
face. He gave a curt nod as he spoke to a companion, and together they
turned back, skirting the wall, followed by an older, burlier
man. They belonged to the magazine, and they were off to see the best
way of holding their own. And they found it--found it for all
time!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301509">But fate had denied to those other brave men, the nameless
something which makes men succeed together, or die together. Within
half-an-hour they were scattered helplessly. The Resident, after
seeking support from the city police for one whose name had been a
terror to Delhi for fifty years, and finding insult instead, was
flying for dear life through the Ajmere gate to the open country. The
Commissioner, who, after seizing a musket from a wavering guard beside
him and--with the first shot fired in Delhi--shooting the foremost
trooper dead, seems to have lost hope with mutiny around and treason
beside him, jumped into his buggy alone and drove off to those cool
quarters above the Palace-gate as his nearest refuge. Their owner, the
Captain, sought like refuge by flinging himself into the cover of the
dry moat and creeping--despite injuries from the fall--along it, till
some of his men, faithful so far, seeing him unable for more, carried
him to his own room.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301511">The Collector?--Strangely enough there is no record of what the
Magistrate of the city did, thus left alone. He had been wounded by
the crowd at first, and was no doubt weary after his wild
gallopings. Still he, holding his own so far,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301510" n="200 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> managed to gain the same refuge, somehow. What
else could he do alone? One thing we know he could not do. That is
mount the broad, curving flight of shallow stone stairs leading to the
cool upper rooms. So the chaplain helped him; the chaplain who had
'from an early hour been watching the advance of the Meerut mutineers
through a telescope, and feeling there was mischief in the wind.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301512">Mischief indeed! and danger; most of all in those rose-red walls
within which refuge had been sought. For the king was back in the
women's apartments, listening to the queen's cozenings and Hussan
Askuri's visions, when that urgent appeal to send dhoolies to convey
the English ladies at the gate to the security of the harem, reached
him--reached him in Ahsan-Oolah's warning voice of wisdom. And he
listened to both the wheedling ambition and the crafty policy with a
half-hearing for something beyond it of pity, honour, good faith;
while Hâfzan, pen in hand, sat with her large profoundly-sad
eyes fixed on the old man's face, waiting--waiting.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301513">'If they come here--out-caste! infidel! I go,' said Zeenut,
Maihl.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301514">'Thou shalt go with a bowstring about thy neck, woman, if I
choose,' said the old king fiercely. 'Write! girl--the queen's
dhoolies to the Lahore gate at once.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301515">So, through the swarm of pensioners quarrelling already over new
titles and perquisites, through the groups of excited fanatics
preparing for martyrdom about the Mosque, past Abool-Bukr, three parts
drunk, boasting to ruffling blades of the European mistresses he meant
to keep, the queen's dhoolies went swaying out of the precincts; all
yielding place to them. And beyond, in the denser, more dangerous
crowd without, they passed easily; for those tinsel-decked, tawdry
canopies, screened with sodden musk and dirt-scented curtains, were
sacred.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301517">Sacred even to the refuse and rabble of the city, the dissolute
eunuchs, the mob of retainers, palace guards, and blood-drunk soldiery
who were surging through that long arched tunnel by the Lahore gate,
hustling to get round that inside arch, and so, a few steps further,
see the Commissioner standing at bay upon that wide curving red-stone
stair that led upwards. Standing and thinking of the women above; of
one woman mostly. Standing, facing the wild sea of<pb xml:id="fswater_1301516" n="201 DAYLIGHT"/> faces, waiting to see if that last appeal for help had
been heard.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301518">'Room! Room! for the queen's dhoolies!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301519">The cry echoed above the roar of the crowd.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301520">At last! He turned-to pass on the welcome news, perchance; but it
was enough that one waver of the stern face was enough to bring
death. There was a rush--a cry--a clang of steel on stone--a fall--and
then up those wide curving stairs, like fiends incarnate, jostled a
mad crew elbowing each other, cursing each other, in their eagerness
for that blow which would win Paradise!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301521">There were four crowns of glory in the first room, where the
chaplain, the Captain, and the two English girls fell side by
side. One in the next, where the Collector and Magistrate, weary and
wounded, still lay alone.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301522">'Way! Way! for the queen's dhoolies!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301523">But they had come too late, as all things seemed to come too late
on that fatal 11th of May.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301524">Too late! Too late! The words dinned themselves into a horseman's
brain, as he dashed out of the compound of a small house in Duryagunj
and headed straight through the bazaar for the little house on the
city wall by the Kashmir gate. And as he rode he shouted: '<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301525">It was a convenient cry, and suited the trooper's dress he wore. He
had had to shoot a man to get it, but he hoped to shoot many more when
he had seen Alice Gissing in safety, and the Meerut column had come
in. It could not be long now.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0303" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III<lb/>DAYLIGHT</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301527">THREE miles away Kate Erlton sat in her home-like, peaceful
drawing-room, feeling dazzled. The sunshine, streaming through the
open doors, seemed to stream into the very recesses of her mind as she
sat, still looking at the letter which she had found half-an-hour
before waiting for her beside a bunch of late roses which the gardener
had laid on the table ready for her to arrange in the vases. The
flowers were fading fast, and the dog-cart, waiting outside to take
her on<pb xml:id="fswater_1301526" n="202 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> to see a sick friend
ere the sun grew hot, shifted to find another shadow; but she did not
move.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301528">She was trying to understand what it all meant; really--deprived of
her conventional thoughts about such things. And one sentence in the
letter had a strange fascination for her. 'I am not such a fool as to
think you will mind. I know you will get on much better without
me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301529">Of course. She had, in a way, accepted the truth of this years
ago. The fact must have been patent to him also all that time; and she
had known that he accepted it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301530">But now, set down in black and white, it forced her into seeing--as
she had never seen before--the deadly injury she had done to the man
by not minding. And then the question came keenly--'Why had she not
minded?' Because she had not been content with her bargain. She had
wanted something else. What? The emotion, the refinement, the <hi rend="italic">fin-fleur</hi> of sentiment. Briefly, what made <hi rend="italic">her</hi> happy; what gave <hi rend="italic">her</hi>
satisfaction. It was only, then, a question between different forms of
enjoyment; the one as purely selfish as the other. More so, in a way,
for it claimed more and carried the grievance of denial into every
detail of life. She moved restlessly in her chair, confused by this
sudden daylight in her mind; laid down the letter, then took it up
again and read another sentence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301531">'I believe you used to think that I'd get the regiment some day;
but I shouldn't--after all, the finish is the win or the lose of a
race.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301532">The letter went down on the table again, but this time her head
went down with it to rest upon it above her clasped hands. Oh! the
pity of it! the pity of it! Yet how could she have avoided standing
aloof from this man's life as she had done from the moment she had
discovered she did not love him?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301533">Suddenly she stood up, pressing those clasped hands tight to her
forehead as if to hold in her thoughts. The sunlight, streaming in,
shone right into her cool grey eyes showing in a ray on the iris, as
if it were passing into her very soul.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301535">If she had been this man's sister, instead of his wife, could she
not have lived with him contentedly enough, palliating what could be
palliated, gaining what influence she could with him, giving him
affection and sympathy? Why, briefly,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301534" n="203 DAYLIGHT"/> had
she failed to make him what Alice Gissing had made him--a better man?
And yet Alice Gissing did not love him; she had no romantic sentiment
about him. Did she really lay less stress--she, the woman at whom
other women held up pious hands of horror--on that elemental
difference between the tie of husband and wife and brother and sister
than she, Kate Erlton did, who had affected to rise superior to it
altogether? It seemed so. She had asked for a purely selfish
gratification of the mind. And Alice Gissing? A strange jealousy came
to her with the thought, not for herself, but for her husband--for the
man who was content to give up everything for a woman whom he 'loved
very dearly.' That was true. Kate had watched him for those three
months, and she had watched Mrs. Gissing too, and knew for a certainty
the latter gave him nothing any woman might not have given him if she
had been content to put her own claims for happiness, her own
gratification, her own mental passion aside. So a quick resolve came
to her. He must not give up the finish, the win or the lose of the
race, for so little. There was time yet for the chance. She had
pleaded for one with a man a year ago; she would plead for it with a
woman to-day.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301536">She passed into the verandah hastily, pausing involuntarily ere
getting into the dog-cart, before the still, sunlit beauty of that
panorama of the eastern plains, stretching away behind the gardens
which fringed the shining curves of the river. There was scarcely a
shadow anywhere, not a sign to tell that three miles down that river
the man with whom she had pleaded a year ago was straining every nerve
to give her and himself a chance, and that within the rose-lit,
lilac-shaded city, the chance of some had come and gone.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301538">Nor, as she drove along the road intent on that coming interview in
the hot little house upon the wall, was there any sign to warn her of
danger. The Kashmir gate stood open, and the guard saluted as
usual. Perhaps, had the English officers seen her, they might have
advised her return, even though there was as yet no anticipation of
danger--had there been one, the first thought would have been to clear
the neighbouring bungalows. But they were in the main-guard, and she
set down the stare of the natives to the fact that nine o'clock was
unusually late for an English lady to be braving the May sun. The road
beyond was also unusually<pb xml:id="fswater_1301537" n="204 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
deserted, but she was too busy searching for the winged words, barbed
well, yet not too swift or sharp to wound beyond possibility of
compromise, which she meant to use ere long, to pay any attention to
her surroundings. She did not even catch the glimpse of Sonny, still
playing with the cockatoo, as she sped past the Seymour's house, and
she scarcely noticed the groom's '<hi rend="italic">Hut! teri,
hut!</hi>' (Out of the way! you there!) to a figure in a green turban,
over which she nearly ran, as it came sneaking round a corner as if
looking for something or some one; a figure which paused to look after
her half-doubtfully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301539">Yet these same words, which came so readily to her imaginings,
failed her, as set words will, before the commonplace matter-of-fact
reality. If she could have jumped from 'the dog-cart and dashed into
them without preamble, she would have been eloquent enough; but the
necessary inquiry if Mrs. Gissing could see her, the ushering in as
for an ordinary visit, the brief waiting, the perfunctory hand-shake
with the little figure in familiar white-and-blue were so far from the
high-strung appeal in her thoughts that they left her silent, almost
shy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301540">'Find a comfy chair, do,' came the high, hard voice. 'Isn't it
dreadfully hot? My old Mai will have it something is going to
happen. She has been <hi rend="italic">dikking</hi> me about it all
the morning. An earthquake, I suppose; it feels like it, rather. Don't
you think so?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301541">Kate felt as if one had come already, as, quite automatically, she
satisfied Alice Gissing's choice of 'a really-really comfy chair.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301542">How dizzily unreal it seemed! And yet not more so, in fact, than
the life they had been leading for months past; knowing the truth
about each other absolutely; pretending to know nothing. Well! the
sooner that sort of thing came to an end, the better!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301543">'I have had a letter from my husband,' she began, but had to pause
to steady her voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301545">'So I supposed, when I saw you,' replied Alice Gissing, without a
quiver in hers. But she rose, crossed over to Kate, and stood before
her, like a naughty child, her hands behind her back. She looked
strangely young, strangely innocent in the dim light of the sunshaded
room. So young, so small, so slight among the endless frills and laces
of a loose morning<pb xml:id="fswater_1301544" n="205 DAYLIGHT"/> wrapper. And she spoke
like a child also, querulously, petulantly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301546">'I like you the better for coming, too, though I don't see what
possible good it can do. He said in his letter to me he would tell you
all about it, and if he has, I don't see what else there is to say, do
you?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301547">Kate rose also, as if to come nearer to her adversary, and so the
two women stood, looking boldly enough into each other's eyes. But the
keenness, the passion, the pity of the scene, had somehow gone out of
it for Kate Erlton. Her tongue seemed tied by the tameness; she felt
that they might have been discussing a trivial detail in some trivial
future. Yet she fought against the feeling.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301548">'I think there is a great deal to say; that is why I have come to
say it,' she replied, after a pause. 'But I can say it quickly. You
don't love my husband, Alice Gissing, let him go. Don't ruin his
life.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301549">Bald and crude as this was in comparison with her imagined appeal,
it gave the gist of it, and Kate watched her hearer's face anxiously,
to see the effect. Was that by chance a faint smile? or was it only
the barred light from the jalousies hitting the wide blue eyes?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301550">'Love!' echoed Alice Gissing. 'I don't know anything about love. I
never pretended to. But I can make him happy; you never did.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301551">There was not a trace of malice in the high voice. It simply stated
a fact; but a fact so true that Kate's lip quivered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301552">''I know that as well as you do. But I think I could--now. I want
you to give me the chance.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301553">She had not meant to put it so humbly; but, being once more the
gist of what she had intended to say, it must pass. There was no doubt
about the smile now. It was almost a laugh--that hateful, inconsequent
laugh; but as if to soften its effect, a little jewelled hand hovered
out as if it sought a resting-place on Kate's arm.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301555">'You can't, my dear. It is so funny that you can't see that, when
I, who know nothing about--about all that--can see it quite
plainly. You are the sort of woman, Mrs. Erlton, who falls in
love--who must fall in love--who--don't be angry!--likes being in
love, and is unhappy if she isn't. Now I don't care a rap for people
to be thinking, and thinking, and thinking of me, nothing but me! I
like them to be<pb xml:id="fswater_1301554" n="206 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> pleasant
and pleased. And I make them so, somehow--' She shrugged her shoulders
whimsically as if to dismiss the puzzle, and went on gravely, 'And you
can't make people happy if you aren't happy yourself, you know, so
there is no use in thinking you could.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301556">It was bitter truth, but Kate was too honest to deny it. There had
always been the sense of grievance in the past, and the sense of
self-sacrifice, at least, would remain in the future.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301557">'But there are other considerations,' she began slowly. 'A man does
not set such store by--by love and marriage as a woman. It is only a
bit--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301558">'A very small bit'--put in Mrs. Gissing, with a whimsical face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301559">'A very small bit of his life,' continued Kate stolidly, 'and if my
husband gives up his profession--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301560">Mrs. Gissing interrupted her again; this time petulantly. 'I told
him it was a pity--I offered to go away anywhere. I did, indeed! And I
couldn't do more, could I? But when a man gets a notion of honour into
his head--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301561">'Honour!' interrupted Kate in her turn, 'The less said about honour
the better, surely, between you and me!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301562">The wide blue eyes looked at her doubtfully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301563">'I never can understand women like you,' said their owner. 'You
pretend not to care, and then you make so much fuss over so
little.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301564">'So little!' retorted Kate, her temper rising. 'Is it little that
my boy should have to know this about his father?--about me?--You have
no children, Mrs. Gissing! If you had you would understand the shame
better--Oh! I know about the baby and the flowers--who doesn't? But
that is nothing. It was so long ago, it died so young, you have
forgotten--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301565">She broke off before the expression on the face before her--that
face with the shadowless eyes, but with deep shadows beneath the eyes
and a nameless look of physical strain and stress upon it--and a
sudden pallor came to her own cheek.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301566">'So he hasn't told you,' came the high voice half-fretfully,
half-pitifully. 'That was very mean of him; but I thought, somehow, he
couldn't, by your coming here. Well! I suppose I
must. Mrs. Erlton--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301568">Kate stepped back from her defiantly, angrily. 'He has told me all
I need, all I care to know about this miserable business. Yes! he has!
You can see the letter if you like<pb xml:id="fswater_1301567" n="207 DAYLIGHT"/>--there it
is! I am not ashamed of it. It is a good letter, better than I thought
he could write--better than you deserve. For he says he will marry you
if I will let him! And he says he is sorry it can't be helped. But I
deny that. It can, it must, it shall be helped! And then he says it a
pity for the boy's sake; but that it does not matter so much as if it
was a girl--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301569">It was the queerest sound which broke in on those passionate
reproaches. The queerest sound. Neither a laugh nor a sob, nor a cry;
but something compounded of all three, infinitely soft, infinitely
tender.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301570">'<hi rend="italic">And the other may be</hi>,' said Alice Gissing
in a voice of smiles and tears, as she pointed to the end,of the
sentence in the letter Kate had thrust upon her. 'Poor dear! What a
way to put it! How like a man to think you could understand; and I
wonder what the old Mai <hi rend="italic">would</hi> say to its
being--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301571">What did she say? What were the frantic words which broke from the
frantic figure, its sparse grey hair showing, its shrivelled bosom
heaving unveiled, which burst into the room and flung its arms round
that little be-frilled white one as if to protect and shield it?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301572">Kate Erlton gave a half-choked, half-sobbing cry. Even this seemed
a relief from the incredible horror of what had dawned upon her,
frightening her by the wild insensate jealousy it roused--the jealousy
of motherhood.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301573">'What is it? What does she say?' she cried passionately, 'I have a
right to know!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301575">Alice Gissing looked at her with a faint wonder. 'It is nothing
about <hi rend="italic">that</hi>,' she said, and her face, though it
had whitened, showed no fear. 'It's something more important. There
has been a row in the city--the Commissioner and some other Englishmen
have been killed, and she says we are not safe. I don't quite
understand. Oh! don't be a fool, Mai!' she went on in Hindustani, 'I
won't excite myself. I never do. Don't be a fool I say!' Her foot came
down almost savagely and she turned to Kate. 'If you will wait here
for a second, Mrs. Erlton, I'll go outside with the Mai and have a
look round, and bring my husband's pistol from the other room. You had
better stay, really. I shall be back in a moment. And I daresay it's
all the old Mai's nonsense--she is such a fool about me--nowadays.'
Her<pb xml:id="fswater_1301574" n="208 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> white face, smiling
over its own certainty of coming trouble, was gone, and the door
closed, almost before Kate could say a word. Not that she had any to
say. She was too dazed to think of danger to the little figure, which
passed out into the shady back verandah perched on the city wall,
looking out into the peaceful country beyond. She was too absorbed in
what she had just realised to think of anything else. So this was what
he had meant!--and this woman with her facile nature ready to please
and be pleased with any one--this woman content to take the lowest
place--had the highest of all claims upon him. This woman who had no
right to motherhood, who did not know--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301576">God in Heaven! What was that through the stillness and the peace? A
child's pitiful scream....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301577">She was at the closed windows in an instant, peering through the
slits of the jalousies; but there was nothing to be seen save a blare
and blaze of sunlight on sun-scorched grass and sun-withered beds of
flowers. Nothing!--stay!--Christ help us! What was that? A vision of
white, and gold, and blue! White garments and white wings, golden
curls and flaming golden crest, fierce grey-blue beak and claws among
the fluttering blue ribbons--Sonny! His little feet flying and failing
fast among the flower-beds. Sonny! still holding his favourite's chain
in the unconscious grip of terror, while half-dragged, half-flying,
the wide white wings fluttered over the child's head.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301578"><hi rend="italic">'Deen! Deen! Futteh Mahomed!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301579">That was from the bird terrified, yet still gentle.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301580">'<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen! Futteh Mahomed!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301581">That was from the old man who followed fast on the child with long
lance in rest like a pig-sticker's. An old man in a faded green turban
with a spiritual relentless face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301582">Kate's fingers were at the bolts of the high French window--her
only chance of speedy exit from that closed room. Ah! would they never
yield?--and the lance was gaining on those poor little flying
feet. Every atom of motherhood in her--fierce, instinctive, animal,
fought with those unyielding bolts....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301584">What was that? Another vision of white, and gold, and blue, dashing
into the sunlight with something in a little clenched right hand,
childish itself in frills, and laces, and ribbons, but with a face as
relentless as the old man's, as<pb xml:id="fswater_1301583" n="209 DAYLIGHT"/>
spiritual. And a clear confident voice rang above those discordant
cries.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301585">'All right, Sonny! All right, dear!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301586">On it went, swift and straight in the sunlight; and then came a
pause to level the clenched right hand over the left arm coolly, and
fire. The lance wavered. It was two feet further from that soft flesh
and blood when Alice Gissing caught the child up, turned and ran--ran
for dear life to shelter.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301587">'<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen! Futteh Mahomed!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301588">The cry came after the woman and child, and over them, released by
Sonny's wild clutch at sheltering arms, the bird fluttered echoing the
cry.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301589">But one bolt was down at last, the next yielding....Ah! who was
that dressed like a native, riding like an Englishman, who leapt the
high garden fence and was over among the flower-beds where Sonny was
being chased? Was he friend or foe? No matter! since under her
vehement hands the bolt had fallen, and Kate was out in the
verandah. Too late! The flying sunlit vision of white and gold and
blue had tripped and fallen. No! not too late. The report of a
revolver rang out, and the cry of faith came only from the bird, for
the fierce relentless face was hidden among the laces, and frills, and
ribbons that hid the withered flowers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301590">But the lance? The lance whose perilous nearness had made that shot
Jim Douglas' only chance of keeping his promise? He was on his knees
on the scorched grass choking down the curse which rose as he saw a
broken shaft among the frills and ribbons, a slow stream oozing in
gushes to dye them crimson. There was another crimson spot, too, on
the shoulder showing where a bullet, after crashing through a man's
temples, had found its spent resting place. But as the Englishman
kicked away one body, and raised the other tenderly from the unhurt
child, so as not to stir that broken shaft, he wished that if death
had had to come, he might have dealt it. To his wild rage, his insane
hatred, there seemed a desecration even in that cold touch of steel
from a dark hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301592">But Alice Gissing resented nothing. She lay propped by his arms
with those wide blue eyes still wide, yet sightless, heedless of
Kate's horrified whispers, or the poor old Mai's frantic
whimper. Until suddenly a piteous little wail rose from the
half-stunned child to mingle with that ceaseless<pb xml:id="fswater_1301591" n="210 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> iteration of grief. '<hi rend="italic">Oh! meri
buchchi murgyia!</hi>' (Oh, my girlie is dead!--dead!)</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301593">It seemed to bring her back, and a smile showed on the fast-paling
face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301594">'Don't be a fool, Mai. It isn't a girl; it's a boy. Take care of
him, do, and don't be stupid. I'm all right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301595">Her voice was strong enough, and Kate looked at Jim Douglas
hopefully--she had recognised him at once, despite his dress, with a
faint dead wonder as to why things were so strange to-day. But he
could feel something oozing wet and warm over his supporting arm, and
he knew the meaning of that whitening face; so he shook his head
hopelessly, his eyes on those wide unseeing ones. She was as still, he
thought, as she had been when he held her before. Then suddenly the
eyes narrowed into sight, and looked him in the face curiously,
clearly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301596">'It's you, is it?' came the old inconsequent laugh. 'Why don't you
say Bravo!--Bravo!--Bra--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301597">The crimson rush of blood from her still-smiling lips, dyed his
hands also, as he caught her up recklessly with a swift order to the
others to follow, and ran for the house. But as he ran, clasping her
close, close, to him, his whispered bravos assailed her dead ears
passionately, and when he laid her on her bed, he paused even in the
mad tumult of his rage, his anxiety, his hope for others, to kiss the
palms of those brave hands ere he folded them decently on her breast,
and was out to fetch his horse, and return to where Kate waited for
him in the verandah, the child in her arms. Brave also; but the
certainty that he had left the flood-level of sympathy and admiration
behind him at the feet of a dead woman he had never known, was with
him even in his hurry.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301598">'I can't see any one else about as yet,' he said, as he reloaded
hastily, 'and but for that fiend--that devil of a bird hounding him
on--what did it mean?--not that it matters now'--he threw his hand out
in a gesture of impotent regret and turned to mount.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301599">Kate shivered. What, indeed, did it mean? A vague recollection was
adding to her horror. Had she driven away once from an
uncomprehensible appeal in that relentless face? when the bird--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301601">'Don't think, please,' said Jim Douglas, pausing to give her a
sharp glance. 'You will need all your nerve. The troops<pb xml:id="fswater_1301600" n="211 DAYLIGHT"/> mutinied at Meerut last night, and killed a lot of
people. They have come on here, and I don't trust the native
regiments. Go inside, and shut the door. I must reconnoitre a bit
before we start.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301602">'But my husband!' she cried, and her tone made him remember the
strangeness of finding her in that house. She looked unreliable, to
his keen eye; the bitter truth might make her rigid, callous, and in
such callousness lay their only chance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301603">'All right. He asked me to look after--her.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301604">He saw her waver, then pull herself together; but he saw also that
her clasp on Sonny tightened convulsively, and he held out his
arms.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301605">'Hand the child to me for a moment,' he said briefly, 'and call
that poor lady's ayah from her wailing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301606">The piteous whimperings from the darkened rooms within ceased
reluctantly. The old woman came with lagging step into the veranda,
but Jim Douglas called to her in the most matter-of-fact voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301607">'Here, Mai! Take your <hi rend="italic">mem's</hi> charge. She told
you to take care of the boy, remember.' The tear-dim doubtful eyes
looked at him half-resentfully, as he went on coolly. 'Now, Sonny, go
to your ayah, and be a good boy. Hold out your arms to old ayah, who
has had ever so many Sonnys--haven't you, ayah.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301608">The child, glad to escape from the prancing horse, the purposely
rough arms, held out its little dimpled hands. They seemed to draw the
hesitating old feet, step by step, till with a sudden fierce snatch, a
wild embrace, the old arms closed round the child with a croon of
content.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301609">Jim Douglas breathed more freely. 'Now, Mrs. Erlton;' he said, 'I
can't make you promise to leave Sonny there; but he is safer with her
than he could be with you. She must have friends in the city. You
haven't <hi rend="italic">one</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301611">He was off as he spoke, leaving her to that knowledge. Not a
friend! No! not one. Still, he need not have told her so, she thought
proudly, as she passed in and closed the doors as she had been bidden
to do. But he had succeeded. A certain fierce dull resistance bad
replaced her emotion. So while the ayah, still carrying Sonny,
returned to her dead mistress. Kate remained in the drawing-room,
feeling stunned; too stunned to think of anything save those last
words. Not a friend! Not one, saving a few cringing shop-keepers,
in<pb xml:id="fswater_1301610" n="212 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> all, that wide city to
whom she had ever spoken a word? Whose fault was that! Whose fault was
it that she had not understood that appeal?--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301612">A rattle of musketry quite close at hand roused her from apathy
into fear for the child, and she passed rapidly into the next room. It
was empty, save for that figure on the bed. The ayah with her charge
had gone, closing the doors behind her; to her friends no doubt. But
she, Kate Erlton, had none. The renewed rattle of musketry sent her to
peer through the jalousies; but she could see nothing. The sound
seemed to come from the open space by the church, but gardens lay
between her and that, blocking the view. Still it was quite close;
seemed closer than it had been. No doubt it would come closer and
closer till it found her waiting there, without a friend. Well! Since
she was not even capable of saving Sonny, she could at least do what
she was told--she could at least die alone.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301613">No! not quite alone! She turned back to the bed and looked down on
the slender figure lying there as if asleep--for the ayah's vain hopes
of lingering life had left the face unstained, and the folded hands
hid the crimson below them. Asleep, not dead; for the face had no look
of rest. It was the face of one who dreams still of the stress and
strain of coming life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301614">So this was to be her companion in death; this woman who had done
her the greatest wrong--What wrong? The question came dully. What
wrong had she done to one who refused to admit the claims or rights of
passion? What had she stolen, this woman who had not cared at all!
Whose mind had been unsullied utterly. Only motherhood; and that was
given to saint and sinner alike; and given rightly here, for those
little hands were brave mother-hands. Kate put out hers softly and
touched them. Still warm,, still life-like, their companionship
thrilled her through and through. With a faint sob,, she sank on her
knees beside the bed and laid her cheek on them. Let death come and
find her there! Let the finish of the race, which was the win and the
lose--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301615">'Mrs. Erlton! quick, please!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301616">Jim Douglas' voice calling to her from outside roused her from a
sort of apathy into sudden desire for life; she was out in the
verandah in a second.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301617" n="213 DAYLIGHT"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301618">'The game's up,' he said, scarcely able to speak from
breathlessness, and his horse was in a white lather. 'I had to see to
the Seymours first, and now there's only one chance I can think
of--desperate at that. Quick, your foot on mine--so--from the
step--Now your hand. One! two! three! That's right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301619">He had her on the saddle before him and was off through the gardens
citywards at a gallop. 'The 54th came down from the cantonments all
right,' he went on rapidly, 'but shot their officers at the
church--the city scoundrels are killing and looting all about, but the
main-guard is closed and safe as yet. I got Mrs. Seymour there. I'll
get you if I can. I'm going to ride through the thick of the devils
now with you as my prisoner--do you see?--there at the turn. I'll
hark back down the road--it's the only chance of getting through. Slip
down a bit across the saddle bow. Don't be afraid. I'll hold as long
as I can. Now scream--scream like the devil. No! let your arms slack
as if you'd fainted--people won't look so much--that's better--that's
capital--now--ready!'...</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301621">He swerved his horse with a dig of the spur and made for the crowd
which lay between him and safety. The words, describing the rape of
the Sabine women, over the construing of which he remembered being
birched at school recurred to him, as such idle thoughts will at such
times, as he hitched his hand tighter on Kate's dress and scattered
the first group with a coarse jest or two. Thank Heaven! she would not
understand these, his only weapons, since cold steel could not be
used, till it had to be used to <hi rend="italic">prevent</hi> her understanding; Thank
Heaven too! he could use both weapons fairly. So, he dug in the spurs
again and answered the crowd in its own kind, recklessly; a laugh, an
oath, once or twice a blow with the flat of his sword. And Kate, with
slack arms and closed eyes, lay and listened--listened to a sharper,
angrier voice, a quick, clash of steel, a shout of half-doubtful,
half-pleased derision from those near, a jest, provoking a roar of
merriment for one who meant to hold his own, in love and war. Then
there was a sudden bound of the horse; a faint slackening of that iron
grip on her waist belt, The worst of the stream was past; another
moment-and they were in a quiet street, another and they had turned at
right-angles down a secluded alley where Jim Douglas paused to pass
his right hand, still holding his sword, under Kate's head and bid her
lean against him<pb xml:id="fswater_1301620" n="214 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> more
comfortably. The rest was easy. He would take her out by the Moree
gate--the alleys to it would be almost deserted--so, outside the
walls, to the rear of the Kashmir gate. They were already twisting and
turning through the narrow lanes as he told her this. Then, with a
rush and a whoop, he made for the gate, and the next moment they had
the open country, the world, before them. How still and peaceful it
lay in the sunshine! But the main-guard was the nearest, safest
shelter, and so the galloping hoofs sped down the tree-set road along
which Kate generally took her evening drive.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301622">'And you?' she asked hurriedly as he set her down at the moat and
bade her run for the wicket and knock, while he kept the
drawbridge.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301623">He shook his head. 'The reliefs from Meerut must be in soon. If
they started at dawn, in an hour. Besides I'm off to the palace to see
what has really happened; information's everything.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301624">She saw him turn, with a wave of his sword for farewell, as the
wicket was opened cautiously, and then make for the Moree gate once
more. As he rode he told himself there should be no further cause for
anxiety on her account. De Tessier's guns were in the mainguard now,
and reinforcements of the loyal 74th. They could hold their own easily
till the Meerut people smashed up the palace. They could not be long
now, and the city had not risen as yet. The bigger bazaars through
which he cantered were almost deserted--every one had gone home. But
at the entrance to an alley a group of boys clustered, and one ran out
to him crying, 'Khân-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>! What's the
matter? Folk say people are being killed, but we want to go to
school.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301625">'Don't,' said Jim Douglas as he passed on. He had seen the
schoolmaster, stripped naked, lying on his back in the broad daylight
as he galloped along the college road with Kate over his
saddle-bow.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301626">'<hi rend="italic">Ari</hi>, brothers,' reported the spokesman. 'He
said "don't" but he can know naught. He comes from outside. And we
shall lose places in class if we stop, and others go.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301627">So in the cheerful daylight the school-boys discussed the problem,
school or no school; the Great Revolt had got no further than
that--<hi rend="italic">as yet</hi>.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301628">Bnt there was no cloud of dust upon the Meerut road, though
straining eyes thought they saw one more than once.</p></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1301629" n="215 NOON"/><div xml:id="fswater_0304" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV<lb/>NOON</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301630">BUT if the schoolmaster of one school lay dead in the sunlight
there was another, well able to teach a useful lesson, left alive; and
his school remains for all time as a place where men may learn what
men can do.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301631">For about three hundred yards from the deserted college, about six
from the main-guard of the Kashmir gate stood the magazine, to which
the two young Englishmen, followed by a burlier one, had walked back
quietly after one of them had remarked that he could hold his own;
since there were gates to be barred, four walls to be seen to, and
various other preparations to be made before the nine men who formed
the garrison could be certain of thus holding their own. And their own
meant much to others; for with the stores and the munitions of war
safe the city might rise, but it would be unarmed; but with <hi rend="italic">them</hi> at
the mercy of the rabble, every pitiful pillager could become a recruit
to the disloyal regiments.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301632">'The mine's about finished now, sir,' said Conductor Buckley,
saluting gravely as he looked critically down a line ending in the
powder magazine. 'And, askin' your pardon, sir, mightn't it be as well
to settle a signal beforehand, sir; in case it's wanted? And, if you
have no objection, sir, here's Sergeant Scully here, sir, saying he
would look on it as a kind favour--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301633">A man with a spade glanced up a trifle anxiously for the answer as
he went on with his work.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301634">'All right! Scully shall fire it. If you finish it there in the
middle by that little lemon tree, we shan't forget the exact
spot. Scully must see to having the portfire ready for himself. I'll
give the word to you, as your gun will be near mine, and you can pass
it on by raising your cap. That will do, I think.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301635">'Nicely, sir,' said Conductor Buckley, saluting again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301636">'I wish we had one more man,' remarked the Head-of-the-nine, as he
paused in passing a gun to look to something in its gear with swift
professional eye. 'I don't quite see how the nine of us are to work
the ten guns.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301637" n="216 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301638">'Oh! we'll manage somehow,' said his second in command, 'the native
establishment--perhaps--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301639">George Willoughby, the Head-of-the-nine, looked at the sullen group
of dark faces lounging, distrustfully within those barred doors, and
his own face grew stern. Well, if they would not work, they should at
least stay and look on--stay till the end. Then he took out his
watch.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301640">'Twelve! The Meerut troops will be in soon--if they started at
dawn--' there was the finest inflection of scorn in his voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301641">'They must have started,' began his companion. But the tall figure
with the grave young face was straining its eyes from the bastion they
were passing; it gave upon the Bridge-of-boats and the lessening white
streak of road. He was looking for a cloud of dust upon it; but there
was none.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301642">'I hope so,' he remarked as he went on. He gave a half-involuntary
glance back, however, to the stunted lemon bush. There was a black
streak by it, which might be relied upon to give aid at dawn, or dusk,
or noon; high noon as it was now.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301643">The chime of it echoed methodically as ever from the mainguard,
making a cheerful young voice in the officer's room say, 'Well! the
enemy is passing, anyhow. The reliefs can't be long--if they started
at dawn.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301645">'If they had started when they ought to have started, they would
have been here hours ago,' said an older man, almost petulantly, as he
rose and wandered to the door, to stand looking out on the baking
court where his men--the two companies of the 54th, who had come down
under his charge after these under Colonel Ripley had shot down their
officers by the church--were lounging about sullenly. These men might
have shot him, also, but for the timely arrival of the two guns; might
have shot at him, even now, but for those loyal 74th overawing
them. He turned and looked at some of the latter with a sort of
envy. These men had come forward in a body when the regiment was
called upon by its commandant to give honest volunteers to keep order
in the city. What had they had, which his men had lacked? Nothing that
he knew of. And then, inevitably, he thought of his six murdered
friends and comrades, officers apparently as popular as he, whose
bodies were lying in the next room waiting for a cart to remove them
to the Ridge; for even Major Paterson saddened, depressed as he was,
looked forward to decent sepul<pb xml:id="fswater_1301644" n="217 NOON"/>ture for his
comrades by-and-by when the Meerut troops should arrive. And the
half-dozen or more of women upstairs were comforting each other with
the same hope, and crushing down the cry that it seemed an eternity,
already, since they had waited for that little cloud of dust upon the
Meerut road--but for the hope of which they might have gone
Meerutwards themselves; for the country was peaceful.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301646">Even in Duryagunj, though by noon it was a charnel-house, the score
or so of men who kept cowards at bay in a miserable store-house
comforted themselves with the same thought; and women with the long
languid eyes of one race, looked out of them with the temper and fire
of the other, saying in soft staccato voices--'It will not be long
now. They will be here soon, for they would start at dawn.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301647">'They will some soon,' said a young telegraph clerk coolly, as he
stood by his instrument hoping for a welcome <hi rend="italic">kling</hi> of the bell; and sending, finally, that
bulletin northwards which ended with the reluctant admission 'we must
shut up.' Must indeed; seeing that some ruffians rushed in and sabred
him with his hands still on the levers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301648">'They will be here soon,' agreed the compositors of the <hi rend="italic">Delhi Gazette</hi> as they worked at the strangest piece
of printing the world is ever likely to see. That famous EXtra, wedged
in between English section news, which told in bald journalese of a
crisis, which became the crisis of their own lives before the whole
edition was sent out.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301649">But down in the palace Zeenut Maihl had been watching that white
streak of road also, and as the hours passed, her wild impatience
would let her watch it no longer. She paced up and down the queen's
bastion like a caged tigress, leaving Hafzân to take her place
at the lattice. No sign of an avenging army yet! Then the troopers'
tale must be true! The hour of decisive action had come, it was
slipping past, the king was in the hands of Ahsan-Oolah and Elahi
Buksh--whose face was set both ways like the physician's. And she,
helpless, half in disgrace, caged, veiled, screened, unable to lay
hands on any one!--Oh! why was she not a man?. Why had she not a man
to deal with? Her henna-stained nails bit into her palms as she
clenched her hands, then in sheer childish passion tore off her
hampering veil and rolling it into a ball flung it at the head of a
drowsy eunuch in the outside arcade--the nearest thing to a man within
her reach.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301650" n="218 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301651">'No sign yet, Hafzân?' she asked fiercely.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301652">'No sign, my Queen,' replied Hafzân with an odd derisive
smile. If they did not come now, thought this woman with her warped
nature, they would come later on; come and put a rope round the necks
of men who had laid violent hands on women.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301653">'Then I stop here no longer,' cried Zeenut Maihl recklessly 'I must
see somewhat of it or die. Quick, girls, my dhooli, I will go back to
my own rooms. 'Twill at least bear me through the crowd, and the
jogging will keep the blood from tingling from very stillness.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301654">So through the tawdry, dirty, musky curtains a woman's fierce eye
watched the crowd hungrily, as the dhooli swung through it. It was a
fierce crowd in its way, but it lacked cohesion. Like the world
without those four rose-red walls, it was waiting for a Master. And
the man who should have been master was taking cooling draughts, and
composing couplets, so her spies brought word. There was no hope from
him till she could lure him back from his vexation, and put some of
her own energy into him. Who next was there, likely to do her bidding?
Her eye, taking in all the strangeness of the scene--troopers stabling
their horses in the colonnades--sepoys bivouacking under the
trees--courtiers hurrying up and down the private steps, found none in
all that crowd of place-hunters, boasters, enthusiasts, whom she could
trust. The King's eldest son Mirza Moghul was the fiercest-tempered of
them all, the only one whom she feared in any way; perhaps if she
could get hold of him--?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301655">As her dhooli swayed up the steps he was standing on them talking
to Mirza Khair Sultan. She could have put out her hand and touched
him; but even she did not dare convention enough for
that. Nevertheless, the sight of him determined her. If the King did
not come back to her by noon, she must lure the Mirza to her side.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301656">'Thou art a fool <hi rend="italic">Pir-jee</hi>' she said
petulantly to Hussan Askuri who, as father confessor, had entrance to
the women's rooms, and was awaiting her. 'Thou hast no grip on the
King when I am absent. Can'st not even drive that slithering physician
from his side?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301657">'Cooling draughts, seest thou <hi rend="italic">Pir-jee</hi>,' put
in Hafzân maliciously, 'have tangible effects. Thy
dreams--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301658">'Peace, woman!' interrupted the Queen sternly, 'tis no time for
jesting. Where sits the King now?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301659" n="219 NOON"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301660">'In the river balcony, Ornament-of-palaces,' replied Fâtma
glibly, 'where he is not to be disturbed these two hours, so the
physician says, lest the cooling draught--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301661">The Queen stamped her foot in sheer impotent rage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301662">'I must see some one! And Jewan Bukht my son? why hath he not
answered my summons?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301663">'His Highness,' put in Hafzân gravely, 'was, as I came by just now,
quarrelling in his cups with his nephew, the princely Abool-Bukr,
regarding the Inspectorship-of-Cavalry; which office both desire--a
weighty matter--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301664">'Peace! she-devil!' almost screamed the Queen. 'Can I not see, can
I not hear for myself, that thy sharp wits must for ever drag the
rotten heart to light? thou wilt go too far, some day, Hafzân,
and then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301665">'The Queen will have to find another scribe,' replied Hafzân
meekly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301666">Zeenut Maihl glared at her, then rolled round into her cushions as
if she were in actual physical pain. And hark! from the Lahore gate,
as if nothing had happened, came the chime of noon. Noon! and nothing
done. She sat up suddenly and signed to Hafzân for pen and
ink. She would wait no longer for the King; she would at least try the
Mirza.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301667">'<hi rend="italic">This, to the most illustrious the Mirza Moghul,
Heir-Apparent by right to the throne of Timoor</hi>,'<ref target="#fswatern219">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern219" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">There is no actual warranty for this letter; but it is
certain that Zeenut Maihl made use of the signet several times.</note>
she dictated firmly, and Hafzân looked up startled. 'Write on,
fool,' she continued, 'hast never written lies before? <hi rend="italic">After salutation the Begum Zeenut Maihl--</hi>' the
humbler title came from her lips in a tone which boded ill for the
recipient of the letter if he fell into the toils--'<hi rend="italic">seeing that in this hour of importance the King is sick,
and by order of physicians not to be disturbed, would know if the
Mirza, being by natural right the King's viceregent, desires the
private seal to any orders necessary for peace and protection. Such
signet being in the hands of the Queen--</hi>' nay not that, I was
forgetting--'<hi rend="italic">the Begum.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301669">She gave an angry laugh as she lay back among her cushions and bid
them send the letter forthwith. That should make him nibble. Not that
she had the signet--the King kept that on his own finger; but if the
Mirza came on pretence, or rather in hopes of getting it?--Why! then;
if the proper order was given, and if she could ensure the aid<pb xml:id="fswater_1301668" n="220 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> of men to carry out her
schemes, the signet should be got at somehow. The King was old and
frail; the storm and stress might well kill him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301670">So her thoughts ranged from one plot to another as she waited for
an answer. If this lure succeeded, she would but use the Heir-Apparent
for a time. What use was there in plotting for him? He could die, as
other heirs had died; and then the only person likely to put a spoke
in her wheel was Abool-Bukr. He was teaching his young uncle the first
pleasures of manhood, and might find it convenient to influence the
boy against her. It would be well therefore to get hold of him
also. That was not a hard task, and she sat up again without a
moment's hesitation, and signed once more to Hafzân.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301671">'Thy best flourishes,' she said with an evil sneer, 'for it goes to
a rare scholar; to a fool for all that, who would have folk think
nephews visit their aunts from duty! '<hi rend="italic">This to
Newâsi loving and beloved, greeting. Consequent on the
disturbances, the princely nephew Abool-Bukr lieth senseless here in
the palace.</hi>'--Stare not, fool! senseless drunk he is by this time
I warrant--'<hi rend="italic">Those who have seen him think ill of
him.</hi>'--here she broke off into malicious enjoyment of her own
wit--'Ay! and those who have but heard of him also! '<hi rend="italic">The course of events, however, being in the hands of
heaven will be duly reported.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301672">She coiled herself up again on the cushions, an insignificant
square homely figure draped in worn brocade and laden with tarnished
jewelry--ill-matched strings of pearls, flawed emeralds, diamonds
without sparkle. Yet not without a certain dignity, a certain symmetry
of purpose, harmonising with the arched and frescoed room in which she
lay; a room beautiful in design and decoration, yet dirty,
comfortless, almost squalid.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301673">'Nay! not my, signature,' she yawned. 'I am too old a foe of the
scholars; but a smudge o' the thumb will do. If I know aught of aunts
and nephews, she will be too much flustered by the news to look at
seals. And have word sent to the Delhi gate that the Princess
Farkhoonda be admitted, but goes not forth again.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301674">Her hard voice ceased; there was no sound in the room save that
strange hum from the gardens outside which at this hour of the day
were generally wrapped in sun-drugged slumbers.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301675" n="221 NOON"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301676">But the world beyond, towards which the old king's lustreless eyes
looked as he lay on the river balcony, was sleepy, sun-drugged as
ever. Through the tracery-set arches showed yellow stretches of sand
and curving river, with tussocks of tall tiger-grass hiding the
slender stems of the palm-trees which shot up here and there into the
blue sky-blue with the yellow glaze upon it which comes from sheer
sunlight. A row of <hi rend="italic">saringhi</hi> players squatted in
the room behind the balcony, thrumming softly, so as to hide that
strange hum of life which reached even here. For the King was writing
a couplet and was in difficulties with a rhyme for <hi rend="italic">cartouche</hi> (cartridge); since he was a stickler for
form, holding that the keynote of the lines should jingle. And this
couplet was to epitomise the situation on the other side of the <hi rend="italic">saringhies. Cartouche? Cartouche?</hi> Suddenly he sat
up.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301677">'Quick! send for Hussar Askuri; or stay!' he hesitated for an
instant. Hussan Askuri would be with the Queen, and no one ever
admired his couplets as she did. How many hours was it since he had
seen her? And what was the use of making couplets, if you were denied
their just meed of praise? 'Stay,' he repeated, 'I will go
myself.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301678">It was a relief to feel himself on the way back to be led by the
nose, and as they helped him across the intervening courtyard he kept
repeating his treasure, imagining her face when she heard it.</p><q><l rend="italic">'Kuchch Chil-i-Room nahin
kya, ya Shah-i-Roos, nahin</l><l rend="italic">Jo Kuchch kya na sara se, so cartouche
ne.'</l></q><p xml:id="fswater_1301679">A couplet, which, lingering still in the mouths of the people,
warrants the old poetaster's conceit of it, and--dog-anglicised--runs
thus--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301680"><q><l>'Nor Czar nor Sultan made the conquest easy,</l><l>The only weapon was a cartridge greasy.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301681">'The Queen? Where is the Queen?' fumed the old man, when he found
an empty room instead of instant flattery; for he was after all, the
Great Moghul.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301683">'She prays for the King's recovery,' said Fâtma readily. 'I
will inform her that her prayer is granted.' But as she passed on her
errand, she winked at a companion, who hid her giggle in her veil; for
Grand Turk or not, the women hold all the trump cards in seclusion. So
how was the old<pb xml:id="fswater_1301682" n="222 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> man to know
that the one who came in radiant with exaggerated delight at his
return, had been interviewing his eldest son behind decorous screens,
and that she was thanking heaven piously for having sent him back to
her apron-string in the very nick of time; sent him, and Hussan
Askuri, and pen and ink, within reach of her quick wit.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301684">'That is the best couplet my lord has done,' she said
superbly. 'That must be signed and sealed.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301685">So must a paper be, which lay concealed in her bosom. And as she
spoke she drew the signet ring lovingly, playfully from the King's
finger and walked over to where the scribe sat crouched on the
floor.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301686">'Ink it well, <hi rend="italic">Pir-jee</hi>,' she said, keeping
her back to the King, 'the impression must be as immortal as the
verse.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301687">Despite the warning, a very keen ear might have detected a double
sound, as if the seal had needed a second pressure. That was all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301688">So it came about that, half an hour or so afterwards, the
Head-of-the-nine at the magazine was looking contemptuously at a paper
brought by the Palace Guards, and passed under the door, ordering its
instant opening. George Willoughby laughed; but some of the Eight
dashed people's impudence and cursed their cheek! Yet, after the
laugh, the Head-ofthe-nine walked over, yet another time, to that
river bastion to look down at that white streak of road. How many
times he had looked already, Heaven knows; but his grave face had
grown graver, though it brightened again after a glance at the lemon
bush. The black streak there would not fail them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301689">'In the King's name open!' The demand came from Mirza Moghul
himself this time, for the Palace was without arms, without
ammunition; and if they were to defend it according to the Queen's
idea, against all comers till there was time for other regiments to
rebel, this matter of the magazine was important. Abool-Bukr was with
him, half-drunk, wholly incapable, but full of valour; for a scout
sent by the Queen had returned with news that no English soldier was
within ten miles of Delhi, and within the last half hour an ominous
word had begun to pass from lip to lip in the city.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301690">'<hi rend="italic">Helpless!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301692">The masters were <hi rend="italic">helpless</hi>. Past two o'clock
and not a blow in revenge! <hi rend="italic">Helpless!</hi> The word
made cowards brave, and brave folk cowards. And many who had spent the
long<pb xml:id="fswater_1301691" n="223 NOON"/> hours in peeping from their closed doors at
each fresh clatter in the street, hoping it was the master, looked at
each other with startled eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301693"><hi rend="italic">Helpless! Helpless!</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301694">The echo of the thought reached the main-guard, still in touch with
the outside world, whence, as the day dragged by, fresh tidings of
danger drifted down from the Ridge where men, women, and children lay
huddled helplessly in the Flagstaff Tower, watching the white streak
of road. It seems like a bad dream, that hopeless, paralysing strain
of the eyes for a cloud of dust.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301695">But the echo won no way into the magazine, for the simple reason
that it knew it was not helpless. It could hold its own.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301696">'Shoot that man Kureem Buksh, please, Forrest, if he comes
bothering round the gate again. He is really very annoying. I have
told him several times to keep back; so it is no use his trying to
give information to the people outside.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301697">For the Head-of-the-nine was very courteous. 'Scaling ladders?' he
echoed, when a native superintendent told him that the princes,
finding him obdurate, had gone to send some down from the palace. 'Oh!
by all means let them scale if they like.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301698">Some of the Eight, hearing the reply, smiled grimly. By all means
let the flies walk into the parlour; for if that straight streak of
road was really going to remain empty, the fuller the four square
walls round the lemon bush could be, the better.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301700">'That's them, sir,' said one of the Eight cheerfully, as a grating
noise rose above the hum outside. 'That's the grapnels.' And as he
turned to his particular gun of the ten, he told himself that he would
nick the first head or two with his rifle and keep the grape for the
bunches. So he smiled at his own little joke and waited. All the Nine
waited, each to a gun, and of course there was one gun over, but, as
the Head of them had said, that could not be helped. And so the
rifle-triggers clicked, and the stocks came up to the shoulders; and
then?--then there was a sort of laugh, and some one said under his
breath, 'Well, I'm blowed!' And his mind went back to the streets of
London, and he wondered how many years it was since he had seen a
lamplighter. For up ropes and poles, on roofs and outhouses,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301699" n="224 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> somehow, clinging like
limpets, running like squirrels along the top of the wall, upsetting
the besiegers, monopolising the ladders, was a rush, not of attack but
of escape! Let what fool who liked scale the wall and come into the
parlour of the Nine, those who knew the secret of the lemon-bush were
off. No safety there beside the Nine! No life-insurance possible while
that lay ready to their hand!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301701">Would he ever see a lamplighter again? The trivial thought was with
the bearded man who stood by his gun, the real self in him, hidden
behind the reserve of courage, asking other questions too, as he
waited for the upward rush of fugitives to change into a downward rush
of foes worthy of good powder and shot.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301702">It came at last--and the grape came too, mowing the intruders down
in bunches. And these were no mere rabble of the city. They were the
pick of the trained mutineers swarming over the wall to stand on the
outhouse roofs and fire at the Nine; and so, pressed in gradually from
behind, coming nearer and nearer, dropping to the ground in solid
ranks, firing in platoons; thus by degrees hemming in the Nine,
hemming in the lemon-bush.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301703">But the Nine were busy with the guns. They had to be served
quickly, and that left no time for thought. Then the smoke, and the
flashes, and the yells, and the curses, filled up the rest of the
world for the present.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301704">'This is the last round, I'm afraid, sir; we shan't have time for
another,' said a warning voice from the Nine, and the Head of them
looked round quietly. The intruders were not more than forty yards now
from the guns; there was barely time, certainly, unless they had had
that other man! So he nodded, and the last round pealed out as
recklessly, as defiantly, as if there had been a hundred to
follow,--and a hundred thousand--a hundred million. But one of the
gunners threw down his fuse ere his gun recoiled, and ran in lightly
towards the lemon-tree, so as to be ready for the favour he had
begged.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301705">'We're about full up, sir,' came the warning voice again, as the
rest of the Nine fell back amid a desultory rattle of small arms. The
tinkle of the last church bell, as it were, warning folk to hurry
up,--a last invitation to walk into the parlour of the Nine.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301706">'We're about full up, sir,' came that one voice.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301707" n="225 SUNSET"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301708">'Wait half a second,' came another, as the Head-of-the-nine ran to
the river bastion for a last look down the white streak for that cloud
of dust.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301709">How sunny it was!--How clear!--How still!--that world beyond the
smoke, beyond the flashes, beyond the deafening yells and curses. He
gave one look at it, one short look--only one--then turned to face his
own world, the world he had to keep. Full up indeed! No pyrotechnist
could hope for better audience in so small a place.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301710">'Now, if you please!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301711">Some one in the thick of the smoke and the flashes, the yells and
the curses, heard and raised his cap--a last salute, as it were, to
the school and the schoolmaster--a final dismissal to the scholars, a
thousand of them or so, about to finish their lesson of what men can
do to hold their own. And some one else, standing beside the
lemon-bush, bent over that faithful black streak, then ran for dear
life from the hissing of that snake of fire flashing to the powder
magazine.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301712">A faint sob, a whispering gasp of horror, came from the thousand
and odd; but above it came a roar, a rush, a rending. A little puff of
white smoke went skywards first, and then slowly, majestically, a
great cloud of rose-red dust grew above the ruins, to hang--a corona
glittering in the slant sunbeams--over the school, the schoolmasters,
and the scholars.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301713">It hung there for hours. To those who know the story it seems to
hang there still,--a bloody pall for the many; for the Nine, a crown
indeed.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0305" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V<lb/>SUNSET</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301714">The question sprung to every lip; yet all knew the answer. The
magazine had saved itself.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301716">But in the main-guard, not six hundred yards off, where the very
ground rocked and the walls shook, the men and women pent up since
noon, looked at each other when the<pb xml:id="fswater_1301715" n="226 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> first shock was over, feeling that here was the end of
inaction. Here was a distinct, definite challenge to Fate, and what
would come of it? It was now close on four o'clock; the day was over,
the darkness at hand. What would it bring them? If Meerut with its two
thousand was so sore bested that it could not spare one man to Delhi,
what could they, a mere handful, hope for--save annihilation?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301717">Yet even Mrs. Seymour only clasped her baby closer, and said
nothing; for there was no lack of courage anywhere. And Kate, with
another child in her arms, paused as she laid it down, asleep at last,
upon an officer's coat, to feel a certain relief. If <hi rend="italic">they</hi> were to fare thus, that bitter self-reproach
and agonising doubt for vanished Sonny was unavailing; his chance
might well be better than theirs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301719">Well indeed! pent up as they were cheek-by-jowl with four hundred
unstable sepoys, and with the ominously-rising hum of the unstable
city on their unprotected rear. Up on the Flagstaff Tower crowning the
extreme northern end of the Ridge, away from this hum, where Brigadier
Graves had gathered together the remaining women and children, so as
to guard them as best he could with such troops as he had
remaining--many of them too unstable to be trusted citywards--they
were in better plight. For they had the open country round them; a
country where folk could still go and come with fair chance of safety,
since even the predatory tribes, always ready to take advantage of
disorder, were still waiting to see what master the day would bring
forth. And they had also the knowledge that something was being done,
that they were not absolutely passive in the hands of Fate, after
Dr. Batson started in disguise to summon that aid from Meerut which
would not come of itself. Above all, they had the decision, they had
the power to act; while down in the main-guard they could but obey
orders. Not that the Flagstaff Tower did much with this advantage; for
it was paralysed by that straining of the eyes for a cloud of dust
upon the Meerut road which was the damnation of Delhi. Yet even here
that decisive roar, that corona of red dust brightening every instant
as the sun dipped to the horizon, brought the conviction that
something must be done at last. But what? Hampered by women and
children, what could they do? If, earlier in the day, they had sent
all the noncombatants off towards Kurnal or Meerut, with as many<pb xml:id="fswater_1301718" n="227 SUNSET"/> faithful sepoys as they could spare, arming
everybody from the arsenal down by the river, they would have been
free to make some forlorn hope--free, for instance, to go down <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi> to the main-guard and hold it, if they
could. That, even now, was what one man thought best, who, seven miles
out from Delhi--returning from a reconnaissance of his own to see if
help were on the way--saw that little puff of smoke, heard the roar,
and watched the red corona grow to brightness.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301720">But on the Ridge, men thought differently. The claims of those
patient women and children seemed paramount, and so it was decided to
get back the guns from the main-guard as a first step towards
entrenching themselves for the night at the Tower. The men in the
main-guard, however, looked at each other in doubt when the order
reached them. Was the garrison going to be withdrawn altogether,
leaving merely a forlorn hope to keep the gate closed as long as
possible against the outburst of rabble, to whom it would be the
natural and shortest route to cantonments? If so, surely it would have
been better to send the women away first? Still the orders were clear,
and so the gate was set wide and the guns rumbled over the drawbridge
under escort of a guard of the 38th. That, at any rate, was good
riddance of bad rubbish--though the wisdom of sending the guns in such
charge was doubtful; yet how could the little garrison have afforded
to give up even a single man of the still loyal 74th?--a company of
whom had actually followed their captain to the ruins of the magazine
to see if they could do anything, and returned, without a defaulter,
to say that all was confusion--the dead lying about in hundreds, the
enemy nowhere.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301721">'How did the men behave, Gordon?' asked their commandant anxiously,
getting his captain into a quiet corner. And the two men, both beloved
of their regiment, both believing in it, both with a fierce wild hope
in their hearts that such belief would be justified, looked into each
other's faces for a moment in silence. There was a shadowing branch of
veem overhead as they stood in the sunlight. A squirrel upon it was
chippering at the glitter of their buckles; a kite overhead was
watching the squirrel.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301722">'I think they hesitated, sir,' said Captain Gordon quietly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301724">Major Abbott turned hastily, and looked through the open gate, past
the lumbering guns, to the open country lying peaceful, absolutely
peaceful, beyond. If he could only have<pb xml:id="fswater_1301723" n="228 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> got his men there--away front the disloyalty of the 38th
guard, the sullen silence of the 54th--if he could only have given
them something to do! If he could only have said 'Follow me!' they
would have followed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301725">And Kate Erlton, who weary of the deadly inaction in the room
above, had drifted down to the courtyard, stood close to the archway
looking through it also, thinking, not for the first time that weary
day, of Alice Gissing's swift, heroic death with envy. It was
something to die so that brave men turned away without a word when
they heard of it. But as she thought this, the look on young
Mainwaring's face as he stood with others listening to her story, came
back to her. It had haunted her all day, and more than once she had
sought him out, not for condolence--he was beyond that--but for a
trivial word or two; just a human word or two to show him remembered
by the living. And now the impulse came to her again, and she drifted
back--for there was no hurry in that deadly, deadly inaction--to find
him leaning listlessly against a wall digging holes in the dry dust
idly with the point of his drawn sword for want of something better
whereon to use it. Such a young face, she thought, to be so old in its
chill anger and despair. She went over to him swiftly, her reserve
gone, and laid her hand upon his, holding the sword.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301726">'Don't fret so, dear boy,' she said, and the fine curves of her
mouth quivered. 'She is at peace.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301727">He looked at her in a blaze of fierce reproach. 'At peace! How dare
you say so! How dare you think so--when she lies--there.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301728">He paused, impotent for speech before his unbridled hatred, then
strode away indignantly from her pity, her consolation. And as she
looked after him her own gentler nature was conscious of a pride,
almost a pleasure in the thought of the revenge which would surely be
taken sooner or later, by such as he, for every woman, every child
killed, wounded--even touched. She was conscious of it, even though
she stood aghast before a vision of the years stretching away into a
æon of division and mutual hate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301730">A fresh stir at the gate roused her; a quick stir among a group of
senior officers, recruited now by two juniors who had earned their
right to have their say in any council of war. These were two
artillery subalterns begrimed from head to<pb xml:id="fswater_1301729" n="229 SUNSET"/>
foot, deafened, disfigured, hardly believing in their own safety as
yet; looking at each other queerly, wondering if indeed they could be
the Head-of-the-nine and his second in command, escaped by a miracle
through the sally port in the outer wall of the magazine, and so come
back by the drawbridge, as Kate Erlton had come, to join the refugees
in the main-guard. Was it possible? And--and--what would the world
say? That thought must have been in their minds. And, no doubt, a vain
regret that they were under orders now, as they listened while Major
Abbott read out those just received from cantonments. Briefly to take
back the whole of the loyal 74th and leave the post to the 38th and
the 54th--about a hundred and fifty openly disloyal men.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301731">A sort of stunned silence fell on the little group, till Major
Paterson of the 54th said quietly, officially, to Major Abbott. 'If
you leave, sir, I shall have to abandon the post; I could not possibly
hold it. Some of my men who have returned to the colours here might
possibly fight were we to stick together. But with retreat, and the
example of the 38th before them, they would not. I have, or I should
have, lives in my charge when you are gone, and I warn you that I must
use my own discretion in doing the best I can to protect them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301732">'Paterson is right, Abbott,' put in the civil officer, who had
stuck to his charge of the Treasury all day, and repelled the only
attack made by the enemy during all those long hours. 'If I am to do
any good, I must have men who will fight. I don't trust the 54th; and
the 38th are clearly just biding their time. This retreat might have
done six hours ago--might do now if it were general; but I doubt
it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301733">'Anyhow,' put in another voice, 'if the 74th are to go, they should
take the women with them--they couldn't fare worse than they are sure
to do here. I don't think the Brigadier can realise--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301734">'Couldn't you refer it?' asked some one; but the Major shook his
head. The orders were clear--no doubt there was good cause for
them--anyhow they must be obeyed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301735">'Then as civil officer in charge of the Government Treasury, I ask
for quarter-of-an-hour's law. If by then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301737">The eager voice paused. Whether the owner thought once more of that
expected cloud of dust, or whether he meant to gallop to cantonments
in hope of getting the order rescinded is doubtful. Whether he went or
stayed doubtful also. But<pb xml:id="fswater_1301736" n="230 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
the fifteen minutes of respite were given, during which the
preparations for departure went on, the men of the 38th aiding in them
with a new alacrity. Their time had come. Only a few minutes now
before the last fear of a hand-to-hand fight would be over, the last
chance of the master turning and rending them gone. It lingered a bit,
though, for rumbling wheels came over the drawbridge once more, and
voices clamoured to be let in. The guns had returned. The gunners had
deserted, said the escort insolently, and guns being in such case
useless, they had preferred to rejoin their brethren; as for their
officer, he had preferred to go on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301738">Kate Erlton, drawn from the inner room once again by the creaking
of the gates, saw a look pass between one or two of the officers. And
there stood the 74th, smart and steady, waiting for marching
orders. There was no need to close the gates again, since time was up;
the fifteen minutes had slipped by, bringing no help, just as the long
hours had dragged by uselessly. So the gate stood open to the
familiar, friendly landscape, all aglow with the rays of the setting
sun. Close at hand, within a stone's throw, lay the tall trees and
dense flowering thickets of the Koodsia gardens, where fugitives might
have found cover. To the left were the ravines and rocks of the Ridge,
fatal to mounted pursuit, and in the centre lay the road northwards,
leading straight to the Punjâb, straight from that increasing
roar of the city. There had been no attack as yet; but every soul
within the main-guard knew for a certainty that the first hint of
retreat would bring it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301739">How could it do otherwise? The decisive answer of the magazine,
with its thousand-and-odd good reasons against the belief that the
master was helpless, had died away. The refuse and rabble of the city
had ceased to wander awestruck among the ruins, murmuring, 'What
tyranny is here?'--that passive, resigned comment of the weaker
brother in India. In the palace, too, they had recovered the shock of
the mean trick of the Nine, who however must, thank Heaven, be all
dead too.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301740">So, as the gate stood open, and the sun streamed through it into
the wide courtyard, glinting on the buckles and bayonets, Major
Abbott's voice rose quietly. 'Are you ready, Gordon?' The drawbridge
was clear of the guns now, clear of everything save the slant
shadows.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301741">'All ready, sir,' came the quiet reply.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301742" n="231 SUNSET"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301743">'Number!' called the Commandant; but a voice at his right hand
pleaded swiftly--'Don't wait for sections, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! Let us go!' and another at his left
whispered, 'For God's sake, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! quick, get
them out quick!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301744">Major Abbott hesitated a second, only a second; for the voices were
the voices of good men and true, whom he could trust. 'Fours about!
quick march!' he corrected, and a sort of sigh of relief ran down the
regiment as it swung into position and the feet started
rhythmically. Action at last!--at long last!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301745">'Good-bye, old chap,' said some one cheerfully, but Major Abbott
did not turn. 'Good-bye! Good-bye!' came voices all round; steady
quiet voices, as the disciplined tramp echoed on the drawbridge, and a
bar of scarlet coats grew on the rise of the white road outside.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301746">'Good-bye, Gordon! Good-bye!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301747">The tall figure in its red and gold was under the very arch,
shining, glittering in the sunlight streaming through it. Another step
or two and he would have been beyond it. But the time for goodbye had
come. The time for which the 38th had been waiting all day. He threw
up his arms and fell dead from his horse without a cry, shot through
the heart. The next instant the gate was closed, its creaking
smothered in the wild, senseless cry 'to kill, to kill, to kill,'--in
a wild, senseless rattle of musketry. For there was really no hurry;
the handful of Englishmen were helpless. Major Abbott and his men
might clamour for re-entry at the gate if they chose. They could not
get in. Nor could the remnant of the 74th, deprived of its loyal
companions, and of the only two men who seemed to have controlled it,
do anything. The 54th were helpless also by their own act; for they
had pushed Major Paterson through the gate before it closed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301748">So there was no one left even to try and stem the tide. No one to
check that beast-like cry.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301749">'<hi rend="italic">Mâro! Mâro! Mâro!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301750">But, in truth, it would have been a hopeless task. The game was up;
the only chance was flight. And two, foreseeing this for the last
hour, had already made good theirs by jumping from an embrasure in the
rampart into the ditch, while one, uninjured by the fall, had
scrambled up the counter-scarp, and was running like a hare for those
same thickets of the Koodsia.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301751" n="232 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301752">'Come on! come on!' cried others, seeing their success. And
then?--And then the cries and piteous screams of women reminded them
of something dearer than life, and they ran, back under a hail of
bullets to that upper room which they had forgotten for the
moment. And somehow, despite the cry of kill, despite the whistling
bullets, they managed to drag its inmates to the embrasure. But--oh!
pathos and bathos of poor humanity making smiles and tears come
together!--the women who had stared death in the face all day without
a wink, stood terrified before a twenty-feet scramble with a rope of
belts and handkerchiefs to help them. It needed a round shot to come
whizzing a message of certain death over their heads, to give them
back a courage which never failed again in the long days of wandering
and desperate need that were theirs ere some of them reached
safety.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301753">But Kate neither hesitated, nor jumped. She had not the chance of
doing either. For that longing look of hers through the open gates had
tempted her to creep along the wall nearer to them; so that the rush
to close them jammed her into a corner against a door, which yielded
slightly to her weight. Quick enough to grasp her imminent danger, she
stooped instantly to see if the door could be made to yield
further. And that stoop saved her life, by hiding her from view behind
the crowd. The next moment she had pushed aside a log which had
evidently rolled from some pile within, and slipped sideways into a
dark outhouse. She was safe so far. But was it worth it? The impulse
to go out again and brave merciful death rose keen, until with a
flash, the memory of that escape through the crowd came back to her;
she seemed to hear the changing ready voice of the man who held her,
to feel his quick instinctive grip on every chance of life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301755">Chance! There was a spell in the very word. A minute after logs
jammed the door again, and even had it been set wide, none would have
guessed that a woman full of courage, ay! and hope, crouched behind
the piles of brushwood. So she lay hidden, her strongest emotion,
strange to say, being a raging curiosity to know what had become of
the others, what was passing outside? But she could hear nothing save
confused yells, with every now and again a dominant cry of '<hi rend="italic">Deen Deen</hi>' or '<hi rend="italic">Jai Kali ma!</hi>'
For faith is one of the two great passions which makes men
militant. The other is sex. But<pb xml:id="fswater_1301754" n="233 SUNSET"/> as a rule it
has no cry; it fights silently, giving and asking no words--only
works.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301756">So fought young Mainwaring, who, with his back to that same wall
against which Kate had found him leaning, was using his sword to
better purpose than digging holes in the dust; or rather had adopted a
new method of doing the task! He had not tried to escape as the others
had done; not from superior courage, but because he never even thought
of it. When he was free to choose, how could he think of leaving those
devils unpunished, leaving them unchecked to touch her dead body,
while he lived? He gave a little faint sob of sheer satisfaction as he
felt the first soft resistance, which meant that his sword had cut
sheer into flesh and blood; for all his vigorous young life made for
death, nothing but death. Was not she dead yonder?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301757">So, after a bit, it seemed to him there was too little of it
there--that it came too slowly, with his back to the wall and only
those who cared to go for him within reach,--for the crowd was dense,
too dense for loading and firing; dense with a hustling, horrified
wonder, a confused prodding of bayonets. So, without a sound, he
charged ahead, hacking, hewing, never pausing, not even making for
freedom, but going for the thickest silently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301758">'<hi rend="italic">Amuk! Saiya! A-muk</hi>.' The yell that he was
mad, possessed, rang hideously as men tumbled over each other in their
hurry to escape, in their hurry to have at this wild beast, this
devil, this horror! And they were right. He was possessed. He was life
instinct with death; fulfilled with but one desire--to kill, or to be
killed quickly....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301759">'<hi rend="italic">Saiya! Amuk! Saiya!</hi>--out of his way-out of
his way! <hi rend="italic">Amuk! Saiya!</hi> Fate is with him! The
gods are with him! <hi rend="italic">Saiya! Amuk!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301760">So, by chance, not method--so by sheer terror as well as hacking
and hewing, the tall figure found itself, with but a stagger or two,
outside the wooden gates, out on the city road, out among the gardens
and the green trees. And then 'ip, Hip, Hurray!' His ringing cheer
rose with a sort of laugh in it. For yonder was her house!--her
house!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301762">'Hip, hip, hurray!' As he ran--as he had run in races at school,
his young face glad--the fingers on the triggers behind him wavered in
sheer superstitious funk, and two troopers coming down the road
wheeled back as from a mad dog. The<pb xml:id="fswater_1301761" n="234 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> scarlet coat with its gold epaulettes went crashing into a
group red-handed with their spoil, out of it impartially into a knot
of terrified bystanders, while down the lane left behind it by the
hacking and hewing came bullet after bullet. The fingers on the
triggers wavered, but some found a billet; one badly. He stumbled in
the dust and his left arm fell oddly. But the right still hacked and
hewed as he ran, though the crowd lessened; though it grew thin, too
thin for his purpose--or else his sight was failing? But there, to the
right, the devils seemed thicker again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301763">'Hip! hip! hooray!' No! Trees! Only trees to hew--a
garden:--perhaps the garden about her house--then 'Hip, hip--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301764">He fell headlong on his face, biting the soft earth in sheer
despite as he fell.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301765">'Don't touch him, brothers!' said one of the two or three who had
followed at a distance, as they might have followed a mad dog, which
they hoped others would meet and kill. 'Provoke him not, or the demon
possessing him may possess us. 'Tis never safe to touch till they have
been dead a watch. Then the poison leaves them. Krishn-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>, save us! Saw you how he turned our lead?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301766">'He has eaten mine, I'll swear,' put in another sepoy boastfully,
pointing gingerly with his booted foot to a round scorched hole in the
red coat. 'The muzzle was against him as I fired.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301767">'And mine shall be his portion too,' broke in a new arrival
breathlessly, preparing to fire at the prostrate foe; but the first
speaker knocked aside the barrel with an oath.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301768">'Not while I stand by, since devils choose the best men. As 'tis,
having women in our houses 'twere best to take precautions.' He
stooped down as he spoke, and muttering spells the while, raised a
little heap of dust at the lad's head and feet and outstretched
arms--a little cross of dust, as it were, on which the young body lay
impaled.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301769">'What is 't?' asked a haughty-looking native officer, pausing as he
rode by.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301770">''Tis a hell-doomed who went possessed, and Dittu makes spells to
keep him dead,' said one.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301771">'Fool!' muttered the man. 'He was drunk, likely. They get like
that, the cursed ones, when they take wine.' And he spat piously on
the red coat as he passed on.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301772" n="235 SUNSET"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301773">So they left the lad there lying face down in the growing gloom,
hedged round by spells to keep him from harming women. Left him for
dead.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301774">But the scoffer had been right. He was drunk, but with the Elixir
of Life and Love which holds a soul captive from the clasp of Death
for a space. So, after a time, the cross of dust gave up its victim;
he staggered to his feet again; and stumbling, falling, rising to fall
again, he made his way to the haven where he would be--to the side of
a dead woman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301775">And the birds, startled from their roosting-places by the
stumbling, falling figure, waited, fluttering over the topmost
branches for it to pass, or paused among them to fill up the time with
a last twittering song of good-night to the day; for the sun still
lingered in the heat-haze on the horizon as if loath to take its glow
from that corona of red dust above the northern wall of Delhi; mute
sign of the only protest made, as yet, by the Master against
mutiny.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301776">And now He had left the city to its own devices. The rebels were
free to do as they liked. The three thousand disciplined soldiers,
more or less, might have marched out, had they chosen, and annihilated
the handful of loyal men about the Flagstaff Tower. But it was
sunset--sunset in Rumzân. And the eyes of thousands, who had
been deprived even of a drop of water since dawn, were watching the
red globe sink in the west, hungrily, thirstily. Their ears were
attuned but to one sound--the firework signal from the big mosque
telling that the day's fast was over. The very children on the roofs
were watching, listening, so as to send shrill joyful news that day
was done to their elders below, waiting with their water-pots ready in
their hands.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301777">Besides, in good truth, there was no set purpose from one end of
the city to another. From the Palace to the meanest brothel which had
belched forth its vilest to swell the tide of sheer rascality which
had ebbed and flowed all day, the one thought was still, 'What does it
mean? How long will it last? Where is the Master?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301779">So men ate and drank their fill first, then looked at each other
almost suspiciously, and drifted away to do what pleased them
best. Some to the palace to swell the turmoil of bellicose loyalty to
the King--loyalty which sounded unreal, almost ridiculous, even as it
was spoken. Others to plunder while they could. The bungalows had long
since<pb xml:id="fswater_1301778" n="236 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> been rifled, the very
church bells thrown down and broken--for the time had been ample even
for wanton destruction; but the city remained, and while shops were
being looted inside, the dispossessed Goojurs were busy over Metcalfe
House, tearing up the very books in their revenge. The Flagstaff Tower
lay not a mile away, almost helpless against attack, but no attack was
made; there was in truth no stomach for cold steel in Delhi on the
11th of May 1857--no stomach for anything except safe murder, safe
pillaging. Least of all was it to be found in the Palace, where men
had given the rein to everything they possessed--to their emotions,
their horses, their passions, their aspirations; stabling some in the
King's gardens, some in dream-palaces, some in pigstyes of sheer
brutality; weeping maudlin tears over heaven-sent success, and
boasting of their own prowess in the same breath; squabbling insanely
over the partition of coming honours and emoluments.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301780">Abool-Bukr, drunk as a lord, lurched about asserting his intention
of being Inspector-General of the King's cavalry, and not leaving man,
woman, or child of the hell-doomed alive in India. For he had been
right when he had warned Newâsi to leave him to his own life,
his own death--when he had shrunk from the inherited bloodstains on
his hands, the inherited tinder in his breast. It had caught fire with
the first spark, and there was fresh blood on his hands--the blood of
a Eurasian boy who had tried to defend his sister from drunken
kisses. Some one in the melée had killed the girl and finished
the boy; the Prince himself being saved from greater crime by tumbling
into the gutter and setting his nose a-bleeding; a catastrophe which
had sent him back to the Palace partially sobered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301782">But Princess Farkhoonda Zamâni, safe-housed in the rooms
kept for honoured visitors, knew nothing of this, knew little even of
the disturbances; for she had been a close prisoner since noon--a
prisoner with servants who would answer no questions, with trays of
jewels and dresses as if she had been a bride. She sat in a flutter,
trying to piece out the reason for this kidnapping. Was she to be
married by force to some royal nominee? But why to-day? Why in all
this turmoil, unless she was required as a bribe? The arch-plotter was
capable of that. But to whom? One thing was certain, Abool-Bukr could
know nothing of this--he would not dare, surely!<pb xml:id="fswater_1301781" n="237 SUNSET"/> Suddenly the hot blood tingled through every vein as she lay
all unconsciously enjoying the return to the easeful idleness and
luxury she had renounced. But if he did dare?--it was not mere anger
which brought bewilderment to heart and brain, as she hid her face
from the dim light which filtered in through the lattice--the dim,
scented, voluptuous light from which she had fled once to purer
air?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301783">And not a hundred yards away from where she was trying to steady
her bounding pulses, Abool-Bukr himself was bawling away at his
favourite love-song to a circle of intimates, all of whom he had
already provided with places on the civil list. His head was full of
promises, his skin as full of wine as it could be, and he not be a
mere wastrel unable to enjoy life; for Abool-Bukr gave care to this;
since to be dead drunk was sheer loss of time.
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Ah mistress rare, divine</l><l>Thy lover like a vine</l><l>With tendril arms entwine.'</l></lg></q>
Here his effort to combine gesture with song nearly caused him to fall
off the steps, and roused a roar of laughter from some sepoys
bivouacking under the trees hard by; but Mirza Moghul, passing hastily
to an audience with the King, frowned. To-day, he told himself, when
none knew what might come, the Queen might have her way so far; but
this idle drunkard must be got rid of soon. He would offend the pious
to begin with, and then he could not be trusted. Who could trust a man
who had been known to lure back his hawk because a bird's gay feathers
shone in the sunshine?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301784">But Ahsan-Oolah, dismissed by the Mirza's audience from feeling the
royal pulse, paused as he passed, to recommend a cooling draught if
the Inspector-General of Cavalry wanted to keep his head clear. It was
the physician's panacea for excitement of all kinds; but an exhibition
of steel would have done better on the 11th of May.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301785">There was no one, however, to administer it to Delhi, and even the
refugees in the Flagstaff Tower were beginning to give up hope of its
arriving from Meerut. Those in the storehouse at Duryagunj still clung
to the belief that succour must come somehow; but Kate Erlton behind
the wood-pile knew that her hope lay only in herself.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301786" n="238 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301787">For how could Jim Douglas, as he more than once passed through the
now open and almost deserted Kashmir Gate, in the hope, or rather the
fear, of finding some trace of her, know that she was hidden within a
few yards of him? or how could she distinguish the sound of his
horse's hoofs from the hundreds which passed?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301788">She must have escaped with the others, he concluded, as he galloped
towards Cantonments to see if she were there. But she was not. He had
failed again, he told himself; failed through no fault of his own--for
who could have foretold that madness of retreat from the gate?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301789">So now, there was nothing to be done in Delhi save gather what
information he could, give decent burial--if he could--to Alice
Gissing's body, and, if no troops arrived before dawn, leave the
city.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0306" n="6" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI<lb/>DUSK</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301790">'I ENTREAT you to leave, sir. Believe me there is nothing else to
be done now. It will be dark in half an hour, and we shall need every
minute of the night to reach Kurnal.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301792">It was said openly now by many voices. It had been hinted first
when--the corona of red dust having just sprung to hide the swelling
white dome of the distant mosque a dismal procession had come slowly
up the steep road to the tower with a ghastly addition to the little
knot of white faces there; come very slowly, the drivers of the oxen
whacking and jibing at them as if the cart held logs or refuse; as if
the driving of it were quite commonplace. Yet in a way the six bodies
of English gentlemen it had held were welcome additions; since it is
something to see a dear face even when it is dead. But they were
fateful additions, making the disloyal 38th regiment posted furthest
from the Tower--partly commanded by it and the guns, in case of
aecident--shift restlessly. If others had done such work, ought not
they to be up and doing? And now another procession came filing up
from the city--the two guns returning from the Kashmir Gate. They came
on sullenly, slowly, yet still they came on; another few minutes and
the refugees would have been the<pb xml:id="fswater_1301791" n="239 DUSK"/> stronger, the
chances of mutiny weaker. The 38th saw this. Their advanced picquet
rushed out, drove off the gunners and the officers, and, fixing
bayonets, forced the drivers to wheel and set off down the road again
at a trot. And down the road, commanded by other guns, they went
unchecked; for the refugees did not dare to give the order to fire,
lest it should be disobeyed. The effect, we read, would probably have
been '<hi rend="italic">that the guns would have been swung round and
fired on the order-ers, and so not a European would have escaped to
tell the tale; this catastrophe, however, was mercifully averted and
the crisis passed over.</hi>' It reads strangely, but there were
women and children to think of; and few men are strong enough to say,
much less to set down in black and white as John Nicholson did, that
the protection 'of women and children in some crises is such a very
minor consideration that it ceases to be a consideration at all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301793">Still, it began to be patent to every one that there was little
good in remaining in a place where they did not dare to defend
themselves. There were carriages and horses ready; the road to Kurnal
was still fairly safe. Would it not be better to retreat? But the
Brigadier held out. He had, in deference partly to others, wholly for
the sake of his helpless charges, weakened the city post. Why should
he have done that if he meant to abandon his own? Then he was an old
sepoy officer who had served boy and man in one regiment, rising to
its command at last, and he was loath to believe that the 38th
regiment, which had been specially commended to him by his own, would
turn against him, if only he were free to handle it. And this hope
gained colour from the fact, that to him personally and to his direct
orders, the regiment was still cheerfully obedient.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301794">So the waiting went on, and there were no signs of the 74th
returning. What had happened? Fresh disaster? The voices urging
retreat grew louder.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301795">'Have it your own way, gentlemen,' said the Brigadier at last. 'The
women and children had better go, at any rate, and they will need
protection; so let all retire who will, and in what way seems best to
them. I stay here.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301796">So on foot, on horseback, in carriages, the exodus began forthwith;
hastening more rapidly when the first man to jump from the embrasure
at the Kashmir Gate arrived with that tale of hopeless
calamity.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301797" n="240 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301798">But still the Brigadier refused to join the rout. He had been
hanging on the skirts of Hope all day, trying--wisely or unwisely--to
shield women and children behind that frail shelter. So he had been
tied hand and foot; now he would be free. True! the mystery of
oncoming dusk made that red city in the distance loom larger, but a
handful of desperate men unhampered, with plenty of ammunition, might
surely hold such a post as the Flagstaff Tower till help arrived. He
meant to try, at any rate. Then nearly half of the 74th had got away
safely--they were long in turning up certainly--but when they came
they would form a nucleus. The 54th were not all bad, or they would
not have saved their Major. Even the 38th, if they could once be got
away from the sight of weakness, from that ghastly cart with its mute
witness to successful murder, might respond to a familiar commonplace
order. They were creatures of habit, with drill born in the blood,
bred in the bone.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301799">'I stay here,' he said shortly; and said it again, even when
neither the escaped officers nor the men turned up. He said it again,
when the guns rolled off towards Meerut, leaving him face to face with
a sprinkling of the 74th and 54th, and the great mass of the 38th
sullen, but still obedient.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301800">The sun, now some time set, had left a flaming pennant in the sky,
barring it low down on the horizon with a blood-red glow marking the
top of the dust-haze, and the quick chill of colour which, in India
comes with the lack of sunlight even while its heat lingers to the
touch, had fallen upon all things. Upon the red Ridge, upon the
distant line of trees marking the canal, and upon the level plain
between them where all the familiar landmarks of Cantonment life still
showed clearly, despite the darkening sky. Guard-rooms, lines,
bells-of-arms, wide parade-grounds--all the familiar surroundings of a
sepoy's life, and behind them that red flare of a day that was
done.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301801">'There is no use, sir, in stopping longer,' said the brigade-major,
almost compassionately, to the figure which sat its horse steadfastly,
but with a despondent droop of the shoulders.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301803">'No possible use, sir,' echoed the staff doctor kindly. The three
were facing westward, for that vain hope of help from the east had
been given up at last; and behind them, barely audible, was the faint
hum of the distant city. A shaft of<pb xml:id="fswater_1301802" n="241 DUSK"/> cormorants
flying <hi rend="italic">jheel</hi>-wards with barbed arrow head,
trailed across the purpling sky; below them the red pennant was fading
steadily. The day was done. But to one pair of eyes there seemed still
a hope, still a last appeal to something beyond east or west.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301804">'Bugler! sound the assembly!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301805">The Brigadier's voice rang sharp over the plain and was followed,
quick as an echo--quick from that habit of obedience on which so much
depended--by the cheerful notes--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301806">'<hi rend="italic">Come--to the co-lours! Come quick, come
all--come quick, come all--come quick! Quick! Come to the
colours!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301807">Last appeal to honour and good faith, to memory and confidence! But
they had passed with the day.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301808">Yet not quite, for as the rocks and stones, the distant lines, the
familiar landmarks gave back the call, a solitary figure, trim and
smart in the uniform of the loyal 74th, fell in and saluted. In all
that wide plain one man true to his salt, heroic utterly, standing
alone in the dusk. A nameless figure, like many another hero. Yet
better so, when we remember that but a few hours before his regiment
had <hi rend="italic">volunteered to a man</hi> against their comrades and their country!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301809">So sepoy--, of company--, can stand there, outlined against the
dying day upon the parade-ground at Delhi, as a type of others who
might have stood there also, but for the lack of that cloud of dust
upon the Meerut road.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301810">Brigadier Graves wheeled his horse slowly northwards; but at the
sight the sepoys of the 38th, still friendly to him personally,
crowded round him urging speed. It was no place for him, they said. No
place for the master.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301811">Palpably not. It was time, indeed, for the thud of retreating hoofs
to end the incident. So far, at any rate, as the master was concerned;
the actual finale of the tragic mistake being a disciplined tramp, as
the sepoy who had fallen in at the last Assembly, fell out again--at
his own word of command--and followed the master doggedly.<ref target="#fswatern241">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern241" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">He was killed fighting for us soon afterwards.</note></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301813">'God be praised!' said the 38th, as with curious deliberation they
took possession of the cantonments. 'That is over! He has gone in
safety, and we have kept the promise given to our brothers of the 56th
not to harm him.' So, joined by their comrades from the city, they set
guards and gave out rations, with double and treble doses of rum;
played the<pb xml:id="fswater_1301812" n="242 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> master, in fact,
perfectly; until, in the darkness, a rumble arose upon the road, and
one half of the actors fled citywards incontinently and the other half
went to bed in their huts like good boys. But it was not the troops
from Meerut at last. It was only their old friends the guns, once more
brought back from the fugitives by comrades who had finally decided to
stand by the winning side.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301814">So the question has once more to be asked, 'What would have
happened, if, even at that eleventh hour, there really had been a
cloud of dust on the Meerut road?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301815">As it was, confidence and peace were restored. In the city, indeed,
they had never been disturbed. It seemed weary, bewildered by the
topsy-turvydom of the day, desirous chiefly of sleep and dreams; so
that Kate Erlton, peering out through a chink in the wood-store, felt
that if she were ever to escape from the slow starvation which stared
her in the face, she could choose no better time than this, when
traffic had ceased, and the moon had not yet risen. She had settled
that her best chance lay in creeping along the wall at first, then,
taking advantage of the gardens, cutting across to that same
sally-port through which the heroes of the magazine had told her they
had made their escape. She did not know the exact situation, but she
could surely find it. Besides, the ruins would most likely be
deserted, and the other gates of the city, even if they were not
closed for the night, as the gate here was, would be guarded. Once out
of the city, she meant to make for the Flagstaff Tower; for, of
course, she knew nothing of its desertion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301817">So she set the door ajar softly, and crept out. And as she did so,
the whiteness of her own dress, even in the dense blackness, startled
her, and roused the trivial wish that she had put on her navy-blue
cotton instead, as she had meant to do that day. Strange! how a mere
chance...the word was like a spur always, and she crept along the
wall, hoping that the smoking flaring fire of refuse in the opposite
corner round which the guards were sitting so as to be free of
mosquitoes, might dazzle their eyes. It was her only chance, however,
so she must risk it. Then suddenly, under her foot, she felt something
long, curved, snakelike. It was all she could do not to scream; but
she set her teeth, and trod down hard with all her strength, her heart
beating wildly in the awful suspense. But nothing struck her, there
was no<pb xml:id="fswater_1301816" n="243 DUSK"/> movement. Had she killed it? Her hand
went down in the dark with a terror in it lest her touch should light
on the head--perhaps within reach of the fangs. But she forced herself
to the touch, telling herself she was a coward, a fool--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301819">Thank Heaven? It was no snake after all, only a rope; a rope that
must have been used for tethering a horse, for here under her foot was
straw, rustling horribly. No! not now--that was something soft. A
blanket!--a horse's double blanket, dark as the darkness itself. Here
was a chance, indeed! She caught it up, and paused deliberately in the
darkest corner of the square, to slip off shoes and stockings,
petticoats and bodices; then, in the scantiest of costumes, winding
the long blanket round her, ayah's fashion, as a skirt and veil. Her
face could be hidden by a modest down-drop over it, her white hands
hidden away by the modest drawing of a fold across her mouth. Her
feet, then, were the only danger, and the dust would darken them. She
must risk that anyhow. So, boldly, she slipped out of the corner, and
made for the gate, remembering, to her comfort, that it was not
England where a lonely woman might be challenged all the more for her
loneliness. In this heathen land, that down-dropped veil hedged even a
poor grass-cutter's wife about with respect. What is more, even if she
were challenged, her proper course would be to be silent and hurry
on. But no one challenged her, and she passed on into the denser
shadows of the church garden to regain her breath; for it had gone
somehow. Why she knew not; she had not felt frightened. Then the
question came, what next? Get to the magazine, somehow; but the strain
of looking forward seemed far worse than the actual doing, so she went
on without settling anything, save that she would avoid roads, and
give the still-smoking roofless bungalows as wide a berth as possible,
lest, in the dark, she should come on some dead thing--a friend
perhaps. And with the thought came that of Alice Gissing. The house
lay right on her path to the magazine. Surely she must be near it
now. Was that the long sweep of its roof against the sky? If she could
see so much, the moon must be rising, and she could have no time to
lose. As she crept along through the garden, she wondered why the
bungalow had not been burnt like the others. Perhaps the ayah's
friends had saved it, or, perhaps,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301818" n="244 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> there had not been much to attract robbers in the little
hired house. Or, perhaps--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301820">Hark! She crouched back from the sound of voices close beside her,
and doubled a bit; but they seemed to follow her. Yet straight ahead
the trees ended, and she must brave the open space by the house
itself; unless, indeed, she slipped by the row of servant's houses to
the verandah, and so--through the rooms--gain the further side. Or she
might hide in the house till these voices passed. There they were
again! She made a breathless dash for the shadow, ran on till she
found the verandah, and deciding to hide for a time, passed in at the
first door the door of the room where she had left Alice Gissing lying
dead a few hours before. But it was too dark, as yet, to see if she
lay there still, too dark to see even if the house had been
plundered. It must have been, however, for the very floor-cloths were
gone and the concrete struck cold to her feet. A sudden terror at the
darkness, the emptiness, coming over her, she passed on rapidly to the
faintly-glimmering square of the further door, seen through the
intervening rooms. There were three of them; bedroom, drawing-room,
dining-room, set in a row in Indian fashion, all leading into each
other, all opening on to the verandah; the two end ones opening also
into the side verandah. She could get out again, therefore, by this
further door. But it was bolted; she undid the bolts, only to find it
hasped on the outside. A feeling of being trapped seized upon her. She
ran to the other door--hasped also! The drawing-room door?--firmer
even than the others! But what a fool she was to feel so frightened,
when she could always go out as she had come in, when the voices had
passed? She stole back softly, knowing they must be just outside, and
almost fancying, softly, her alarm, that she heard a step in the
verandah. But there was the glimmering square of escape--open?
No!--shut too!--shut from the outside.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301821">Had they seen her and shut the door? And there, indeed, were
footsteps! Loud footsteps and voices coming up the long flight of
steps which led to the verandah from the road--coming straight, and
she locked in, helpless.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301823">She threw up her hands involuntarily at a bright flash in the
verandah. Was it lightning? No! a pistol shot--a quick curse--a
fall--a yell of rage--a rush of those feet upon the steps, and then
another flash, another, and another! Then<pb xml:id="fswater_1301822" n="245 DUSK"/> more
curses and a confused clashing! She stood as if turned to stone,
listening. Hark! down the steps surely, this time, came another rush,
a cry, a scuffle, a fall: then, loud and unmistakable, a laugh! then
silence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301824">Merciful heavens! what was it? What had happened? She shook at the
door gently, but still there was silence. Then, gripping the woodwork
she tried to peer out; but she could only see the bit of verandah in
front of her which, being latticed in and hung with creepers, was very
dark. The rest was invisible from within. She leant her ear on the
glass and listened. Was that a faint breathing? 'Who's there?' she
cried softly; but there was no answer. She sank down on the floor in
sheer bewilderment and tried to think what to do, and after a time, a
faint glimmer of the rising moon aiding her, she went round to every
door and tried it again. They were all locked inside and out. And now
she could see that the house had been pillaged to the uttermost. There
was literally nothing left in it. Nothing to aid her fingers if she
tried to open the doors. By breaking the upper panes of glass, of
course, she could undo the top bolt, but how was she to reach the
bottom ones behind the lower panels? And why--why had they been
locked? Who had locked the one by which she had come in? What was
there that needed protection in that empty house? Was there by chance
some one else? Then, suddenly, the remembrance of what she had left
lying in the end room hours before came back to her. She had forgotten
it utterly in her alarm and she crept back to see if Alice Gissing
still kept her company. The bed was gone, but by the steadily-growing
glimmer of the moon she could see something lying on the floor in the
very centre of the room. Something strangely orderly, with a look of
care and tidiness about it; but not white--and <hi rend="italic">her</hi> dress had been white--Kate knelt down beside it
and touched the still figure gently. What had it been covered with?
Some sort of network, fine--silken--crimson; an officer's sash surely!
And now her eyes becoming accustomed to what lay before them, and the
light growing, she saw that the curly head rested on an officer's
scarlet coat. The gold epaulettes were arranged neatly on either side
the delicate ears so as not to touch them. Who had done this? Then
that step she had thought she heard in the verandah must have been a
real one--some one must have been watching the dead woman--</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301825" n="246 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301826">She was at the door in an instant, rapping at a pane--'Herbert!
Herbert! are you there? Herbert! Herbert!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301827">He might have done this thing! He might have come over from Meerut,
for he had loved the dead woman, he had loved her dearly; but there
was no answer. So, wrapping the blanket round her hand, she dashed it
through the pane, and removing the glass, managed to crane out a
little. She could see better now. Was that some one, or only a heap of
clothes in the shadow of the corner by the inner wall? By this time
the moonlight was shining white on the orange-trees on the further
side of the road. She could see beyond them to the garden, but nothing
of the road itself, nothing of the steep flight of steps leading down
to it; for a balustrade set with pots which filled up all but the
centre arch prevented that.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301828">'Herbert!' she cried again louder; 'Is that you?' But there was not
a sound. God in Heaven! who lay there? dying or dead?...</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301829">Her helplessness broke down her self-control at last, and she crept
back into the room, back to the old companionship, crying
miserably. Ah! she was so tired, so weary of it all; so glad to rest!
A sense of real physical relief came to her body as, for the first
time for long, long hours, she let her muscles slacken; and to her
mind as she let herself cry on, like a child, forgetting the cause of
grief in the grief itself. Forgetting even <hi rend="italic">that</hi>
after a time in sheer rest; so that the moon, when it had climbed high
enough to peep in through the closed doors, found her asleep, her arms
spread out over the crimson net-work, her head resting on what lay
beneath it. But she slept dreamfully, and once her voice rose in the
quick anxious tones of those who talk in their sleep--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301830">'Freddy! Freddy!' she called, 'Save Freddy, some one! Never mind,
ayah! He is only a boy, and the other, the other may....'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301832">Then her words merged into each other uncertainly, after the manner
of dreamers, and she slept sounder. Soundest of all, however, in the
cool before the dawn; so that she did not wake with a stealthy foot in
the side verandah, a stealthy hand on the hasp outside; did not wake
even when Jim Douglas stood beside her, looking down vexedly on the
blanket-shrouded figure pillowed on the body he came to seek. For he
had been delayed by a thousand<pb xml:id="fswater_1301831" n="247 DUSK"/> difficulties, and
though the shallow grave was ready dug in the garden, the presence of
this native--even though a woman, apparently--must make his task
longer. Was it a woman? One hand on his revolver, he laid the other on
the sleeper's shoulder. His touch brought Kate to her feet blindly,
without a cry, to meet Fate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301833">'My God! Mrs. Erlton!' he cried, and she recognised his voice at
once. Fate indeed! His chance and hers! His chance and hers!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301834">She stood half stupefied by her dreams, her waking; but he, after
his nature, was ready in a second for action, and broke in on his own
wondering questions impatiently. 'But we are losing time.--Quick! you
must get to some safer place before dawn. Twist that blanket
right--let me, please. That will do. Now, if you will follow close, I
must get you hidden somewhere for to-day. It is too near dawn for
anything else. Come!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301835">She put out her hand vaguely, as if to stave his swift decision
away, and, looking in her face, he recognised that she must have time,
that he must curb his own energy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301836">'Then it was you who fired,' she said in a dull voice. 'You who
shut me in here.--You who killed those voices.--Why didn't you answer
when I called, when I thought it was Herbert?--It was very
unkind--very unkind.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301837">He stared at her for a second, and then his hand went out and
closed on hers firmly. 'Mrs. Erlton! I'm going to save you if I
can.--Come! I don't know what you're talking about, and there is no
time for talk.--Come!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301838">Hand in hand, they passed into the side verandah, through which he
had entered, and so--since the nearest way to the city lay down that
flight of steps--to the front one.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301839">'Take care,' he cried, half-stumbling himself, and forcing her to
avoid something that lay huddled up against the wall. It was a dead
man. And there, upon the steps which showed white as marble in the
moonlight, were two others in a heap; a third lower down, ghastlier
still, lying amid dark stains marring the whiteness, and with a gaping
cut clearly visible on the shoulder.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301841">But that still further down! Jim Douglas gave a quick cry, dropped
Kate's hand, and was on his knees beside the tall young
figure--coatless, its white shirt stiff with blood--which lay head
downwards on the last steps as if it had<pb xml:id="fswater_1301840" n="248 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> pitched forward in some mad pursuit. As he turned it
over on its back gently, the young face showed in the moonlight stern,
yet still exultant, and the sword, still clenched in the stiff right
hand, rattled on the steps.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301842">'Mainwaring! I don't understand,' he said, looking up bewildered
into Kate's face. The puzzle had gone from it; she seemed roused to
life again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301843">'I understand now,' she said softly, and as she spoke she stooped
and raised the boy's head tenderly in her hands. 'Don't let us leave
him here,' she went on eagerly, hastily. 'Leave him there,
beside--beside--<hi rend="italic">her</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301844">Jim Douglas made no reply. He understood also dimly, and he only
signed to her to take the feet instead. So together they managed to
place that dead weight within the threshold and close the door.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301845">Then Jim Douglas held out his hand again, but there was a new
friendliness in its grip. 'Come!' he said and there was a new ring in
his voice--'the night is far spent, the day is at hand.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301846">It was true. As they stepped from the now waning moonlight into the
shadow of the trees, the birds, beginning to dream of dawn, shifted
and twittered faintly among the branches. And once, startling them
both, there was a louder rustling from a taller tree, a flutter of
broad white wings to a perch nearer the city, a half-sleepy cry
of--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301847">'<hi rend="italic">Deen! Deen! Futteh Mahomed!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301848">'If I had time,' muttered Jim Douglas fiercely, 'I would go and
wring that cursed bird's neck! But for it--' Kate's tighter clasp on
his hand seemed like an appeal, and he went on in silence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301849">So, as they slipped from the gardens into the silent streets, the
<hi rend="italic">muazzim's</hi> monotonous chant began from the
shadowy minaret of the big mosque.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301850">'Prayer is more than sleep!--than sleep!--than sleep!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301851">The night was far spent; the day was indeed at hand;--and what
would it bring forth? Jim Douglas, with a sinking at his heart, told
himself he could at least be thankful that one day was

noon. Its hot rose-red walls and arcades seemed to shimmer in the
glare, and the dazzle and glitter gave a strange air of unreality, of
instability to all things: to the crowds of loungers taking their <hi rend="italic">siesta</hi> in every arcade and every scrap of shadow,
to the horses stabled in rows in the glare and the blaze, to the eager
groups of new arrivals which, from time to time, came in from the
outer world by the cool, dark tunnel of the Lahore gate to stand for a
second, as if blinded by the shimmer and glitter, before becoming a
part of that silent, drowsy stir of life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301854">From an arch close to the inner entry to the precincts, rose a
monotonous voice reading aloud. The reader was evidently the author
also, for his frown of annoyance was unmistakable at a sudden
diversion caused by the entry of a dozen or more armed men, shouting
at the top of their voices: '<hi rend="italic">Pâdishâh,
Pâdishâh</hi>&gt;! We be fighters for the faith. <hi rend="italic">Pâdishâh</hi>! a blessing, a
blessing!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301855">A malicious laugh came from one of the listeners in the arcade--a
woman shrouded in a Pathan veil.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301857">''Tis as well his Majesty hath taken another cooling draught,' came
her voice shrilly. 'What with writing letters for help to the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> to please Ahsan-Oolah and Elâhi
Buksh, and blessing faith to please the Queen, he hath enough to do in
keeping his brain from getting dizzy with whirling this way and
that. Mayhap faith will fail first, since it is not satisfied with
blessings. They are windy diet, and I heard Mahboob say an hour agone
that there was too<pb xml:id="fswater_1301856" n="250 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> much
faith for the Treasury. Lo! <hi rend="italic">moonshee-jee</hi>, put
that fact down among thy heroics--they need balance!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301858">'Sure, niece Hâfzan,' reproved the old editor of the Court
Journal, 'I see naught that needs it. Syyed Abdulla's periods fit the
case as peas fit a pod; they hang together--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301859">'As we shall when the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> return,'
assented the voice from the veil.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301860">'They will return no more, woman!' said another. It belonged to a
man who leant against a pilaster, looking dreamily out into the glare
where, after a brief struggle, the band of fighters for the faith had
pushed aside the timid door-keepers and forced their way to the inner
garden. Through the open door they showed picturesquely, surging down
the path, backed by green foliage and the white dome of the Pearl
Mosque rising against the blue sky.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301861">'The faith! the faith! We come to fight for the faith!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301862">Their cry echoed over the drowsy, dreaming crowds, making men turn
over in their sleep; that was all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301863">But the dreaminess grew in the face looking at the vista through
the open door till its eyes became like those Botticelli gives to his
Moses--the eyes of one who sees a promised land--and the dreamy voice
went on--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301864">'How can they return; seeing that He is Lord and Master?<ref target="#fswatern250">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern250" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">From the account in the native papers.</note> Changing

Dignity, the Avenger of His Faithful people.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301865">The old editor waggled his head with delighted approval; the author
fidgeted over an eloquence not his own; but Hâfzan's high laugh
rang cynically--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301866">'That may be so, most learned divine; yet I, Hâfzan, the
hareem scribe, write no orders nowadays for king or queen without the
proviso of "<hi rend="italic">writ by a slave in pursuance of lawful
order and under fear of death</hi>" in some quiet corner. For I have
no fancy, see you, for hanging, even if it be in good company. But go
on with thy leading article, <hi rend="italic">moonshee-jee</hi>, I
will interrupt no more.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301868">'Thus by a single revolution of time the state of affairs is
completely reversed,'* and the great and memorable event which took
place four days ago must be looked upon as a practical warning to the
uninformed and careless, namely the<pb xml:id="fswater_1301867" n="251 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/> British officers and those who never dreamt of the
decline and fall of their government, but who have now convincing
proof of what has been written in the Indelible Tablets by God. The
following brief account, therefore, of the horrible and memorable
events is given here solely for the sake of those still inclined to
treat them as a dream. On Monday the 16th of Rumzân, that holy
month in which the Word of God came down to earth, and in which, for
all time, lies the Great Night of Power, the courts being open early
on account of the hot weather, the magistrate discharging his wonted
duties, suddenly the bridge toll-keeper appeared, informing him that a
few Toork troopers had first crossed the bridge--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301869">The dreamy-faced divine turned in sharp reproach. 'Not so, <hi rend="italic">Syyed-jee</hi>. The vision came first--the vision of the
blessed Lord Ali seen by the <hi rend="italic">muazzim</hi>. Would'st
make this time as other times, and deny the miracles by which it is
attested as of God?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301870">'Miracles,' echoed Hâfzan. 'I see no miracle in an old man
on a camel.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301871">The divine frowned. 'Nor in a strange white bird with a golden
crown, which hovered over the city giving the sacred cry? Nor in the
fulfilment of Hussan Askuri's dream?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301872">Hâfzan burst into shrill laughter. 'Hussan Askuri! Lo!
Moulvie Mahomed Ismail, didst thou know the arch dreamer as I, thou
wouldst not credit his miracles. He dreams to the Queen's order as a
bear dances to the whip. And as thou knowest, my mistress hath the
knack of jerking the puppet-strings. She hath been busy these days,
and even the Princess Farkhoonda--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301873">'What of the princess?.' asked the news-writer, eagerly nibbling
his pen in anticipation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301874">'Nay, not so!' retorted Hâfzan. 'I give no news nowadays,
since I cannot set "<hi rend="italic">spoken under fear of death</hi>"
upon the words.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301875">She rose as she spoke, yet lingered, to stand a second beside the
divine and say in a softer tone, 'Dreams are not safe, even to the
pious, as thou, Moulvie-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>. A bird is none
the less a bird because it is strange to Delhi and hath been taught to
speak. That it was seen all know; yet, for all that, it may be one of
Hussan Askuri's tricks.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301877">'Let it be so, woman,' retorted Mahomed Ismail almost fiercely, 'Is
there not miracle enough and to spare without it?<pb xml:id="fswater_1301876" n="252 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Did not the sun rise four days ago upon infidels
in power? Where are they now? Were there not two thousand of them in
Meerut? Did they strike a blow? Did they strike one here? Where is
their strength? Gone! I tell thee--gone!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301878">Hâfzan laid a veiled clutch on his arm suddenly and her
other hand, widening the folds of her shapeless form mysteriously,
pointed into the blaze and shimmer of sunlight. 'It lies there,
Moulvie-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, it lies there,' she said in a
passionate whisper, 'for God is on their side.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301879">It was a pitiful little group to which she pointed. A woman, her
mixed blood showing in her face, her Christianity in her dress, being
driven along like a sheep to the shambles across the courtyard. She
clasped a year-old baby to her breast and a handsome little fellow of
three toddled at her skirts. She paused in a scrap of shade thrown by
a tree which grew beside a small cistern or reservoir near the middle
of the court, and shifted the heavy child in her arms, looking round,
as she did so, with a sort of wild, fierce fear, like that of a hunted
animal. The cluster of sepoys who had made their prisoner over to the
palace guard turned hastily from the sight; but the guard drove her on
with coarse jibes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301880">'The rope dangles close, Moulvie-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>,' came
Hâfzan's voice again. 'Ropes, said I?--gentle ropes? Nay! only
as the wherewithal to tie writhing limbs as they roast. If thou hast a
taste for visions, pious one, tell me what thou seest ahead for the
murderers of such poor souls?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301881">'Murderers,' echoed Mahomed Ismail swiftly; 'there is no talk of
murder. 'Tis against our religion. Have I not signed the edict against
it? Have we not protested against the past iniquity of criminals, and
ignorant beasts, and vile libertines like Prince Abool-Bukr, who take
advantage--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301882">'He was too drunk for much evil, learned one!' sneered Hafzan,
'Godly men do worse than he in their own homes, as I know to my
cost. As for thine edict! Take it to the Princess Farkhoonda! She is a
simple soul, though she holds the vilest liver of Delhi in a
leash. But the Queen--the Queen is of a different mettle, as you
edict-signers will find. There are nigh fifty such prisoners in the
old cook-room now. Wherefore?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301883">'For safety. There are nigh forty in the city police station
also.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301885">Hâfzan gathered her folds closer, 'Truly thou art a
simple<pb xml:id="fswater_1301884" n="253 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/> soul also, pious divine. Dost
not think there is a difference, still, between the palace and the
city? But God save all women, black or white, say I! Save them from
men, and since we be all bound to Hell together by virtue of our sex,
then will it be a better place than Paradise by having fewer men in
it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301886">She flung her final taunts over her shoulder at her hearers as she
went limping off.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301887">'Heed her not, most pious!' said her uncle apologetically, 'She
hath been mad against men even since hers, being old and near his end,
took her, a child, and--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301888">But Moulvie Mahomed Ismail was striding across the courtyard to the
long, low, half-ruinous shed in which the prisoners were kept.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301889">'Have they proper food, and water ?' he asked sharply of the guard,
'the King gave orders for it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301890">'It comes but now!' replied the sergeant glibly, pointing to a file
of servants bearing dishes which were crossing the courtyard from the
royal kitchens. The Moulvie gave a sigh of relief, for Hâfzan's
hints had alarmed him. These same helpless prisoners lay on his
conscience, since he and his like were mainly responsible for the
diligent search for Christians which had been going on during the last
few days; for it was not to be tolerated that the faithful should risk
salvation by concealing them. The proper course was plain,
unmistakable. They should be given up to the authorities and be made
into good Mohammedans; by persuasion if possible, if not, by force. In
truth the Moulvie dreamt already of ninety and odd willing converts,
as a further manifestation of divine favour. Perhaps more; though most
of these ill-advised attempts at concealment must have come to an end
by now.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301891">They had indeed; those four days of peace, of hourly increasing
religious enthusiasm for a cause so evidently favoured by High Heaven,
had made it well nigh impossible to carry on a task, attempted by many
when it seemed likely to last for a few hours only.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301894">Even Jim Douglas told himself he must fail unless he could get
help. He had succeded so far, simply because--by a mere chance--he
had, not one, but several, places of concealment ready to his hand
without the necessity for taking any one into his confidence. For he
had found it convenient in his work to have cities of refuge, as it
were, where he could escape from curiosity or change a disguise at
leisure.<pb xml:id="fswater_1301892" n="254 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> The shilling or so
a month required for the rent of a room in some tenement house being
more than repaid by the sense of security the possession gave him. It
was to one of these, therefore, that he took Kate on the dawn of the
12th, leaving her locked up in it alone till night enabled him to take
her on to another; so by constant change managing to escape
suspicion. But as the days passed in miraculous peace, he recognised
the hopelessness of continuing this life for long. To begin with,
Kate's nerves could not stand it. She was brave enough, but she had an
imagination, and what woman with that could stand being left alone in
the dark for twelve hours at a time, never knowing if the slow
starvation which would be her fate if anything untoward happened to
him, had not already begun? He could not expect her to stand it, when
three days of something far less difficult had left him haggard, his
nerves unstrung; left him with the possibility looming in the future
of his losing his self-control some day, and going madly for the whole
world as young Mainwaring had done. Not that he cared for Kate's
safety so much, as that the mere thought of failure roused a
beast-like ferocity in him. So, as he wandered restlessly about the
city, waiting in a fever of impatience for some sign of the world
without those rose-red walls; waiting day by day, with a growing
tempest of rage, for the night to return and let him creep up some
dark stairs and assure himself of a woman's safety, he was piecing
together a plan in case. Of what?--in case the stories he heard in the
bazaars were true? No! that was impossible. How could the English have
been wiped out of India? Yet as he saw the deserted shops being
re-opened in solemn procession by an old pantaloon on an elephant
calling himself the Emperor, when he saw Abool-Bukr letting off squibs
in general rejoicing over the re-establishment of Mohammedan empire;
above all when he saw the tide of life returning to the streets, his
mad desire to strike a blow and smash the sham was tempered by an
almost unbearable curiosity as to what had really happened. But he
dared not try and find out. Useless though he knew it was, he hung
round the quarter where Kate lay concealed for the day, feeling a
certain consolation in knowing that he was as close to her as he dared
to be. Such a life was manifestly impossible, and so, bit by bit, his
plan grew. Yet when it had grown, he<pb xml:id="fswater_1301893" n="255 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/> almost shrank from it, so strange did it seem, in its
linking of the past with the present. For Kate must pass as his
wife--his sick wife, hidden, as Zora had been, on some terraced roof,
with Tara as her servant; he, meanwhile, passing as an Afghan
horse-dealer, kept from returning north, like others of his trade, by
this illness in his house. The plan was perfectly feasible if Tara
would consent; and Jim Douglas, though he ignored his own certainty,
never really doubted that she would. He had not been born in the
mist-covered mountains of the north for nothing. Their mysticism was
part of his nature, and he felt that he had saved the Rajpootni for
this; that for this, and this only, he had played that childish but
successful cantrip with her hair. In a way, was not the pathetic idyll
on the roof with little Zora but a rehearsal of a tragedy--a rehearsal
without which he could not have played his part? Strange thread of
fate, indeed, linking these women together! and though he shrank from
admitting its very existence, it gave him confidence that the whole
would hang together securely. So that when he sought Tara out, his
only real doubt was whether it would be wiser to tell her the truth
about Kate, or assert that she <hi rend="italic">was</hi> his wife. He chose the latter as
less risky, since, even if Tara refused aid, she would not overtly
betray any one belonging to him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301896">But Tara did not refuse. To begin with, she could have refused
nothing in the first joy of finding him safe when she had believed him
dead like all the other Huzoors. And then a vast confusion of love and
pride and remorse, and fierce passionate denial of all three, led her
into consent. If the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> wanted her to help
to save his wife why should she object?--though it was nothing to her
if the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was his <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>
or not. Jim Douglas, listening to the eager protest, wondered if he
might not safely have saved himself an unnecessary complication. But
then he wondered at many things Tara said and did; at her quick frown
when he promised her both hair and locket as her reward; at the faint
quiver amid the scorn with which she had replied that he would still
want the latter for the <hi rend="italic">mem's</hi> hair; at her slow
smile when he opened the gold oval to show the black lock still in
sole possession. She had turned aside to look, at the hearth-cakes she
had been toasting when he came in, and then gone into the necessary
details of arrangement in the most matter-of-fact way. Naturally the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> had sought<pb xml:id="fswater_1301895" n="256 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> help from his servant. From whom else could he seek it?
As for her saintship, there was nothing new in that. She had been <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> always as the master very well knew. So
nothing she did for him, or he for her, could make <hi rend="italic">that</hi> suffer. Therefore she would arrange as she had
arranged for Zora. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> must rent a
roof--roofs were safest--and she would engage a half-blind half-deaf
old sweeper-woman she knew of. Perhaps another if need be. But the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> need have no fear of such details if he gave
her money. And this Jim Douglas had hidden in the garden of his
deserted bungalow in Duryagunj; so that, in truth, it seemed as if the
whole plan had been evolved for them by a kindly fate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301897">And yet Jim Douglas felt a keen pang of regret when, for the first
time, he gave the familiar knock of those old Lucknow days at the door
of a Delhi roof, and Tara opened it to him, dressed in the old crimson
drapery, the gold bangles restored to her beautiful brown arms. He had
brought Kate round during the previous night to the lodging he had
managed to secure in the Mufti's quarter, and leaving her there alone,
had taken the key to Tara; this being the safest plan, since
everything could then be arranged in discreet woman's fashion before
he put in an appearance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301898">And the task had been done well. The outside square or yard of
parapeted roof which he entered lay conventional to the uttermost. A
spinning-wheel here, a row of waterpots there, a mat, a reed stool or
two, a cooking place in one corner, a ragged canvas screen at the
inner doors. There was nothing to prepare him for finding an
Englishwoman within; an Englishwoman with a faint colour in her wan
cheeks, a new peace in her grey eyes, busy--Heaven save the mark!--in
sticking some disjointed jasmine buds into the shallow saucer of a
water-pot.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301899">'Tara brought them strung on a string,' said Kate
half-apologetically after her first welcome, as she noted his look. 'I
suppose she meant me to wear them--with the other things--' she paused
to glance down with a smile at her dress--'but it seemed a pity. They
were like a new world to me--like a promise--somehow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301901">He sat down on the edge of the string bed feeling a little dazed,
and looked at her and her surroundings critically. It was a pleasant
sunshiny bit of roof, vaulted by the still-cool morning sky. There was
a little arcaded room at one end,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301900" n="257 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/>
and the topmost branches of a <hi rend="italic">neem</hi> tree showed
over one side. On the other, the swelling dome of the big mosque
looked like a great white cloud, and in one corner was a sort of
square turret, from the roof of which, gained by a narrow brick
ladder, the whole city was visible; for it was the highest house in
the quarter, higher even than the roof beside it, over which the same
<hi rend="italic">neem</hi> tree cast a shadow.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301902">And as he looked, he thought idly that no dress in the world was
more graceful than the Delhi dress with its billowy train and loose,
soft, filmy veil. And Kate looked well in white--all in white. He
pulled himself up sharply; but indeed memory was playing him tricks,
and the stress and strain of reality seemed far from that slip of
sun-saturated roof where a graceful woman in white was sticking
jasmine buds into water. And suddenly the thought came that Zora would
have worn the chaplets heedlessly--there would have been no
sentimentality over withered flowers on her part.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301903">'A promise?' he echoed half-bitterly. 'Well! one must hope so. And
even if the worst comes, it will come easier here.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301904">She looked up at him reproachfully. 'Don't remind me of that,
please,' she said hurriedly; 'I seem to have forgotten--here under the
blue sky. I dare say it's very trivial of me, but I can't help
it. Everything amuses me, interests me. It is so quaint, so new. Even
this dress; it is hardly credible, but I wished so much for a
looking-glass just now, to see how I looked in it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301905">Her eyes met his almost gaily, and he felt an odd resentment in
recognising that Zora would have said the words as frankly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301906">'I have one here--in a ring,' he replied somewhat stiffly, with a
vague feeling he had done all this before, as he untied the knot of a
small bundle he had brought with him. 'It is not much use--for that
sort of thing--I'm afraid,' he went on, 'but I think you had better
have these: it is a great point--even for your own sake--to dress as
well as play the part.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301907">Kate, with a sudden gravity, looked at the pile of native ornaments
he emptied out on to the bed. Bracelets in gold and silver, anklets,
odd little jewelled tassels for the hair, quaint silk-strung necklets
and talismans.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301908" n="258 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301909">'Here is the looking-glass,' he said choosing out a tiny round one
set in filigree gold; 'you must wear it on your thumb--but it will
barely go on my little finger,' he spoke half to himself, and Kate
fitting on the ring, looked at him and set her lips.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301910">'It is too small for me also,' she said, laying it down with a
faint air of distaste. 'They are very pretty, Mr. Greyman,' she added
quickly, 'but I would rather not--unless it is really
necessary--unless you think--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301911">He rose half-wearily, half-impatiently. 'I should prefer it; but
you can do as you like. The jewels belonged to a woman I loved very
dearly, Mrs. Erlton. She was not my wife--but she was a good woman for
all that. You need not be afraid.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301912">Kate felt the blood tingle to herr face as she laid violent hands
on the first ornament she touched. It happened to be a solid gold
bangle. 'It is too small also,' she said petulantly, trying to squeeze
her hand through it. 'Really it would be better--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301913">'Excuse me,' he replied coolly, 'if you will let me.' He drew the
great carved knobs apart deftly, slipped her wrist sideways through
the opening, and had them closed again in a second.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301914">'You can't take it off at night, that is all,' he went on, 'but I
will tell Tara to show you how to wear the rest. I must be off now and
settle a thousand things.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301915">As he passed into the outer roof once more, Kate felt that flush,
half of resentment, half of shame, still on her face. In such
surroundings how trivial it was, and yet he had guessed her thought
truly. Had he guessed also the odd thrill which the touch of that gold
fetter gave her? Half-mechanically she tried to loosen it, to remove
it, and then with an impatient frown desisted and began to put on the
other bracelets. What did it matter, one way or the other? And then,
becoming interested despite herself, she set to work to puzzle out
uses and places for the pile.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301917">Meanwhile Jim Douglas was dinning instructions into Tara's ear; but
she also, he told himself angrily, was trivial to the last degree. And
when finally he urged an immediate darkening of Kate's hair and a
faint staining of the face to suit the only part possible with her
grey eyes--that of a fair Afghan--he flung away in despair from the
irrelevant remark:<pb xml:id="fswater_1301916" n="259 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/> 'But the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will never be so pretty as Zora; and besides
she has such big feet.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301918">'Big feet!' He swore under his breath that all women were alike in
this, that they saw the whole world through the medium of their sex;
and that was at the bottom of all the mischief. Delhi had been lost to
save women; the trouble had begun to please them. Even now, as far as
he could see, resistance would collapse but for one woman's ambition;
though despite the Queen and her plots, a hundred brave men or so
might still be masters of Delhi if they chose, since it was still each
for himself, and the devil take the hindmost with the mutineers. The
certainty of this had made these long days of inaction almost beyond
bearing to him; and as Jim Douglas passed out into the street he
thought bitterly that here again a woman had stood in the way; since
but for Kate, he could surely have forced Meerut into making reprisals
by reporting the true state of affairs?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301919">Yet every hour made these reprisals more difficult. Indeed, as he
left the Mufti's quarter on that morning of the 16th of May, something
was going on in the palace which ended indecision for many a man and
left no chance of retreat. For Zeenut Maihl saw facts as clearly as
Jim Douglas, and knew that the first tramp of disciplined feet would
be the signal for scuttle, if a chance of escape remained.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301920">And so this something was going on. By some one's orders of course;
by whose is one of the unanswered questions of the Indian Mutiny.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301921">The Queen herself was sitting with the King, amicably, innocently,
applauding his latest couplet; which was in sober truth, one of his
best:
<q><l>God takes this dice-box world, shakes upside down,</l><l>Throws one defeat, and one a kingly crown.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_1301923">He was beginning to feel the latter on his old head, which was so
diligently stuffed with dreams; but the Queen knew in her heart of
hearts that the fight for sovereignty had only just begun. So her mind
was chiefly occupied in a spiteful exultation at the thought of some
folk's useless terror when--this thing being done--they would find
their hands irrevocably on the plough. Ahsan-Oolah and
Elâhi-Buksh, for instance--their elaborate bridges would be

with his squibs and processions, Farkhoonda with her patter of virtue
and religion? If only for the sake of immeshing this last victim
Zeenut Maihl would not have shrunk; since those three or four days of
cozening had left the Queen with a still more vigorous hate for the
Princess Farkhoonda who had fallen into the trap so easily, and who,
already, began to give herself airs and discuss the future on a plane
of equality. Pretty, conceited fool! who even now, so the spies said,
was waiting to receive the Prince, her nephew, for the first time
since she came to the Palace. The very fact that it was the first time
seemed an aggravation in the Queen's angry eyes, proving as it did a
certain reality in Farkhoonda's pretensions to decorum.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301924">In truth they were very real to the Princess herself, and had been
gaining reality ever since that first deft suggestion of a possibility
had set her heart beating. The possibility, briefly, of the King
choosing to set aside that early marriage so tragically
interrupted--choosing to declare it no marriage and give his consent
to another. Newâsi had indignantly scouted the suggestion, had
stopped her ears, her heart; but the remembrance of it lingered,
enervating her mind, and, as she waited for the interview with the
Prince, she felt vaguely that it was a very different matter receiving
him in these bridelike garments, in these dim heavily-scented rooms,
to what it had been under the clear sky in her scholar's dress. Yet,
as she stooped from mere habit, aroused by the finery itself, to
arrange her long brocaded train into better folds, she gave something
between a sigh and a laugh at the certainty of his admiration. And
after all, why should she not have it if the King--?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301925">The sound of a distant shot made her start and pause, listening for
another. So she stood a slim figure ablaze with colour and jewels, a
figure with studied seductiveness in every detail of its dress; and
she knew that it was so. Why not? If--if he liked it so, and if the
King--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301926">Newâsi clasped her hands nervously and walked up and down
the dim room, Abool was late, and he had no right to be late on this
his first visit of ceremony to his aunt.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301928">The Mirza-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> was no doubt late, admitted
her attendants, but the door-keeper had reported a disturbance of some
kind in the outer court which might be the cause of delay. A
disturbance! Newâsi, a born coward, shrank from the very<pb xml:id="fswater_1301927" n="261 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/> thought, though she felt that it could
be nothing--nothing but one of the many brawls, the constant
quarrels--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301929">God and His prophet! who--what was that? She recoiled with a scream
of terror from the wild figure which burst in on her unceremoniously,
which followed her retreat into the far corner, flung itself at her
knees, clasping them, burying its face among her scented
draperies. But by that time her terror was gone, and she stooped
trying to free herself from those clinging arms--from the
disgrace--from the outrage--from the drunken--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301930">'Abool!' she cried fiercely, then turning to the curious tittering
women, stamped her foot at them and bade them begone. And when they
had obeyed, she beat her little hands against those clinging ones
again with wild upbraidings, till suddenly they fell as if paralysed
before the awful horror and dread in the face which rose from her
fineries.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301931">'Come, Newasi!' stammered the white trembling lips, 'come from this
hangman's den. Did I not warn thee? But thou hast put the rope round
my neck--I who only wanted to live my own life, die my own
death--Come! Come!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301932">He stumbled to his feet, but seemed unable to stir. So he stood
looking at his hands stupidly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301933">Farkhoonda looked too, her face growing grey.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301934">'What is 't, Abool?' she faltered; 'what is 't, dear?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301935">But she knew; it was blood, new shed, still wet.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301936">He stood, silent, gazing at the stains stupidly. 'I did not
strike,' he muttered to himself, 'but I called; or did I strike?
I--I--' He threw up his head and his words rushed recklessly in a high
shrill voice, 'I warned thee! I told thee it was not safe. They were
herded like sheep in the sunshine by the cistern, and the smell of
blood rose up. It was in my very nostrils, for, look you, that first
shot missed them and killed one of my men. I saw it. A round red spot
oozing over the white--and they herded like sheep--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301937">'Who?'  she asked faintly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301938">'I told thee; the prisoners, with the cry to kill above the cries
of the children, the flash of blood-dulled swords above women's
heads--and I--Nay! I warned thee, Newâsi, there was butcher <hi rend="italic">here</hi>'--his blood-stained hands left their mark on
his gay clothes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301939">'Abool!' she cried, 'thou didst not--'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301940" n="262 THE DEATH-PLEDGE"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301941">'Did I?' he almost screamed. 'God! will it ever leave my sight? I
gave the call, I ran in, I drew my sword. It purted over my hands from
a child's throat as I would have struck--or--or--did I strike?
Newâsi!' his voice had sunk again almost to a whisper, 'it was
in its mother's arms,--she did not cry--she looked and I--I--' he
buried his face in his hands--'I came to thee.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301942">She stood looking at him for a moment, her hands clenched, her
beautiful soft eyes ablaze; then recklessly she tore the jewels from
her arms, her neck, her hair--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301943">'So she has dared! Yea! Come! thou art right, Abool!' The words
mixed themselves with the tinkle of bracelets as, flung from her in
wild passion, they rolled into the corners of the room, with the chink
of necklaces as they fell, with the rustle of brocade and tinsel as
she tore them from her. 'She has killed them--the helpless fugitives,
guests who have eaten the King's salt! She thinks to beguile us
all--to beguile thee. But she shall not. It is not too late. Come!
Come! Abool--thou shalt have all from me--yea! all, sooner than she
should beguile thee thus--Come!'--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301944">She had snatched an old white veil from its peg and wrapped it
round her, as she passed rapidly to the door; but he did not move. So
she passed back again as swiftly to take his hand, stained as it was,
and lay her cheek to it caressingly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301945">'Thou didst not strike, dear, thou didst not! Come, dear, that
she-devil shall not have thee--I will hold thee fast.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301946">Five minutes after a plain curtained dhoolie left the precincts and
swayed past the Great Hall of Audience with its toothed red arches,
looking as if they yawned for victims. The courtyard beyond lay
strangely silent, despite the shifting crowd, which gathered and
melted and gathered again round the little tree-shaded cistern where
but the day before Hâfzan and the Moulvie had watched a mother
pause to clasp her baby to softer, securer rest.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301947">The woman and the child were at the cistern now, and the Rest had
come. Softer, securer than all other rest, and the mother shared it;
shared it with other women, other children.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301949">But as the Princess Farkhoonda, fearful of what she might see,
peeped through the dhoolie curtains, there was nothing<pb xml:id="fswater_1301948" n="263 PEACE! PEACE!"/> to be seen save the shifting curious crowd, while the
impartial sunshine streamed down on it, and those on whom it
gazed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301950">So let the shifting crowding years with their relentless
questioning eyes shut out all thought of what lay by the cistern, save
that of rest and the impartial sunshine streaming upon it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301951">For as the beautiful soft eyes drew back relieved, a bugle rang
through the arcades, echoed from the wall, floated out into the
city. The bugle to set watch and ward, to close the gates; since the
irrevocable step had been taken, the death-pledge made.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301952">So the dream of sovereignty began in earnest behind closed
gates. But if women had lost Delhi, those who lay murdered about the
little cistern had regained it. For Hâfzan had spoken truth;
the strength of the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> lay there.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301953">The strength of the real Master!</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0402" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II<lb/>PEACE! PEACE!</head><p xml:id="fswater_1301954">THREE weeks had passed, and still the dream of sovereignty went on
behind the closed gates, while all things shimmered and simmered in
the fierce blaze of summer sunlight. The city lay--a rose-red glare
dazzling to look at--beside the glittering curves of the river, and
the deserted Ridge, more like a lizard than ever, sweltered and slept
lazily, its tail in the cool blue water, its head upon the cool green
groves of the Subz-mundi. And over all, lay a liquid yellow heathaze
blurring every outline, till the whole seemed some vast mirage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301955">And still there was no tidings of the master, no cloud of dust upon
the Meerut road. None.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301957">Amazing, incredible fact! Men whispered of it on the steps of the
Great Mosque when, the last Friday of the fast coming round, its
commination service brought many from behind closed doors to realise
that by such signs of kingship as beatings of drums, firing of
salutes, and levying of loans,<pb xml:id="fswater_1301956" n="264 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Bahâdur Shâh really had filched the throne of
his ancestors from the finest fighters in the world. Filched it
without a blow, without a struggle, without even a threat, a
defiance.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301958">So here they were in a new world without posts or telegraphs, laws
or order; time itself turned back hundreds of years and all power of
progress vested absolutely in one old man, the Light of Religion, the
Defender of the Faith, the Great Moghul! If that were not a miracle it
came too perilously near to one for some folk's loyalty; and so they
drifted palacewards when prayers were over to swell the growing crowd
of courtiers about the Dream-King, And even the learned and most loyal
lingered on the steps to whisper, and call obscure prophecies and
ingenious commentaries to mind, and admit that it was strange,
wondrous strange, that the numerical values of the year should yield
the anagram '<hi rend="italic">Ungrez tubbah shood ba hur
soorut,</hi>' briefly '<hi rend="italic">The British shall be
annihilated.</hi>' For the Oriental mind loves such trivialities.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301959">And, to all intents and purposes, the English were annihilated,
during that short month of peace between the 11th of May and the 8th
of June 1857; for Delhi knew nothing of the vain striving, the
ceaseless efforts of the master to find tents and carriages, horses,
ammunition, medicine, everything save, thank Heaven once more!
courage, and the determination to be master still.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301960">Even Soma admitted the miracle grudgingly; for he had so far
bolstered up his disloyalty by thoughts of a fair fight. He had not,
after all, gone to Delhi direct, but had cut across country to his own
village near Hansi, and had waited there, hoping to hear of a regular
outbreak of hostilities before definitely choosing his side; and he
was still waiting when, after a fortnight, his greatest chum in the
regiment had turned up from Meerut. For Davee Singh had been one of
the many sepoys of the 11th who had gone back to the colours after
that one brief night of temptation was over. Soma had known this, and
more than once as he waited, the knowledge had been as a magnet
drawing him back to the old pole of thought; for that his chum should
be led to victory and he be among the defeated, was probable enough to
make Soma hate himself in anticipation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301962">But here was Davee Singh, a deserter like he was, sulkily
uncommunicative to the village gossips, but to his fellow<pb xml:id="fswater_1301961" n="265 PEACE! PEACE!"/> admitting fiercely that the latter had
been right. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> had forgotten how to
fight. Meerut was quiet as the grave; but there was no word of Delhi,
and folk said--What did they not say?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301963">So these two, with a strange mixture of regret and relief in their
hearts, set out for Delhi to see what was happening there; not knowing
that many of their fellows were drifting from it, weary like
themselves of inaction.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301964">They had arrived there, two swaggering Rajpoots, in the midst of
the thanksgivings and jollity of the Mohammedan Easter which followed
on the last Friday of Fast; and they had fallen foul of it frankly. As
frankly as the Mohammedans would have fallen foul of a Hindoo
Saturnalia, or both Mohammedans and Hindoos would have fallen foul of
the festivities in honour of the Queen's Birthday which, on this 25th
of May 1857, were going on in every cantonment in India as if there
were no such thing as mutiny in the world. So, annoyed with what they
saw and heard, they joined themselves to other Rajpoot malcontents
promptly. They sneered at the old pantaloon's procession--which was in
truth a poor one though half the tailors in Delhi had been impressed
to hurry up trappings and robes. Perhaps if Abool-Bukr had still been
in charge of squibs and such like, it would have been better; but he
was not. The order he had given to let the Princess Farkhoonda's
dhoolie pass out, before the gates were closed on that day of the
death-pledge, had been his last exercise of authority; for the next
Court Journal contained the announcement that he was dismissed from
his appointment. So he, hovering between the Thunbi Bazaar and the
Mufti's quarter, had nothing to do with the procession at which the
Rajpoots sneered, criticising Mirza Moghul the Commander-in-Chief's
seat on a horse, and talking boastfully of the dead heroes,
Vicra-maditya and Pertap, as warlike Hindoos will. Until, about dusk,
words came to blows amid a tinkling of anklets and a terrible smell of
musk; for valour drifted as a matter of course to the wooden balconies
of the Thunbi Bazaar during the month of miracle; so that the inmates,
coining money, called down blessings on the new <hi rend="italic">régime</hi>.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301966">Soma, however, with a cut over one eye sorely in need of a stitch,
swore loudly when he could find none to patch him up save a doddering
old <hi rend="italic">hakeem</hi>, who proposed dosing him with paper
pills inscribed with the name of Providence--an<pb xml:id="fswater_1301965" n="266 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> incredible remedy to one accustomed to all the
appliances of hospitals and skilled surgery.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301967">'Yea! no doubt hie is a fool,' assented the other sepoys in frank
commisseration, 'yet he is the best you will get. For see you,
brother, the doctors belong to the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi>; so,
many a brave man must expect to die needlessly, since those cursed
dressers are not safe. There was one took the bottles and things and
swore he could use them as well as any; and luck went with him until
he gave five heroes who had been drunk the night before somewhat to
clear their heads. By all the gods in Indra's heaven they were clear
even of life in half-an-hour! So we fell on the dresser and cleared
him too. Yea! fool or no fool, paper pills are safer!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301969">Jim Douglas, who, profiting by the dusk and confusion, had lingered
by the group after recognising Soma's voice, turned away with a savage
chuckle; not that the tale amused him, but that he was glad to think
six of the devils had gone to their account. For those long days of
peace and enforced inaction had sunk him lower and lower into sheer
animal hatred of those he dare not rebuke. He knew it himself, he felt
that his very courage was becoming ferocity, and the thought that
others--biding their time as he was--must be sinking into it also,
filled him with fierce joy at the thought of future revenge. And yet,
so far as he personally was concerned, those long days had passed
quietly, securely, peacefully, and he could at any time climb out of
all sight and sound of turmoil to a slip of sunlit roof where a woman
waited for him with confidence and welcome in her eyes; with something
obstrusively English, also, for his refreshment, since tragedy, even
the fear of death, cannot claim a whole life, and Kate took to amusing
herself once more by making her corner of the East as much like the
West as she dare. That was not much, but Jim Douglas's eye noted the
indescribable difference which the position of a reed stool, the
presence of a poor bunch of flowers, the little row of books in a
niche, made in the familiar surroundings. For there were books and to
spare in Delhi for the price of a few pennies. Jim Douglas might have
brought her a cartload of such loot had he deemed it safe; but he did
not, and so the library consisted of grammars and vocabularies from
which Kate learnt with a rapidity which surprised and interested her
teacher. In truth she had nothing else to do. Yet when he<pb xml:id="fswater_1301968" n="267 PEACE! PEACE!"/> came, as he often did, to find her
absorbed in her work, her eyes dreamy with the puzzles of tense, he
resented it inwardly, telling himself, once more, that women were
trivial creatures. And life seemed trivial too, for in truth his
nerves were all angled and out of tune with the desire to get away
from this strange shadow of a past idyll; to leave all womanhood
behind and fall to fighting manfully. So that often as he sat beside
her, patient outwardly, inwardly fretting to be gone even into the
nightmare of the city, his eye would fall on the circlet of gold he
had slipped, out of sheer arrogance and imperious temper, round that
slender wrist, and feel that somehow he had fettered himself
hopelessly when, more than a year past, he had given that promise. His
chance and hers! Was this all? One woman's safety! And she, following
his eyes to the bangle, would feel the thrill of its first touch once
more, and think how strange it was that his chance and hers were so
linked together. But, being a woman, her heart would soften
instinctively to the man who sat beside her, and whose face grew
sterner and more haggard day by day; while hers?--she could see enough
of it even in the little looking-glass on her thumb to recognise that
she was positively getting fat! She tried to amuse him by telling him
so, by telling him many of the little humorous touches which come even
into tragic life, and he was quite ready to smile at them. But only to
please her. So day by day a silence grew between them as they sat on
the inner roof, while Tara span outside, or watched them furtively
from some corner. And the flare of sunset--unseen behind the parapeted
wall--would lie on the swelling dome and spiked minarets of the
Mosque, and make the paper kites, flown in this month of May by half
the town, look like drifting jewels; fit canopy for the City of Dreams
and for this strangest of dreams upon the housetop.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301970">'Has--has anything gone wrong?' she asked in desperation one day,
when he had sat moodily silent for a longer time than usual. 'I would
rather you told me, Mr. Greyman.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301971">He looked at her vaguely surprised at the name; for he had almost
forgotten it. Forgotten utterly that she could not know any other. And
why should she? He had made the promise under that name; let them
stick to it so long as Fate linked their chances together.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301973">' Nothing; not for us at least,' he said, and then a sudden<pb xml:id="fswater_1301972" n="268 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> remorse at his own
unfriendliness came over him. 'There was another poor chap discovered
to-day;' he added in a softer tone. 'I believe that you and I,
Mrs. Erlton, must be the only two left now.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301974">'I daresay,' she echoed a little wearily, 'they--they killed him I
suppose.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301975">He nodded. 'I saw his body in the Bazaar afterwards. I used to know
him a bit--a clever sort--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301976">'Yes--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301977">'Mixed blood, of course, or he could not have passed muster so long
as a greengrocer's assistant--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301978">'Well--I would rather hear if you don't mind.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301979">His dark eyes met hers with a sudden eagerness, a sudden passion in
them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301980">'What a little thing life is after all! He only said one word--only
one. He was selling watermelons, and some brute tried to cheat first,
and then cheeked him. And he forgot a moment and said: "<hi rend="italic">Chup-raho</hi>," (be silent)--only that!--"<hi rend="italic">chup-raho</hi>"! They were bragging of it--the
devils--"<hi rend="italic">We knew he couldn't be a coolie</hi>," they
said, "<hi rend="italic">that is a master's word</hi>." My God! What
wouldn't I give to say it sometimes! I could have shouted to them
then: "<hi rend="italic">Chup-raho</hi>, you fools  you cowards!" and
some of them would have been silent enough--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301981">He broke off hurriedly, clenching his hands like a vice on each
other, as if to curb the tempest of words.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301982">'I beg your pardon,' he said after a pause, rising to walk away;
'I--I lose control--' he paused again and shook his head
silently. Kate followed him and laid her hand on his arm; the loose
gold fetter slipped to her wrist and touched him too.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301983">'You think I don't understand,' she said with a sudden sob in her
voice, 'but I do--you must go away--it isn't worth it--no woman is
worth it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301984">He turned on her sharply. 'Go? You know I can't. What is the use of
suggesting it? Mrs. Erlton! Tara is faithful, but she is faithful to
me--only to me--you must see that surely--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301985">'If you mean that she loves you--worships the very ground you tread
on,' interrupted Kate sharply, 'that is evident enough.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301986">'Is that my fault?' he began angrily; I happened--'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1301987" n="269 PEACE! PEACE!"/><p xml:id="fswater_1301988">'Thank you, I have no wish to hear the story.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301989">The commonplace, second-rate, mock-dignified phrase came to her
lips unsought, and she felt she could have cried in sheer vexation at
having used it there--in the very face of Death as it were. But Jim
Douglas laughed; laughed good-naturedly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301990">'I wonder how many years it is since I heard a woman say that? In
another world surely,' he said with quite a confidential tone. 'But
the fact remains that Tara protects you, as my wife, and if I were to
go--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301991">Kate looked at him with a quick resentment flaming up in her face
beneath the stain.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301992">'I think you are mistaken,' she said slowly, 'I believe Tara would
be better pleased if--if she knew the truth.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301993">'You mean if I were to tell her you are not my wife?' he replied
quickly. 'Why?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301994">'Because I should be less of a tie to you--because,' she paused,
then added sharply; 'Mr. Greyman, I must ask you to tell her the
truth, please. I have a right to so much, surely. I have my reasons
for it, and if you do not, I shall.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301995">Jim Douglas shrugged his shoulders. 'In that case I had better tell
her myself; not that I think it matters much one way or another, so
long as I am here. And the whole thing from beginning to end is
chance, nothing but chance.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301996">'Your chance and mine,' she murmured half to herself. It was the
first time she had alluded openly to the strange linking of their
fates, and he looked at her almost impatiently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301997">'Yes! your chance and mine; and we must make the best of it. I'll
tell her as I go out.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301998">But Tara interrupted him at the beginning.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1301999">'If the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> means that he does not love
the mem as he loved Zora, that requires no telling, and for the rest
what does it matter to this slave?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302000">'And it matters nothing to me either,' he retorted roughly, 'but of
this be sure. Who kills the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> kills me,
unless I kill first; and by Krishn, and Vishn, and the lot, I'd as
lief kill you, Tara, as any one else, if you get in my way.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302002">A great broad flash of white teeth lit up her face as she salaamed,
remarking that the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> mother must have
been as Kunti. And Jim Douglas understanding the complimentary
allusion to the God-visited mother of the Lunar<pb xml:id="fswater_1302001" n="270 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> race, wished as he went downstairs, that he was
like the Five Heroes in one respect, at least, and that was in having
only a fifth part of a woman to look after, instead of two whole ones
who talked of love! So he passed out to listen, and watch, and wait,
while the fire-balloons went up into the velvetty sky, replacing the
kites. For May is the month of marriages also, and night after night
these false stars floated out from the Dream-City to form new
constellations on the horizon for a few minutes and then disappear
with a flare into the darkness--into the darkness whence the master
did not come. Yet, as the month ended, villagers passing in with grain
from Meerut averred that the masters were not all dead, or else God
gave their ghosts a like power in cursing and smiting--which was all
poor folk had to look to; since some had appeared and burnt a
village.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302003">Not all dead? The news drifted from market to market, but if it
penetrated through the palace gates it did not filter through the new
curtains and hangings of the private apartments where the King took
perpetual cooling draughts, and wrote perpetual appeals for more
etiquette and decorum. For nothing likely to disturb the unities of
dreams was allowed within the precincts, where every day the old King
sat on a mock peacock throne with a new cushion to it, and listened
for hours to the high-flown letters of congratulation which poured in,
each with its own little covering bag of brocade, from the
neighbouring chiefs. And if, any day, there happened to be a paucity
of real ones, Hussan Askuri could supply them, like other dreams, at
so much a dozen; since nothing more costly than the brocade bag came
with them. So that the Mahboob's face, as Treasurer, grew longer and
longer over the dressmaker's and upholsterer's bills, and the Court
Journal was driven into recording the fact that some one actually
presented a bottle of <hi rend="italic">Pandamus odoratissimus</hi>
whatever that may be. Some subtle essence, mayhap, favourable to
dreaminess; since, even in the month of peace, drugs were necessary to
prevent awakening.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302004">Especially when, on the 30th of May, a sound came over the distant
horizon; the sound of artillery.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302006">At last! at last! Jim Douglas who in sheer dread of his own growing
despair had taken to spending all the time he dared in moody silence
on that peaceful roof, started as if he had been shot, and was down
the stairs seeking news.<pb xml:id="fswater_1302005" n="271 PEACE! PEACE!"/> The streets
were full of a silent, restless crowd, almost empty of soldiers. They
had gone out during the night, he learnt, Meerut-wards; tidings of an
army on the banks of the Hindu river, seven or eight miles out, having
been brought in by scouts.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302007">At last! at last! He wandered through the bazaars scarcely able to
think, wondering only when the army could possibly arrive, feeling a
mad joy in the anxious faces around him, lingering by the groups of
men collected in every open space simply for the satisfaction of
hearing the wonder and alarm in the words; 'So the master lives.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302008">He lived indeed! Listen ! That was his voice over the eastern
horizon! Kate, when he came back to the roof about noon, had never
seen him in this mood before, and wondered at his fire, his gaiety,
his youth. But the recognition brought a dull pain with it, in the
thought that this was natural to the man; that gloomy moodiness the
result of her presence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302009">'You are not afraid, surely ?' he said suddenly, breaking off in
the recital of some future event which seemed to him certain.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302010">'No. I am only glad,' she replied slowly. 'It could not have lasted
much longer. It is a great relief.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302011">'Relief,' he echoed, 'I wonder if you know the relief it is to me?'
And then he looked at her remorsefully. 'I have been an awful brute,
Mrs. Erlton, but women can scarcely understand what inaction means to
a man.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302012">Could they not? she wondered bitterly as he hastened off again,
leaving her to long weary hours of waiting, until the red flush of
sunset on the bubble dome of the mosque brought him back with a new
look on his face--a look of angry doubt.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302013">'The sepoys are coming in again,' he said, 'they claim a
victory--but that, of course, is impossible. Still I don't understand,
and it is so difficult to get any reliable information.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302014">'You should go out yourself--I believe it would be best for us
both,' replied Kate, 'Tara--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302016">He shook his head impatiently. 'Not now. What is the use of risking
all at the last. We can only have to wait till to-morrow. But I don't
understand it, all the same. The sepoys say they surprised the
camp--that the buglers were<pb xml:id="fswater_1302015" n="272 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> still calling to arms when their artillery opened fire. But
so far as I can make out they have lost five guns, and from the amount
of <hi rend="italic">bhang</hi> they are drinking, I believe it was a
rout. However, if you don't mind, I'll be off again--and--and don't be
alarmed if I stay out.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302017">'I am not in the least alarmed,' she replied. 'As I have told you
before, I don't think it is necessary you should come here at
all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302018">He paused at the door to glance back at her half-resentfully. To be
sure she did not know that he had slept on its threshhold as a rule;
but anyhow, after eating your heart out over one woman's safety for
three weeks, it was hard to be told that you were not wanted. But,
thank Heaven! the end was at hand. And yet as he lingered round the
watch-fires he heard nothing but boasting, and in more than one of the
mosques thanksgivings were being offered up; while outside the walls
volunteers to complete the task so well begun were assembling to go
forth with the dawn and kill the few remaining infidels. Some drunk
with <hi rend="italic">bhang</hi>, more intoxicated by the lust of
blood which comes with the first blow to fighting races like the
Rajpoot. It had come to Soma, as, with fierce face seamed with tears,
he told the tale again and again of his chum's gallant death. How
Davee Singh, brother in arms, his boyhood's playmate, seeing some
cowards of artillerymen abandoning a tumbril full of ammunition to the
cursed <hi rend="italic">Mlechcha's</hi>, had leapt to it like a
black-buck, and with a cry to Kali, Mother of Death, had fired his
musket into it; so sending a dozen or more of the Hell-doomed to their
place, and one more brave Rajpoot to Swarga!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302019">'<hi rend="italic">Jai! Jai! Kâli mâ ki
jai!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302020">An echo of the dead man's last cry came from many a living one, as
muskets were gripped tighter in the resolve to be no whit behind. A
few more such heroes and the Golden Age would come again; the age of
the blessed Pandâva, who forgot the cause in the quarrel.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302021">And so for one day more, Jim Douglas strained his ears for that
distant thunder on the horizon, while the people of the town, becoming
more accustomed to it, went about their business, vaguely relieved at
anything which should keep the sepoy's idle hands from mischief.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302023">The red sunset glow was on the mosque again when he<pb xml:id="fswater_1302022" n="273 PEACE! PEACE!"/> returned to the little slip of roof to find Kate
working away at her grammars calmly. It was the best thing she could
do, since every word she learnt was an additional safeguard; and yet
the man could not help a scornful smile.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302024">'It is a rout this time, I am sure,' he said; 'and yet there is no
sign of pursuit. I cannot understand it; there seems a Fate about
it!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302025">'Is that anything new?' she asked wearily, as she laid down her
book, and with the certain precision which marked all her actions, saw
that the water was really boiling before she made the tea. It was made
in a <hi rend="italic">lota</hi>, and drunk out of handleless basins,
yet for all that it was Western-made tea, strong and unspiced, with
cream to put to it also, which she skimmed from a dish set in cold
water in the coolest, darkest place she could find. It was dreamlike
indeed, and Jim Douglas, drinking his tea, felt, that with his eyes
shut, he might have dreamt himself in an English drawing-room.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302026">'Nothing new,' he retorted, 'but it seems incomprehensible. Hark!
That is a salute; for the victory, I suppose. Upon my soul I feel as
if--as if I were a dream myself--as if I should go mad! Don't look
startled--I shan't. The whole thing is a sham--I can see that. But why
has no one the pluck to give the House-of-Cards a push and bring it
about their ears? And what has become of the army at the Hindun? It
took three days to march there from Meerut, I hear--not more than
twenty-four miles. No! I cannot understand it. No wonder the people
say we are all dead. I begin to believe it myself.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302027">He certainly heard the saying often enough to bring belief during
the 1st and 2nd of June, when there was no more distant thunder on the
horizon, and the whole town, steeped and saturated with sunshine, lay
half-asleep, the soldiers drowsing off the effect of their drugs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302029">Dead? Yea! the masters were dead, and those who had escaped were in
full retreat up the river; so at least said villagers coming in with
supplies. But some one else who had come in with supplies also, sate
crouched up like a grasshopper on a great pile of wool-be-tasselled
sacks in the corn market and laughed creakily. 'Dead! not they. As the
<hi rend="italic">tanda</hi> passed Kurnal four days agone the camping
ground was white as a poppy field with tents, and the soldiers like
the flies buzzing round them. And if folk want to hear more,<pb xml:id="fswater_1302028" n="274 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> I, Tiddu,
Baharupa-Bunjâra can tell tales beyond the Kashmir Gate on the
river island where the bullocks graze.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302030">The creaking voice rose unnecessarily loud, and a man in the dress
of an Afghan who had been listening--his back to the speaker--moved
off with a surprised smile. Tiddu had proved his vaunted superiority
in this instance; though by what arts he had penetrated the back of a
disguise, Jim Douglas could not imagine. Still here was news
indeed--news which explained some of the mystery, since the seeming
retreat up the river had been, no doubt, for the purpose of joining
forces. But it was something almost better than news--it was a chance
of giving them. He had not dared, for Kate's sake, to risk any
confederate as yet; but here was one ready to hand--a confederate,
too, who would do anything for money.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302031">So that night, he sate in tamarisk shadow on the river island
talking in whispers, while the monotonous clank of the bells hung on
the wandering bullocks sounded fitfully, the flicker of the watchfires
gleamed here and there on the half-dried pools of water, the fireflies
flashed among the bushes, and every now and again a rough, rude chant
rose on the still air.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302032">'They have been there these ten days, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>,' came Tiddu's indifferent voice. 'They are
waiting for the siege train. Nigh on three thousand of them, and some
black faces besides.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302033">Jim Douglas gave an exclamation of sheer despair. To him, living in
the House-of-Cards, the Palace-of-Dreams; such caution seemed
unnecessary. Still, the past being irretrievable, the present remained
in which by hook or by crook to get the letter he had with him, ready
written, conveyed to the army at Kurnal. And Tiddu, with fifty rupees
stowed away in his waistband, being lavish of promise and confidence,
there was no more to be done save creep back to the city, feeling as
if the luck had turned at last.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302035">But the next morning he found the Thunbi bazaar in a turmoil of
talk. There were spies in the city. A letter had been found--written
in the Persian character, it is true--but with the devilish knowledge
of the West in its details of likely spots for attack, the indecision
of certain quarters in the city, its general unpreparedness for
anything like resistance. Who had written it? As the day went on the
camps were in<pb xml:id="fswater_1302034" n="275 PEACE! PEACE!"/> uproar, the palace
invaded, the dream disturbed by denouncings of Ahsan-Oolah, the giver
of composing draughts--Mahboob Ali, the checker of the purse
strings--even of Mirza Moghul, Commander-in-Chief himself, who might
well be eager to buy his recognition as heir by treachery.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302036">The net result of the letter being that, as Jim Douglas, with wrath
in his heart, crept out at dusk to the low levels by the Water
Bastion, intent on having it out with Tiddu, he could see gangs of
sepoys still at work by torchlight strengthening the bridge defence,
and had to dodge a measuring party of artillery-men busy
range-finding. His suggestions had been of use!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302037">But the old Bunjâra took his fierce reproaches
philosophically. ''Tis the miscreant Bhungi,' he assented
mournfuly. 'He is not to be trusted, but Jhungi having a tertian ague,
I deemed a surer foot advisable. Yet the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>
need not be afraid. Even the miscreant would not betray his person;
and for the rest, the Presence writes Persian like any court <hi rend="italic">moonshee</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302038">The calm assumption that personal fear was at the bottom of his
reproaches, made Jim Douglas desire to throttle the old man, and only
the certainty that he dare not risk a row prevented him from going for
the ill-gotten rupees at any rate. His thought, however, seemed read
by the old rascal, for a lean protesting hand, holding a bag,
flourished out of the darkness, and the creaking voice said
magnificently--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302039">'Before Murri-âm and the sacred <hi rend="italic">neem,
Huzoor</hi>, I have kept my bargain. As for Jhungi or Bhungi, did I
make them that I should know the evil in them? But if the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> suspects one who holds his tongue, let the
bargain between us end.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302040">His hearer could not repress a smile at the consummate cunning of
the speech. 'You can keep the money for the next job,' he said
briefly; 'I haven't done with you yet, you scoundrel.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302041">A grim chuckle came out of the shadows as the hand went back into
them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302042">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> need not fret himself, whatever
happens. The end is nigh.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302044">It seemed as if it must be with three thousand British soldiers
within sixty miles of Delhi; or less, since they might have marched
during those five days. They might be at<pb xml:id="fswater_1302043" n="276 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Delhi any moment. Three thousand men! Enough and to
spare, even though in the last few days a detachment or two of fresh
mutineers had arrived. Ah! if the blow had been struck
sooner.--If--if--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302045">Kate listened during those first days of June to many such wishes,
despairs, hopes, from one whose only solace lay in words; since with
relief staring him in the face, Jim Douglas crushed down his craving
for action. There was no real need for it, he told her; it must
involve risk, so they must wait--must sleep and dream like the
city!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302046">For, lulled by the delay, stimulated to fresh fancy by the new
comers, the townspeople went on their daily round monotonously, the
sepoys boasted and drank <hi rend="italic">bhang</hi>. And in the palace,
the king, in new robes of state, sate on his new cushion and put the
sign-manual to such trifles as a concession to a home-born slave that
he might 'continue, as heretofore, a-tinning the royal sauce-pans!'
Though Mahboob Ali's face lengthened as he doled out something on
account for faith and finery, and suggested that the army might at
least be employed in collecting revenue somewhere. But the army
grinned in the Commander-in-Chief's face, scorned laborious days,
and--between the seductions of the Thunbi bazaar--gave peaceful
citizens what one petitioner against plunder calls 'a foretaste of the
Day of Judgment.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302047">But one soul in Delhi felt in every fibre of him that the Judgment
had come--that atonement must be made.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302048">'Thou wilt kill thyself with prayers and fastings and seekings of
other folks' salvations, Moulvie-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>,' said
Hâfzan almost petulantly as, passing on her rounds, she saw
Mahomed Ismail's anxious face, seeking audience with every one in
authority, 'Thou hast done thy best. The rest is with God; and if
these find death also, the blame will lie elsewhere.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302049">'But the blame of those, woman?' he asked fiercely, pointing with
trembling finger to the little cistern shaded by the <hi rend="italic">peepul</hi> tree.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302050">Hâfzan gave a shrill laugh as she passed on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302051">'Fear not that either, learned one! This world's atonement <hi rend="italic">for that</hi>
will be sufficient for future pardon.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302053">It might be so, Mahomed Ismail told himself as he hurried off
feverishly to another appeal. He had erred in ignorance there; but
what of the forty prisoners still at the Kotwâli--forty
stubborn Christians despite their dark skins? They<pb xml:id="fswater_1302052" n="277 PEACE! PEACE!"/> were safe so far, but if the city were assaulted?--if
some of the fresh, fiery-faithed new corners?--the doubt left him no
peace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302054">'If thou wilt swear Moulvie-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi> on thine own
eternal salvation that they are Mohammedans, or stake thy soul on
their conversion,' jeered those who held the keys. A heavy stake,
that! A solemn oath with forty stubborn Christians to deal with. No
wonder Mahomed Ismail felt judgment upon him already.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302055">But the stake was staked, the oath spoken on the 6th of June. The
record of it is brief; but it stands as history in the evidence of one
of the forty. 'We were released in consequence of a Moulvie of the
name of Mahomed Ismail giving evidence that we were all Mohammedan; or
that if any were Christian they would become Mohammedan.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302056">And it was given none too soon. For on the 6th of June as the sun
set, a silhouette of a man on a horse stood clear against the red-gold
in the west, looking down from the Ridge on Delhi. Looking down on the
city bathed in the dreamy glamour of the slanting sunbeams; rose-red
and violet-shadowed, with the great white dome hovering above the
smoke wreaths, and a glitter of gold on the eastern wall, where backed
by that arcaded view of the darkening Eastern plains, an old man sate
listening to sentiments of fidelity from a pile of little brocaded
bags.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302057">It was Hodson of Hodson's Horse, reconnoitring ahead. So there was
an Englishman on the Ridge once more as the paper kites came down on
the 6th of June. But the fire balloons did not go up; for the night
set in gusty and wet, giving no chance to new constellations.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302058">Jim Douglas did not sleep at all that night, for Tiddu had brought
word that the English were at Alipore, ten miles out; and nothing but
the dread of needless risk kept him in Delhi. For any risk was
needless when, to a certainty, the English flag would be flying over
the city in a few hours.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302059">And Hodson of Hodson's Horse--back at Alipore--slept late, for he
lingered, weary and wet after his long ride, to write to his wife ere
turning in, that 'if he had had a hundred of the Guides he could have
gone right up to the city wall.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302060">But Mahomed Ismail slept peacefully, his work being over, and
dreamt of Paradise.</p></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1302061" n="278 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><div xml:id="fswater_0403" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III<lb/>THE CHALLENGE</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302062">'FOR Gawd's sake, sir! don't say I'm unfit for dooty, sir,' pleaded
a lad, who, as he stood to attention, tried hard to keep the sharp
shivers of coming ague from the doctor's keen eyes. 'I'm all right,
ain't I, mates! It ain't a bad sort o' fever at worst, as I oughter
know, havin' it constant. It's go ter hell, an' lick the blood up fust
as I'm fit for with Jack Pandy. That's all the matter--you see if it
ain't, sir!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302063">He threw his fair curly head back, his blue eyes blazed with the
coming fever light, but the bearded man next to him murmured, ''Ee's
all right, sir. 'Ee'll 'old 'is musket straight, never fear,' and the
doctor walked on with a nod.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302064">'They killed his girl at Meerut,' said his company officer in a
whisper, and Herbert Erlton standing by set his teeth and glanced
back, blue eye meeting blue eye with a sort of triumph.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302065">For it was the 7th of June, and the blow was to be struck, the
challenge given at last.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302066">Nearly a month, thought Herbert Erlton, since, it had happened. He
had spent much of the time in bed, struck down with fever; for he had
regained Meerut with difficulty, wounded and exhausted. And then it
had been too late--too late for anything save to hang round hungrily
in the hopes of that challenge to come, with many another such as
he.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302067">But it had come at last. The camp was ringing with cheers for the
final reinforcement, every soul who could stand was coming out of
hospital, and the air, new washed with rain, and cool, seemed to put
fresh life, and with it a desire to kill, into the veins of every son
of the cold North.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302069">And now the dusk was at hand. The men, half-mad with impatience,
laughed and joked over each trivial preparation. Yet, when the order
came with midnight, weapons were never gripped more firmly, more
sternly, than by those three thousand Englishmen marching to their
long-deferred chance of revenge. And some, not able to march, toiled
behind--in hopes of one fair blow; and not a few, unable even for
so<pb xml:id="fswater_1302068" n="279 THE CHALLENGE"/> much, slipped desperately from
hospital beds to see at least one murderer meet with his reward.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302070">For, to the three thousand marching upon Delhi that cool dewy
night, sent--so they told themselves--for special solace and succour
of the Right, there were but two things to be reckoned with in the
wide world. Themselves--Men. Those others--Murderers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302071">The fireflies, myriad-born from the rain, glimmered giddily in the
low marshy land, the steady stars shone over head, and Major Erlton
looked at both indifferently as he rode, long-limbed and heavy,
through the night whose soft silence was broken only by the jingle of
spurs and the squelching of light gun-wheels in water-logged ruts;
save when--from a distance--the familiar tramp, tramp, of disciplined
feet along a road came wafted on the cool wind; for the column in
which he was doing duty moved along the canal bank so as to take the
enemy, who held an entrenched position five miles from Alipore, in
flank. But Herbert Erlton was not thinking of stars or fireflies; was
not thinking of anything. He was watching for other lights, the
twinkling cresset lights which would tell where the Murderers waited
for that first blow. He did not even think of the cause of his desire;
he was absorbed in the revenge itself, and a bitter curse rose to his
lips, when just before dawn the roll of a gun and the startled flocks
of birds flying westwards told him that others were before him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302072">'Hurry up, men! For God's sake hurry up!' The entreaty passed along
the line where the troopers of the 9th Lancers were setting shoulders
to the gun-wheels, and every one--men and officers alike--was
listening with fierce regret to the continuous roll of cannon, the
casual rattle of musketry, telling that the heavy guns were bearing
the brunt of it so far.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302073">'Hurry up, men! Hurry up. That's the bridge ahead! Then we can go
for them!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302074">Hark! A silence; if silence it could be called, now that the
shouts, and yells, and confused murmur of battle could be heard. But
the guns were silent. And hark again! A ringing cheer! Bayonet work
that, at last, at last! And yonder, behind the fireflies in the
bushes?--Surely those were men in flight! Hurrah! Hurrah!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302076">When Major Erlton returned from that wild charge it was<pb xml:id="fswater_1302075" n="280 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> to find that one splendid rush
from the 75th Regiment had cleared the road to Delhi. The murderers
had been swept from their shelter, their guns--some fighting
desperately, others standing stupidly to meet death, and many with
clasped hands and vain protestations of loyalty on their lips paying
the debt of their race. But one man had paid some other debt, Heaven
knows what; and the Rifle Brigade cleared the road to Delhi of an
English deserter fighting against his old regiment.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302077">It had not taken an hour; and now, as the yellow sun peered over
the eastern horizon, a little knot of staff officers consulted what to
do next.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302078">What to do? Herbert Erlton and many another wondered stupidly what
the deuce fellows could mean by asking the question when the jagged
line of the Ridge lay not three miles off, and Delhi lay behind that?
Could any sane person think that England had done its duty at sunrise,
even though forty good men and true of the three thousand had dealt
their first and last blow?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302079">But if some did, there were not many; so, after a pause, the march
began again. Westwards, by a forking road, to the flat head of the
Lizard lying above the Subzmandi, eastward towards the tail and the
old cantonment. And this time the bayonets went with the jingling
spurs, and together they cleared the green groves merrily. Still, even
so, it was barely nine o'clock when they met the eastward column again
at Hindoo Rao's house and shook hands over their bloodless
victory. For the westward force had lost seven men, the eastward but
one; despite the fact that the retreating Murderers had attempted a
rally in their old lines.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302080">Nine o'clock! In seven hours the ten miles had been marched, the
battle of Budli-ke-serai won, and below them lay Delhi. Within twelve
hundred yards rose the Moree Bastion, the extreme western point of
that city face which, with the Kashmir gate jutting about its middle
and the Water Bastion guarding its eastern end must be the natural
target of their valour--a target three-quarters of a mile long by
twenty-four feet high.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302082">Seven hours! And the Murderers had been driven in to the city,
while the Men had gained 'twenty-six guns and the finest possible base
for the conduct of future operations.' The Ridge, the old cantonments
were once more echoing<pb xml:id="fswater_1302081" n="281 THE CHALLENGE"/> to the master's
step, and the city-folk, as they looked eagerly from the walls, had
the first notice of defeat in the smoke and flames of the sepoy lines
which the English soldiers fired in reckless revenge; reckless because
the tents were not up, and they might at least have been a shelter
from the sun.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302083">But the Delhi force, taken as a whole, was in no mood to think; and
so perhaps those at the head of it felt bound to think the more. There
was Delhi undoubtedly; but the rose-red walls with their violet
shadows looked formidable. And who could tell how many Murderers it
harboured? A thousand of them or thereabouts would return to Delhi no
more; but, even so, if all the regiments known to have mutinied and
come to Delhi were at their full strength, the odds must still be
close on four to one. And then there was the rabble, armed no doubt
from the larger magazine below the Flagstaff Tower, which, alas, had
found no Willoughby for its destruction on the 11th of May. And then
there was the May sun. And then--and then--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302084">'What's up? When are we going on?' asked Major Erlton, sitting fair
and square on his horse in the shadow of the big trees by Hindoo Rao's
house, as an orderly officer rode past him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302085">'Aren't going on to-day. Chief thinks it safer not--these native
cities--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302086">He was gone, and Herbert Erlton without a word threw himself
heavily from his horse with a clatter and jingle of swords and
scabbards and Heaven knows what of all the panoply of war; so with the
bridle over his arm he stood looking out over the bloody city which
lay quiet as the grave. Only, every now and again, a white puff of
smoke followed by a dull roar came from a bastion like a salute of
welcome to the living, or a parting honour to the dead.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302087">Was it possible? His eyes followed the familiar outline
mechanically till they rested half-unconsciously on some ruins beside
the city wall. Then with a rush memory came back to him, and as he
turned hurriedly to loosen his horse's girths, the tears seemed to
scald his tired angry eyes. Yet it was not the memory of Alice Gissing
only, which sent these unwonted visitors to Herbert Erlton's eyes; it
was a wild, desperate pity and despair for all women.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302089">And as he stood there ignoring his own emotion, or at least hiding
it, one of the women whom he pitied was look<pb xml:id="fswater_1302088" n="282 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>ing up with a certain resentful eagerness at a man,
who, from the corner turret of that roof in the Mufti's quarter, was
straining his eyes Ridge-ways.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302090">'They must rest, surely,' she said sharply; 'you cannot expect them
to be made of iron--'; as you are, she was about to add, but withheld
even that suspicion of praise.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302091">'Well! There goes the bugle to pitch tents anyhow,' retorted Jim
Douglas recklessly. 'So I suppose we had better have our breakfast
too--coffee and a rasher of bacon and a boiled egg or so. By God! its
incredible--it's--' He flung himself on a reed stool and covered his
face with his hands for a second; but he was up facing her the
next. 'I've no right to say these things--no one knows better than I
how worse than idle it is to press others to one's own tether--I
learned that lesson early, Mrs. Erlton. But'--he gave a quick gesture
of impotent impatience--'when the news first came in, the men who
brought it ran in at the Kashmir and Moree Gates in hundreds, and out
at the Ajmere and Turkoman, calling that the masters had come back;
and people were keeking round the doors hopefully. I tell you the very
boys as I came in here were talking of school again--of holiday tasks,
perhaps--Heaven knows! People were running in the streets--they will
be walking now--in another hour they will be standing; and then! Well!
I suppose the General funks the sun. So I'll be off. I only came
because I thought I had better be here in case; you see the men would
have had their blood up, rushing the city--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302092">'And your breakfast?' she asked coldly, almost sarcastically; for
he seemed to her so hard, so grudging, while her sympathies, her
enthusiasms were red-hot for the new-comers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302094">He laughed bitterly. 'I've learned to live on parched grain like a
native, if need be, and I take opium too; so I shall manage.' He was
back again to the turret, however, before two o'clock, curtly
apologetic, calmer, yet still eager. The people, to be sure, he said,
had given up keeking round their doors at every clatter, and the gates
had been closed on deserters by the palace folk; but no one had
thought of bricking them up, and after going round everywhere he
doubted if there were more than seven or eight thousand real soldiers
in Delhi. The 74th and 11th regiments had been slipping away for days,
and numbers of men who had<pb xml:id="fswater_1302093" n="283 THE CHALLENGE"/> remained did
not really mean to fight. Tiddu, who seemed to know everything, said
that the mutineers had been very strongly entrenched at Budli-serai,
so the resistance could not have been very dogged, or our troops could
not have fought their way in before nine o'clock. Yes! since she
pressed for an answer, the General might have been wise in waiting for
the cool. Only he, personally, wished he had thought it possible, for
then he would at any rate have tried to get a letter sent to the
Ridge. Now it was too late.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302095">And then suddenly, as he spoke, a fierce elation flashed to his
face again at the sound of bugles, the roll of a gun from the Moree
bastion; and he was up the stairs of the turret in a second, casting a
half-humorous, wholly deprecating glance back at her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302096">'<hi rend="italic">A hare and a tortoise once</hi>--I learned that
at school--put it into Latin!' he said lightly, as the walls round
them quivered to the reverberating rolls, thundering from the city
wall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302097">Kate walked up and down the roof restlessly, passing into the outer
one so as to be further from that eager sentinel and his
criticisms. Tara was spinning calmly, and Kate wondered if the woman
could be alive? Did she not know that brave men on both sides were
going to their deaths? And Tara, from under her heavy eyelashes,
watched Kate, and wondered how any woman who had brought Life into the
world could fear Death. Did not the Great Wheel spin unceasingly? Let
brave men, then, die bravely--even Soma. For she knew by this time
that her brother was in Delhi, and by the master's orders had dodged
his detection more than once. So the two women waited, each after her
nature; while like the pulse of time itself, the beat of artillery
shook the walls. It came so regularly that Kate, crouching in a corner
weary of restless pacing to and fro, grew almost drowsy and started at
a step beside her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302098">'A false alarm,' said Jim Douglas quietly; 'a sortie, as far as I
could judge, from the Moree; easily driven back.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302099">His tone roused her antagonism instantly. 'Perhaps they are waiting
for night.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302100">'There is a full moon--almost,' he replied; 'besides, there is fair
cover up to within four hundred yards of the Cabul Gate. They could
rush that, and a bag or two of gunpowder would finish the
business.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302101">'They could do that as well to-morrow,' she remarked hotly.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302102" n="284 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302103">'I hope to God they won't be such fools as to try it!' he replied
as hotly. 'If they don't come in to-night they will have to batter
down the walls, and then the city will go against them. What city
wouldn't? It will rouse memories we can't afford to rouse. Who could?
And every wounded man who creeps in to-day will be a centre of
resistance by to-morrow. The women will hound others on to protect
him. It is their way. You have always to allow for humanity in
war. Well! we must wait and see.' He paused and rubbed his forehead
vexedly. 'If I had known, I might have got out with the sortie; but I
suppose I couldn't really--' He paused, shrugged his shoulders, and
went out.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302104">And Kate, as she sat watching the red flush of sunset grow to the
dome, remembered his look at her with a half-angry pang. Why should
she be in this man's way always? So the day died away in soft silence,
and there on the housetop it seemed incredible that so much hung in
the balance, and that down in the streets the crowds must be drifting
to and fro restlessly. At least she supposed so. Yet, monotonous as
ever, there was the evening cry of the <hi rend="italic">Muazzim</hi>
and the persistent thrumming of <hi rend="italic">toms-toms</hi> and
<hi rend="italic">saringis</hi> which evening brings to a native
city. It rose louder than usual from a roof hard by, where, so Tara
told her, a princess of the blood royal lived; a great friend of
Abool-Bukr's. The remembrance of little Sonny's hands all red with
blood, and the cruel face smiling over an apology, made her shiver,
and wonder as she often did with a desperate craving what the child's
fate had been. Why had she let the old ayah take him? Why was he not
here, safe; making life bearable? As she sat, the tears falling
quietly over her cheeks, Tara came and looked at her curiously. 'The
<hi rend="italic">mem</hi> should not cry,' she said consolingly, 'the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> will save her somehow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302105">For an instant Kate felt as if she would rather he did not. Then on
the distance and the darkening air came a familiar sound: the evening
bugle from the Ridge with its cheerful invitation--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302106"><q>'<hi rend="italic">Come-and-set-a-picquet-boys!
come-and-keep-a-watch.</hi></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302107">So some one else was within hail, ready to help! The knowledge
brought her a vast consolation, and for the first time in that
environment she slept through the night without wakening in deadly
dreamy fear at the least sound.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302109">Even the uproarious devilry of Prince Abool in the alley<pb xml:id="fswater_1302108" n="285 THE CHALLENGE"/> below did not rouse her, when about
midnight he broke loose from the feverish detaining hold which
Newâsi had kept on him by every art in her power during the
day, lest the master returning should find the Prince in mischief. But
now he lurched away with a party of young bloods who had come to fetch
him, swearing that he must celebrate the victory properly; that but
for a moment's weakness, fostered by a foolish, fearful woman, he
night have led the cavalry. He wept maudlin tears over the thought,
swearing he would yet show his mettle. He would not leave one
Hell-doomed alive; and, suiting the action to the word, he began
incontinently to search for fugitives in some open cowyards close by,
till the strapping dairymaids, roused from slumber, declared in
revenge that they had seen a man slip down the culvert of the big
drain. Five minutes afterwards Prince Abool, half-choked,
half-drowned, was dragged from the sewer by his comrades, protesting
feebly that he must have killed an infidel; else why did the blood
smell so horribly?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302110">But after that incident the city sank into the soundlessness, the
stillness, of the hour before dawn, save for a recurring call of the
watch bugles on wall and Ridge and the twinkling lights which burned
all night in camp and court. For those two had challenged each other,
and the fight was to the bitter end. What else could it be with a
death-pledge between them? The townspeople might sleep, uncertain
which side they would espouse, but between the Men and the Murderers
the issue was clear.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302111">And it remained so, even though the month-of-miracle lingered, and
no assault came on the morrow, or the day after, or the day after
that. So that the old King himself set his back to the wall and for
once spoke as a king should. 'If the army will not fight without pay,
punish it,' he said to the Commander-in-chief. But it was only a flash
in the pan, and he retired once more to the latticed marble balcony
and set the sign-manual to a general fiat that 'those who would be
satisfied with a trifle might be paid something.' Whereat Mahboob Ali
shook his head, for there was not even a trifle in the privy
purse.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302113">As for the city people, their ears and tongues grew longer during
those three days, when the sepoys, returning from the sorties and
skirmishes, brought back tales of glorious victory, stupendous
slaughter. Her man had killed fifteen <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi><pb xml:id="fswater_1302112" n="286 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
himself, and there were not five hundred left on the Ridge, said
Futteh-deen's wife to Pera-Khan's as they gossiped at the wall; and a
good job too. When they were gone there would be an end of these
sword-cuts and bullet wounds. Not a wink of sleep had she had for
nights, yawned Zainub, what with thirsts and poultices! And on the
steps of the mosque, too, the learned lingered to discuss the
newspapers. So Bukht-Khân with 50,000 men was on his way to
swear allegiance, and the Shah of Persia had sacked Lahore, where <hi rend="italic">Jân Lârnce</hi> himself had been caught trying
to escape on an elephant and identified by wounds on his back. And the
London correspondent of the <hi rend="italic">Authentic News</hi> was
no doubt right in saying the Queen was dumbfoundered, while the
St. Petersburg one was clearly correct in asserting that the Czar was
about to put on his crown at last. Why not, since his vow regarding it
was at an end, with the passing of India from British supremacy?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302114">So the dream went on; the little brocaded bags kept coming in; the
stupendous slaughter continued.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302115">Yet every night the Widow's Cruse of a Ridge echoed to the picquet
bugles, and the court and the camp twinkled at each other till
dawn.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302116">A sort of vexed despairing patience came to Jim Douglas, and more
than once he apologised to Kate for his moodiness, like a patient who
apologises to his nurse when unfavourable symptoms set in. He gave her
what news he could glean--which was not much--for Tiddu had gone south
for another consignment of grain. But on the morning of the 12th he
turned up with a face clearer than it had been, and a friendlier look
in his eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302117">'The Guides came in to camp yesterday. Splendid fellows. They were
at it hammer and tongs immediately, though that man Rujjub Ali, I told
you of,--it was he who said Hodson was with the force--declares they
marched from Murdân in twenty-one days. Over thirty miles a
day! Well! they looked like it. I saw them ride slap up to the Cabul
Gate. And--and I saw some one else with them, Mrs. Erlton. I wasn't
sure at first if I had better tell you; but I think I had. I saw your
husband.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302119">'My husband,' she echoed faintly. In truth the past seemed to have
slipped from her. She seemed to have forgotten so much; and then
suddenly she remembered that<pb xml:id="fswater_1302118" n="287 THE CHALLENGE"/> the letter
he had written must still be in the pocket of the dress Tara had
hidden away. How strange! She must find it, and look at it again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302120">Jim Douglas watched her curiously with a quick recognition of his
own rough touch. Yet it could not be helped.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302121">'Yes. He was looking splendid, doing splendidly. I couldn't help
thinking-- Well! I wish you could have seen him; you would have been
proud'--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302122">She interrupted him with swift, appealing hand. 'Oh!don't--please
don't--what have I to do with it? Can't you see--can't you understand
he was thinking of--of <hi rend="italic">her</hi>! And doesn't she
deserve it? while I--I--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302123">It was the first break down he had seen during those long weeks of
strain, and he stood absolutely, wholly compassionate before it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302124">'My dear lady,' he said gently, as he walked away to give her time,
'if you good women would only recognise the fact which worse ones do,
that most men think of many women in their lives you would be
happier. But I doubt if Major Erlton was thinking of any one in
particular. He was thinking of the dead, and you are among them, for
<hi rend="italic">him</hi>; remember that. 'Come,' he continued,
crossing over to her again and holding out his hand. Cheer up! Aren't
you always telling me it is bad for a man to have one woman on the
brain, and think, think how many there may be to avenge by this
time!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302125">His voice, sounding a whole gamut of emotion, a whole cadence of
consolation, seemed to find an echo in her heart, and she looked up at
him gratefully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302126">It would have found one also in most hearts upon the Ridge, where
men were beginning to think with a sort of mad fury of women and
children in a hundred places to which this unchecked conflagration of
mutiny was spreading swiftly. What would become of Lucknow, Cawnpore,
Agra, if something were not done at Delhi? if the challenge so well
given were not followed up? And men elsewhere telegraphed the same
question, until, half-heartedly, the General listened, finally gave a
grudging assent, to a plan of assault urged by four subalterns.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302128">What the details were matters little. A bag of gunpowder somewhere,
with fixed bayonets to follow. A gamester's throw for sixes or
deuce-ace, so said even its supporters.<pb xml:id="fswater_1302127" n="288 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> But anything seemed better than being a target for
artillery practice five times better than their own, while the mutiny
spread around them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302129">The secret was well kept as such secrets must be. Still the
afternoon of the 12th saw a vague stir on the Ridge, and though even
the fighting men turned in to sleep, each man knew what the midnight
order meant which sent him fumbling hurriedly with belts and
buckles.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302130">'The city at last, mates! No more playin' ball,' they said to each
other as they fell in, and stood waiting the next order under the
stars; waiting with growing impatience as the minutes slipped by.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302131">'My God! where is Graves?' fumed Hodson. 'We can't go on without
him and his three hundred. Ride, some one, and see. The explosion
party is ready, the Rifles safe within three hundred yards of the
wall. The dawn will be on us in no time--Ride sharp!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302132">'Something has gone wrong,' whispered a comrade.' There were lights
in the General's tent and two mounted officers--there! I thought so!
It's all up!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302133">All up indeed! For the bugle which rang out was the retreat. Some
of those who heard it remembered a moonlight night just a month before
when it had echoed over the Meerut parade ground; and if muttered
curses could have silenced it the bugle would have sounded in
vain. But they could not, and so the men went back sulkily,
despondently to bed; back to inaction, back to target practice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302134">'Graves says he misunderstood the verbal orders, so I understand,'
palliated a staff-officer in a mess tent whither others drifted to
find solace from the chill of disappointment, the heat of anger. A
tall man with hawk's eyes and sparse red hair paused for a moment ere
passing out into the night again. 'I dislike euphemisms,' he said
curtly. 'In these days I prefer to call a spade a spade. Then you can
tell what you have to trust to.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302135">'Hodson's in a towering temper,' said an artillery man as he
watched a native servant thirstily; 'I don't wonder. Well! here's to
better luck next time.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302136">'I don't believe there will be a next time,' echoed a lad
gloomily. And there was not, <hi rend="italic">for him</hi>, the target practice settling
that point definitely next day.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302138">'But why the devil couldn't--' began another vexed voice,<pb xml:id="fswater_1302137" n="289 THE CHALLENGE"/> then paused 'Ah! here comes Erlton from
the General. He'll know. I say, Major--' he broke off aghast.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302139">'Have a glass of something, Erlton!' put in a senior hastily 'you
look as if you had seen a ghost, man!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302140">The Major gave an odd hollow laugh. 'The other way on--I mean--I--I
can't believe it--but my wife--she--she's alive--she's in Delhi.' The
startled faces around seemed too much for him; he sat down hurriedly
and hid his face in his hands, only to look up in a second more
collectedly, 'It has brought the whole d----d business home, somehow,
to have her there.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302141">'But how?'--The eager voices got so far--no further.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302142">'I nearly shot him--should have if he had not ducked, for the get
up was perfect. Some of you may know the man--Douglas--Greyman--a
trainer chap, but, by God! a well-plucked one. He sneaked into my tent
to tell. But I don't understand it yet, and he said he would come back
and arrange. It was all so hurried, you see; I was due at the muster,
and he was off, when he heard what was up, to see Graves--whom he
knows. Oh curse the whole lot of them! Here, <hi rend="italic">khansâman</hi>! brandy--anything!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302143">He gulped it down fiercely, for he had heard of more than life from
Jim Douglas.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302145">The latter meanwhile was racing down a ravine as his shortest way
back to the city. His getting out had been the merest chance,
depending on his finding Soma as sentry at the sally-port of the
ruined magazine. He had instantly risked the danger of another
confederate for the opportunity, and he was just telling himself with
a triumph of gladness that he had been right, when a curious sound
like the rustling of dry leaves at his very feet, made him spring into
the air and cross the flat shelf of rock he was passing at a bound;
for he knew what the noise meant. A true lover's knot of deadly viper,
angry at intrusion, lay there; the dry Ridge swarms with them. But, as
he came down lightly on his feet again, something slipped from under
one of them, and though he did not fall, he knew in a second that he
was crippled; break or sprain, he knew instantly that he could not
hope to reach the sally-port before Soma's watch was up. Yet he must
get back to the city; for <hi rend="italic">this</hi>--he had tried a
step by this time with the aid of a projecting rock--might make it
impossible to return for days if he did the easiest<pb xml:id="fswater_1302144" n="290 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
thing and crawled upwards again on hands and knees. That, then, was
not to be thought of. The Ajmere gate, however, <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be open for traffic; the Delhi one certainly
was, morning and evening. The latter meant a round of nearly four
miles, and endless danger of discovery; but it must be done. So he set
his face westwards.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302146">It was just twenty-four hours after this, that Tara, unable for
longer patience, told Kate that she must lock herself in, while she
went out to seek news of the master. Something must have happened. It
was thirty-six hours since they had seen him, and if he was gone, that
was an end.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302147">Her face as she spoke was fierce, but Kate did not seem to care;
she had in truth almost ceased to care for her own safety except for
the sake of the man who had taken so much trouble about it. So she sat
down quietly, resolved to open the locked door no more. They might
break it in if they chose, or she could starve. What did it
matter?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302148">Tara meanwhile went, naturally, to seek Soma's aid--all other
considerations fading before the master's safety; and so, of course,
came instantly on the clue she sought. He had left the city, let out
by Soma's own hands; hands which had never meant to let him in
again--that being a different affair. And though he had said he would
return, why should he? asked Soma. Whereupon Tara, to prove her ground
for fear, told of the hidden <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>. She would
have told anything for the sake of the master. And Soma looked at her
fierce face apprehensively.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302149">'That is for afterwards!' she said curtly, impatiently. 'Now, we
must make sure he is not wounded. There was fighting to-day. Come,
thou can'st give the password and we can search before dawn if we take
a light. That is the first thing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302150">But as, cresset in hand, Tara stooped over many a huddled heap or
long, still, stretch of limb, Kate, with a beating heart, was
listening to the sound of some one on the stairs. The next moment she
had flung the door wide at the first hint of the familiar knock.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302151">'Where is Tara?' asked Jim Douglas, peremptorily, still holding to
the door jamb for support.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302152">'She went--to look for you--we thought--what has happened?--what is
the matter?' she faltered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302154">'Fool! as if that would do any good! Nothing's the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302153" n="291 THE CHALLENGE"/> matter, Mrs. Erlton. I hurt my ankle, that's all.' He
tried to step over the threshold as he spoke, but even that short
pause from sheer dogged effort, had made its renewal an agony, and he
put out his hand to her blindly. 'I shall have to ask you to help
me--' he began, then paused. Her arm was round him in a second, but he
stood still, looking up at her curiously, 'To--to help--' he
repeated. Then she had to drag him forward by main force so that he
might fall clear of the door, and enable her to close it swiftly; for
who could tell what lay behind?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302155">One thing was certain. That hand on her arm had almost scorched
her--the ankle he had spoken of must have been agony to move. Yet
there was nothing to be done save lay cold water to it, and to his
burning head, settle him as best she could on a pillow and quilt as he
lay, and then sit beside him waiting for Tara to return; for Tara
could bring what was wanted.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302156">But if Tara was never to return? Kate sat, listening to the heavy
breathing broken by half-delirious moans, while the stars dipped and
the grey of dawn grew to that dominant bubble of the mosque; and, as
she sat, a thousand wild schemes to help this man--who had helped her
for so long--passed through her brain, filling her with a certain
gladness; until in the early dawn Tara's voice, calling on her, stole
through the door.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302157">It was still so dark that Kate, opening it with the quick cry--'He
is here, Tara, he is here safe!' did not see the tall figure standing
behind the woman's, did not see the menace of either face, did not see
Tara's quick thrust of a hand backwards as if to check some one
behind.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302158">So she never knew that Jim Douglas, helpless, unconscious, had yet
stepped once more between her and death; for Tara was on her knees
beside the prostrate figure in a second, and Soma, closing the door
carefully, salaamed to Kate with a look of relief in his handsome
face. This settled the doubtful duty of denouncing hidden <hi rend="italic">Mlechchas</hi>. How could that be done in a house where
the master lay sick?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302159">And he lay sick for days and weeks, fighting against sun-fever and
inflammation, against the general strain of that past month of
inaction, which, as Kate found with a pulse of soft pity, had
sprinkled the hair about his temples with grey.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302160" n="292 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302161">'He would die but for her,' said Tara gloomily, grudgingly, 'so she
must live, Soma--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302162">'Nay! 'twas not I--' began her brother, then held his peace,
doubtful if the disavowal was to his praise or blame; for duty was a
puzzle to most folks in those hot lingering days of June when the
Ridge and the City skirmished with each other and wondered mutually if
anything were gained by it. Yet both Men and Murderers were cheerful,
and Major Erlton going to see the hospital after that fifteen hours
fight of the 23rd of June, when the centenary of Plassey, a Hindoo
fast, and a Mahomedan festival, made the sepoys come out to certain
victory in full parade uniform with all their medals on, heard the lad
whose girl had been killed at Meerut say in an aggrieved tone, 'and
the nigger as stuck me 'ad 'er Majesty's scarlet coatee on 'is d----d
carcase, and a 'eap of medals she give him a blazin' on his
breast--dash 'is impudence.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302163">So blue eye met blue eye again sympathetically; for that was no
time to see the pathos of the story.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0404" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV<lb/>BUGLES AND FIFES</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302164">THERE was a blessed coolness in the air, for the rains had broken,
the molten heats of June had passed. And still that handful of
obstinate aliens clung like barnacles to the bare red rocks of the
Ridge. Clung all the closer because in one corner of it, beside the
canal, they had become part of the soil itself in rows on rows of
new-made graves. A strong rear-guard this, what with disease and
exposure superadded to skirmishes and target-practice. Yet, though not
a gun in the city had been silenced, not a battery advanced a yard,
the living garrison day after day dug these earthworks for the dead
one, firm as it in silent resolve to yield no inch of foothold on
those rocks until the Judgment Day, when Men and Murderers should pass
together to the great settlement of this world's quarrels.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302166">And yet those in command began to look at each other, and ask what
the end was to be; for though, despite the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302165" n="293 BUGLES AND FIFES"/> daily drain, the widow's cruse grew in numbers as time went
on, the city grew also, portentously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302167">Still the men were cheerful, the Ridge strangely unlike a war-camp
in some ways; for the country to the rear was peaceful, posts came
every day, and there was no lack even of luxuries. Grain merchants,
deserting their city shops, set up amid the surer payments of the
cantonment bazaar, and greed of gain brought hawkers of fruit, milk,
and vegetables to run the gauntlet of the guns; while some poor folk
living on their wits, when there was not a rag or a patch or a bit of
wood left to be looted in the deserted bungalows, took to earning
pennies by tracking the big shot as they trundled in the ravines, and
bringing them to the masters who had need of them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302168">Between the rain-showers too, men, after the manner of Englishmen,
began to talk of football matches, sky races, and bewail the fact of
the racquet court being within range of walls. But some, like Major
Reid--who never left his post at Hindoo Rao's house for three
months--preferred to face the city always; to watch it as a cat
watches a mouse to whom she means to deal death by and by. Herbert
Erlton was one of these, and so the old khânsaman with whom
Kate used to quarrel over his terribly Oriental ideas of Irish stew
and such like--would bring him his lunch, sometimes his dinner, to the
picquets. It was quite a dignified procession, with a cook-boy
carrying a brazier, so that the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> food
should be hot, and the <hi rend="italic">bhisti</hi> carrying a porous
pot of water holding bottles, so that the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> drink might be cool. The
khânsanan--a wizened figure with many yards of waistband
swathed round his middle--leading the way with the mint sauce for the
lamb, or the mustard for the beefsteak. He used at first to mumble
charms and vows for safe passage as he crossed the Valley of the
Shadow--as a dip where round shot loved to dance was nicknamed by the
men; but so many others of his trade were bringing cool drinks and hot
food to the master that he soon grew callous to the danger, and
grinned like the rest when a wild caper to dodge a trundling
thundering ball made a fair-haired laddie remark sardonically to the
caperer, 'It's well for you, my boy, that you haven't spilt my
dinner!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302170">Perhaps it was, considering the temper of the times. Herbert
Erlton, eating his lunch, sheltered from the pelting<pb xml:id="fswater_1302169" n="294 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> rain behind the low scarp which by this time
scored the summit of the Ridge, smiled also. He was all grimed and
smirched with helping young Light--the gayest dancer in Upper
India--with his guns. He helped wherever he could in his spare time,
for a great restlessness came over him when out of sight of those
rose-red walls; they had a fascination for him since Jim Douglas'
failure to return had left him uncertain what they held. So, when the
day's work slackened, as it always did towards sunset, and--the rain
clearing--he had drifted back to his tent for a bath and a change, he
drifted out again along the central road, where those off duty were
lounging, and the sick had their beds set out for the sake of company
and cooler air. It was a quieter company than usual, for some two days
before, the General himself had joined the rear-guard by the canal
struck down by cholera, and dying with the half-conscious, wholly
pathetic words on his lips, 'Strengthen the Right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302171">And that very day the auctions of his and other dead comrade's
effects had been held; so that more than one usually thoughtless
youngster looked down, maybe, on a pair of shoes into which he had
stepped over a grave.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302172">Still it was an eager company, as it discussed Lieut. Hill's'
exploit of the morning, and asked for the latest bulletin of that
reckless young fighter with fists against the swords.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302173">'How was it?' asked the Major, 'I only heard the row. The beggars
must have got clean into camp.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302174">'Right up to the artillery lines. You see it was so beastly misty
and rainy, and they were dressed like the native vidette. So Hills,
thinking them friends, let them pass his two guns, until they began
charging the Carabineers; and then it was too late to stop 'em.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302175">'Why?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302176">'Carabineers--didn't stand, somehow--except their officer. So Hills
charged instead. By George! I'd have given a fiver to see him do it!
You know what a little chap he is--a boy to look at. And then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302177">'And then' interrupted the doctor who had been giving a glance at a
ticklish bandage as he passed the bed round which the speakers had
gathered, 'I think I can tell you in his own words; for he was quite
cool and collected when they brought him in--said it was from bleeding
so much about the head--'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302178" n="295 BUGLES AND FIFES"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302179">A ripple of mirth ran through the listeners, but Major Erlton did
not smile this time; the laugh was too tender.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302180">'He said he thought if he charged it would be a diversion, and give
time to load up. So he rode--Yes! I should like to have seen it
too!--slap at the front rank, cut down the first fellow, slashed the
next over the face. Then the two following crashed into him, and down
he went at such a pace that he only got a slice to his jacket and lay
snug till the troop--a hundred and fifty or so--rode over
him. Then--ha--ha! he got up and looked for his sword! Had just found
it ten yards off, when three of them turned back for him. He dropped
one from his horse, dodged the other who had a lance, and finally
gashed him over the head. Number three was on foot--the man he'd
dropped, he thinks, at first--and they had a regular set to. Then
Hills' cloak, soaked with rain, got round his throat and half-choked
him, and the brute managed to disarm him. So he had to go for him with
his fists, and by punching merrily at his head managed all right till
he tripped over his cloak and fell--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302181">'And then,' put in another voice eagerly, 'Tombs, his Major, who
had been running from his tent through the thick of those charging
devils, on foot, to see what was up that the Carabineers should be
retiring, saw him lying on the ground, took a pot shot a thirty
paces--and dropped his man!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302182">'By George, what luck!' commented some one; 'he must have been
blown!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302183">'Accustomed to turnips, I should say,' remarked another, with a
curiously even voice; the voice of one with a lump in his throat, and
a slight difficulty in keeping steady.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302184">'Did they kill the lot?' asked Major Erlton quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302185">'Bungled it rather, but it was all right in the end. They were a
plucky set, though; charged to the very middle of the camp, shouting
to the black artillery to join them--to come back with them to
Delhi!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302187">'But they met with a pluckier lot!' interrupted the man who had
suggested turnips. 'The black company wasn't ready for action. The
white one behind it was; unlimbered, loaded. And the blackies knew
it. So they called out to fire--fire at once--fire sharp--fire through
them--Well! d--n it all, black or white I don't care, it's as plucky a
thing as has been done yet--' he moved away, his hands in his<pb xml:id="fswater_1302186" n="296 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> pockets, attempting a whistle;
perhaps to hide his trembling lips.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302188">'I agree,' said the doctor gravely 'though it wasn't necessary to
take them at their word. But somehow it makes that mistake afterwards
all the worse.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302189">'How many of the poor beggars were killed doctor,' asked an uneasy
voice in the pause which followed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302190">'Twenty or so. Grass-cutters and such like. They were hiding in the
cemetery from the troopers--who were slashing at every one; and our
men pursuing the party which escaped over the canal bridge--made--made
a mistake. And--I'm sorry to say there was a woman--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302191">'There have been too many mistakes of that sort,' said an older
voice breaking the silence, 'I wish to God some of us would think a
bit. What would our lives be without our servants, who, let us
remember, outnumber us by ten to one? If they weren't faithful--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302192">'Not quite so many, Colonel,' remarked the doctor with a nod of
approval. 'Twenty families came to the brigade-major to-day with their
bundles, and told him they preferred the quiet of home to the
distraction of camp. I don't wonder--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302193">'It is all their own fault,' broke in an angry young voice, 'Why
did they--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302194">And so began one of the arguments, so common in camp, as to the
right of revenge pure and simple; arguments fostered by the
newspapers, where, every day, letters appeared from 'Spartacus,' or
'Fiat Justitia,' or some such <hi rend="italic">nom de
plume</hi>. Letters all alike in one thing, that they quoted texts of
Scripture; notably one about a daughter of Babylon and the blessedness
of throwing children on stones.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302196">But Major Erlton did not stop to listen to it. The ethics of the
question did not interest him, and in truth mere revenge was lost in
him in the desire, not so much to kill, as to fight. To go on hacking
and hewing forever and ever. As he drifted on, smoking his cigar, he
thought quite kindly of the poor devils of grass-cutters who really
worked uncommonly well; just, in fact, as if nothing had happened. So
did the old khânsaman, and the sweeper who had come back to him
on his return to the Ridge, saying that the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> would find the tale of chickens
complete. And the garden of the ruined house near the Flagstaff Tower
whither<pb xml:id="fswater_1302195" n="297 BUGLES AND FIFES"/> his feet led him
unconsciously--as they often did of an evening--was kept tidy. The
gardener--when he saw the tall figure approaching--going over to a
rose-bush, which, now that the rain had fallen was new budding with
white buds, and picking him a buttonhole. He sat down on the plinth of
the verandah twiddling it idly in his fingers as he looked out over
the panorama of the eastern plains, the curving river, and the city
with the white dome of the mosque hanging unsupported above the smoke
and mist wreaths. For now, at sunsetting, the sky was a mass of
rose-red and violet cloud and a white steam rose from the dripping
trees and the moist ground. It was a perfect picture. But he only saw
the city. That, to him, was India. That filled his eye. The wide
plains east and west, north and south--where the recent rain had
driven every thought save one of a harvest to come, from the minds of
millions--where the master meant simply the claimer of revenue--might
have been non-existent so far as he, and his like, were concerned.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302197">Yet even for the city he had no definite conception. He merely
looked at, it idly, then at the rosebud he held. And that reminding
him of a certain white marble cross with 'Thy will be done' on it, he
rose suddenly, almost impatiently. But there was no resignation in <hi rend="italic">his</hi> face, as he wandered towards the batteries again with the white flower
of a blameless life stuck in his old flannel coat, and a strange
conglomerate of pity and passion in his heart; while the city--as the
light faded--grew more and more like the clouds above it, rose-red and
purple; until, in the distance, it seemed indeed a City of Dreams.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302199">In truth it was so still, despite the clangour of bugles and fifes
which Bukht Khân brought with him when, on the 1st of July, he
crossed the swollen river in boats with five thousand mutineers. A
square broad-shouldered man was Bukht Khân, with abroad face
and massive beard; a massive sonorous voice also, to match. A man of
the Cromwell type, of the church militant, disciplinarian to the
back-bone, believing in drill; yet with an eye to a Providence above
platoon exercise. And there was no lack of soldiers to drill in Delhi
by this time. They came in squads and battalions, to jostle each other
in the streets and overflow into the camp on the southern side of the
city--that furthest from the obstinate colony on the Ridge! But first
they flung themselves against it in all<pb xml:id="fswater_1302198" n="298 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> the ardour of new brooms, and failing to sweep the
barnacles away, subsided into the general state of dreaminess and
drugs. For the bugles and fifes could always be disobeyed, on the plea
that they were not sounded by the right Commander-in-Chief. There were
three of them now. Bukht Khân the Queen's nominee, Mirza
Moghul, and another son of the king's, Khair Sultân. So that
Abool-Bukr's maudlin regrets for possible office became acute, and
Newâsi's despairing hold on his hand had to gain strength from
every influence she could bring to bear upon it. Even drunkenness and
debauchery were safer than intrigue, in view of that vision of
retribution which seemed to have left him, and taken to haunting her
day and night. So she held him fast, and when he was not there wept
and prayed, and listened hollow-eyed to a Moulvie who preached at the
neighbouring mosque; a man who preached a judgment.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302200">'Thou art losing thy looks, mine Aunt,' said the Prince to her one
day; not unkindly; on the contrary, almost tenderly. 'Dost know,
Newâsi, thou art more woman than most, for thou dost brave all
things, even loss of good name--for I swear even these Mufti folk
complain of thee <hi rend="italic">for nothing</hi>. None other I know would do it; and so I
would not have it done <hi rend="italic">for something</hi>. Yet some day we shall quarrel
over it; some day thy patience will go; some day thou wilt be as
others, thinking of thyself; and then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302201">'And then, nephew?' she asked coldly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302202">He laughed, mimicking her tone. 'And then I shall grow tired and go
mine own way to mine own end.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302204">In the meantime, however, the thrummings and drummings went on
until Kate Erlton, watching a sick bed hard by, felt as if she must
send round and beg for quiet. It seemed quite natural she should do
so, for she was completely absorbed over that patient of hers, who,
without being seriously ill, would not get better; who passed from one
relapse of fever to another with a listless impatience, and now,
nearly a month after he had stumbled over the threshold, lay barely
convalescent. It had been a strange month. Stranger even than the
previous one, when she had dragged through the lonely days as best she
could, and he had wandered in and out restlessly, full of strain and
stress. If even that had been a curious linking of their fates, what
was this when she tended him day and night, when the weeks slipped<pb xml:id="fswater_1302203" n="299 BUGLES AND FIFES"/>
by securely, almost ignorantly? For though Soma came every day to
inquire after the master--standing at the door to salute to her, spick
and span in full uniform--he brought no disturbing news.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302205">It seemed to her, now, that she had known Jim Douglas all his
life. And in truth she had learnt something of the real man during the
few days of delirium consequent on the violent inflammation which set
in on the injured ankle. But for the most part he had muttered and
moaned in liquid Persian. He had always spoken it with Zora, who had
been taught it as part of her attractions, and, no doubt, the jingle
of the jewels as Kate tended him, brought reminiscence of that
particular part of his life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302206">By the time he came to himself, however, she had removed all the
fineries, finding them in the way; save the heavy gold bangle which
would not come off at least not without help. He used to watch it
half-confusedly, at first, as it slipped up and down her arm, and
wonder why she had not asked Tara to take it off for her; but he grew
rather to like the look of it; to fancy that she had kept it on
purpose; to be glad that she had--though it was distinctly hard when
she raised him up on his pillows!--for, after all, fate linked them
strangely, and he was grateful to her--very grateful.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302207">'You are laughing at me,' she said one morning as she came up to
his bed, with a tray improvised out of a brass platter, and found him
smiling.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302208">'I have been laughing at you all the morning, when I haven't been
grumbling,' he replied, 'at you and the chicken-tea, and that little
fringed business, to do duty as a napkin, I suppose, and the
fly-paper--which isn't the least use, by the way, and I'm sure I could
make a better one--and the mosquito net to give additional protection
to my beauty when I fall asleep. Who could help laughing at it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302209">She looked at him reproachfully. 'But it makes you more comfortable
surely?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302210">'Comfortable,' he echoed, 'my dear lady! It is a perfect
convalescent home!' But, in the silence which followed, his right hand
clenched itself over a fold in the quilt unmistakably.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302212">'If you will take your chicken-tea,' she replied cheerfully,
despite a faint tremble in her voice. 'You will soon get out of
it. And really, Mr. Greyman, you don't seem to have lost<pb xml:id="fswater_1302211" n="300 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> any chance. Soma is not very
communicative, but everything seems as it was. I never keep back
anything from you. But, indeed, the chief thing in the city seems that
there is no money to pay the soldiers. Do you know, I'm afraid Soma
must <hi rend="italic">loot</hi> the shops like the others. He seems to get things for
nothing; though of course they are extraordinarily cheap. When I was a
<hi rend="italic">mem</hi> I used to pay twice as much for eggs.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302213">He interrupted her with a laugh that had a tinge of bitterness in
it, 'Do you happen to know the story of the Jew who was eating ham
during a thunderstorm, Mrs. Erlton--?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302214">She shook her head, smiling, being accustomed by this time to his
unsparing, rather reckless ridicule.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302215">'--He looked up and said, 'All this fush about a little bit of
pork.' So all this fuss has taught you the price of eggs! Upon my
word! it is worse than the convalescent home!' He lay back on his
pillows with a half-irritated weariness.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302216">'I've learned more than that, surely'--she began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302217">'Learned!' he echoed sharply, 'You've learned everything, my dear
lady, necessary to salvation. That's the worst of it! You chatter to
Tara--I hear you when you think I'm asleep. You draw your veil over
your face when the water-carrier comes to fill the pots as if you had
been born on a housetop. You...Mrs. Erlton!--if I were not a helpless
idiot I could pass you out of the city tomorrow, I believe. It isn't
your fault any longer. It's mine, and Heaven only knows how long--Oh!
confound that thrumming and drumming. It gets on my nerves--<hi rend="italic">my nerves</hi>!--pshaw!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302218">It was then that Kate declared that she would really send
Tara--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302219">'Mrs. Erlton presents her compliments to the Princess Farkhoonda
Zamâni, and will be obliged,' jested Jim Douglas; then paused,
in truth more irritated than amused, despite the humour on his
face. And suddenly he appealed to her almost pitifully, 'Mrs. Erlton!
if any one had told you it would be like this--your chance and
mine--when the world outside us was alive--was struggling for
life--would you--would you have believed it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302221">She bent to push the chicken tea to a securer position. 'No,' she
said softly; then to change the subject, added, 'How white your hands
are getting again! I must put some more stain on them, I suppose.' She
spoke regretfully,<pb xml:id="fswater_1302220" n="301 BUGLES AND FIFES"/> though she did
not mind putting it on to her own. But he looked at the whiteness with
distinct distaste.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302222">'It is with doing nothing and lying like a log. Well! I suppose I
shall wake from the dream some day, and then the moment I can
walk--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302223">'There will be an end of peace,' she interrupted, quite
resolutely. 'I know it is very hard for you to lie still, but really
you must see how much safer and smoother life has been since you were
forced to give in to Fate--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302224">'--And Kate--' he muttered crossly under his breath. But she heard
it, and bit her lip to prevent a tender smile as she went off to give
an order to Tara; for the vein of almost boyish mischief and
lighthearted recklessness which showed in him at times, always made
her think how charming he must have been before the cloud shadowed his
life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302225">'The master is much better to-day, Tara,' she said cheerfully, 'I
really think the fever has gone for good.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302226">'Then he will soon be able to take the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>
away,' replied the woman quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302227">'Are you in such a hurry to get rid of me?' asked Kate with a
smile, for she had grown fond of the tall stately creature with her
solemn airs of duty, and absolute disregard of anything which came in
its way. The intensity of the emotion which swept over the face, which
was usually calm as a bronze statue, startled Kate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302228">'Of a truth I shall be glad to go back. The life of the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> is not my life, their death not my
death.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302229">It was as if the woman's whole nature had recoiled, as one might
recoil from a snake in the path, and a chill struck to Kate Erlton's
heart, as she realised on how frail a foundation peace and security
rested. A look, a word, might bring death. It seemed to her incredible
that she should have forgotten this, but she had. She had almost
forgotten that they were living in a beleagured city, though the
reverberating roll of artillery, the rush and roar of shells, and the
crackle of musketry never ceased for more than a few hours at a
time.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302231">She was not alone, however, in her forgetfulness. Half Delhi had
become accustomed to cannon, to bugles and fifes, and went on its
daily round indifferently. But in the palace the dream grew ominously
thin once or twice. For not a fraction remained in the Treasury, no
effort to collect revenue had been made anywhere, and fat Mahboob, the
only man<pb xml:id="fswater_1302230" n="302 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> who knew how to
screw money out of a stone, lay dying of dropsy. And as he lay--the
mists of personal interest in the future dispersing--he told his old
master the king some home truths privately, while Ahsan-Oolah the
physician, administering cooling draughts as usual, added his wisdom
to the eunuch's. There was no hope where there was no money. Life was
not worth living without a regular pension. Let the king secure his,
and secure pardon while there was yet time, by sending a letter to the
General on the Ridge, and offering to let the English in by Selimgarh
and betray the city. When all was said and done, others had betrayed
him, had forced his hand; so let him save himself if he could,
quietly, without a word to any but Ahsan-Oolah. Above all, not a word
to Zeenut Maihl, Hussan Askuri, and Bukht Khân--that Trinity of
Dreams!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302232">With which words of wisdom mayhap lightening his load of sins, the
fat eunuch left the court once and for all. So the old king, as he sat
listening to the quarrels of his commander-in-chief, had other
consolation besides couplets; and when he wrote--
<q><l>'No peace, no rest, since armies round me riot</l><l>Life lingers yet, but ere long I shall die 'ot.'</l></q>
--he knew--though his yellow, wax-like mask hid the knowledge from
all--that a chance of escape remained.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302234">The old king's letter reached the Ridge easily. (There was no
difficulty in communication now. Spies were plentiful, and if Jim
Douglas had been able to get about, he could have set Major Erlton's
mind at rest without delay; but Soma positively refused to be a
go-between--to do anything, in short, save secure the master's
safety). And the offer of betrayal arrived, when the man who held
command of the Ridge felt uncertain of the future; all the more so
because of the telegrams, the letters--almost the orders--which came
pouring in to take Delhi--to take it at once! Early in the month, the
Gamester's-throw of Assault had been revived with the arrival of
reinforcements, only to be abandoned once more, within an hour of the
appointed time, in favour of the Grip-of-Death. But now, though the
whisper had gone no further than the general's tent, a third
possibility was allowed--Retreat. The six thousand were dwindling day
by<pb xml:id="fswater_1302233" n="303 BUGLES AND FIFES"/> day, the men were half-dead with
picquet duty, wearied out with needless skirmishes, crushed by the
tyranny of bugles and fifes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302235">If this betrayal, then, could be? There was no lack of desire to
believe it possible; but Greathed of the politicals, and Sir
Theophilus Metcalfe shook their heads doubtfully. Hodson, they said,
had better be consulted. So the tall man with the blue hawk's eyes,
who had lost his temper many times since that dawn of the 12th of
June, when the first assault had hung fire, was asked for his
opinion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302236">'We had a chance at the beginning,' he said. 'We could have a
chance now, if there was some one who...but that is beside the
question. As for <hi rend="italic">this</hi>, it is not worth the
paper it is written on. The king has no power to fulfil his
promise. He is virtually a prisoner himself. That is the truth. But
don't send an answer. Refer it, and keep him quiet.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302237">'And retreat?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302238">'Retreat is impossible, sir. It would lose us India.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302239">'Any news, Hodson?' asked Major Erlton, meeting the free-lance as
he rode back to his tent after his fashion, with loose rein and loose
seat, unkemp, undeviating, with an eye for any and every
advantage.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302240">'None.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302241">Any chance of--of anything?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302242">'None with our present chiefs. If we had Sir Henry Lawrence here it
would be different.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302243">But Sir Henry Lawrence, having done his duty to the uttermost,
already lay dead in the residency at Lucknow, though the tidings had
not reached the Ridge. And still more direful tidings were on their
way to bring July, that month of clouds and cholera, of flies and
funerals, of endless buglings and fifings--to a close.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302244">It came to the city first. Came one afternoon when the king sat in
the private Hall of Audience, his back towards the arcaded view of the
eastern plains ablaze with sunlight, his face towards the garden,
which, through the marble mosaic-traced arches, showed like an
embroidered curtain of green, set with jewelled flowers. Above him on
the roof circled the boastful legend--
<q><l>'If earth holds a haven of bliss</l><l>It is this--it is this--it is this.'</l></q></p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302245" n="304 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302246">And all around him, in due order of precedence, according to the
latest army lists procurable in Delhi, were ranged the mutinous native
officers--since half the king's sovereignty showed itself in
punctilious etiquette. At his feet, below the peacock throne stood a
gilded cage containing a cockatoo. For Hâfzan had been so far
right in her estimate of Hussan Askuri's wonders that poor little
Sonny's pet, duly caught, and with its crest dyed an orthodox green,
had been used--like the stuffed lizard--to play on the old man's love
of the marvellous. So, for the time being, the bird followed him in
his brief journeyings from audience-hall to balcony, from balcony to
bed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302247">The usual pile of brocaded bags lay below that again upon the
marble floor, where a reader crouched, sampling the most loyal to be
used as a sedative; for one would be needed ere long, since the
Commanders-in-Chief were at war They, Bukht Khân backed by
Hussan Askuri stood apart; and all the puritans and fanatics of the
city; Mirza Moghul by his brother Khair Sultân, and most of the
Northern Indian rebels who refused a mere <hi rend="italic">ex-soubadar's</hi> right to be better than they.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302248">'Let the Light-of-the-World choose between us,' came the sonorous
voice almost indifferently; in truth those secret counsels of Bukht
Khân with the Queen--of which the palace, was big with
gossip--held small place, allowed small consideration for the puppet
King.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302249">'Yea! let the Pillar-of-State choose,' bawled the shrill voice of
the Moghul, whose yellow, small-featured face was ablaze with
passion. 'Choose between his son and heir and this low born upstart,
this <hi rend="italic">soubadar</hi> of artillery, this puritan by
profession, this debaucher of King's--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302250">He paused, for Bukht Khân's hand was on his sword, and there
was an ominous stir behind Hussan Askuri. Ahsan-Oolah, a discreet
figure in black standing by the side of the throne, craned his long
neck forward, and his crafty face wore an amused smile.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302251">Bukht Khân laughed disdainfully at the Mirza's full
stop. 'What I am, sire, matters little if I can lead armies to
victory. The Mirza hath not led his, <hi rend="italic">as
yet</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302252">'Not led them?' interrupted an officious peace-bringer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302254">'Lo! the hell-doomed are reduced to five hundred; the colonels are
eating their horse's grain, the captains are<pb xml:id="fswater_1302253" n="305 BUGLES AND FIFES"/> starving, and our shells cause terror as they cry "Coffin!
coffin!" (<hi rend="italic">boccus! boccus!</hi>)--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302255">'The Mirza could do as well as thou,' put in a partisan heedless of
the tales--to which the King, however, had been nodding his head--'if,
as thou hast, he had money to pay his troops. The Begum Zeenut Maihl's
hoards--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302256">The sword and the hand kept company again significantly. 'I pay my
men by the hoard I took from the infidel, Meean-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>,' retorted the loud, indifferent voice. 'And
when it is done I can get more. The palace is not sucked dry yet, nor
Delhi either.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302257">The Meean, well-known to have feathered his nest bravely, muttered
something inaudible, but a stout, white-robed gentleman bleated
hastily--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302258">'There is no more money to be loaned in Delhi, be the interest ever
so high.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302259">The broad face broadened with a sardonic smile. 'I borrow,
banker-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>, according to the tenets of the
faith--without interest! For the rest, five minutes in thy house with
a spade and a string bed to hang thee on head down, and I pay every
fighter-for-the-faith in Delhi his arrears!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302260">'<hi rend="italic">Wâh! Wâh!</hi>' A fierce murmur of
approval ran round the audience, for all liked that way of dealing
with folk who kept their money to themselves.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302261">'But, Khân-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>! there is no such
hurry,' protested the keeper of peace, the promoter of dreams. 'The
Hell-doomed are at the last gasp. Have not two Commanders-in-Chief had
to commit suicide before their troops? And was not the third allowed
by special favour of the Queen to go away and do it privately? This
one will have to do it also, and then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302262">'And a letter has but this day come in,' said a grave, clever
looking man, interrupting the tale once more, 'offering ten lakhs; but
as the writer makes stipulations, we are asking what treasury he means
to loot, or if it is hidden hoards.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302264">Bukht Khân shrugged his shoulders. 'The Meean's or the
banker's hoards are nearer,' he said brutally, 'and money we must
have, if we are to fight as soldiers. Otherwise--' He paused. There
was a stir at the entrance, where a newsrunner had unceremoniously
pushed his way in to flourish a letter in a long envelope, and
pant--with vehement show of<pb xml:id="fswater_1302263" n="306 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> breathlessness.--'In haste! In haste! and <hi rend="italic">buksheesh</hi> for the bringer.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302265">The King, who had been listening wearily to the dispute, thinking
possibly that the paucity of Commanders on the Ridge was preferable to
the plethora of them at court, looked up indifferently. They came so
often, these bearers of wonderful news; not so often as the little
brocaded bags; but they had no more effect.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302266">'Reward him, Keeper-of-the-Purse,' he said punctiliously, 'and
read, slave. It is some victory to our troops, no doubt.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302267">There was a pause, during which people waited indifferently,
wondering, some of them, if it was bogus news that was to come or
not.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302268">Then the Court <hi rend="italic">moonshee</hi> stood up with a
doubtful face. ''Tis from Cawnpore,' he murmured, forgetting decorum
and etiquette; forgetting everything save the news that the
Nâna of Bithoor had killed the two hundred women and children
he had pledged himself to save.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302269">Bukht Khân's hand went to his sword once more, as he
listened, and he turned hastily to Hussan Askuri. 'That settles it as
<hi rend="italic">thou</hi> wouldst have it,' he whispered. 'It is
Holy War, indeed, or defeat.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302270">But Mirza Moghul shrank as a man shrinks from the scaffold.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302271">The old King stood up quickly; stood up between the lights looking
out on the curtain of flowers. 'Whatever happens,' he said
tremulously, 'happens by the will of God.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302272">His sanctimoniousness never failed him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302273">So on the night of the 23rd of August there was an unwonted
stillness in the city, and the coming of day did not break it. The
rain, it is true, fell in torrents, but many an attack had been made
in rain before. There was none now. The bugles and fifes had ended,
and folk were waiting for the drum ecclesiastic to begin. What they
thought, meanwhile, who knows? Delhi held a hundred and fifty thousand
souls, swelled to nigh two hundred thousand by soldiers; only this,
therefore, is certain, that the thoughts must have been diverse.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302275">But on the Ridge, when, after a few days, the tidings of Cawnpore
reached it with certainty, there was but one opinion. It found
expression in a letter which the General wrote on the last day of
July. 'It is my firm intention to hold my<pb xml:id="fswater_1302274" n="307 THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC"/> present position and resist attack to the last. The
enemy are very numerous, and may possibly break through our
entrenchments and overwhelm us, but the force will die at its
post.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302276">There were no talk of retirement now! The millions of peasants
ploughing their land peaceably in firm faith of a just master who
would take no more than his due, the thousands--even in the bloody
city itself--waiting for this tyranny to pass, were not to be
deserted. The fight would go on. The fight for law and order.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302277">So the sanctimonious old king had said sooth, 'Whatever happens,
happens by the will of God.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302278">Those two hundred had not died in vain.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0405" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V<lb/>THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302279">THE silence of the city had lasted for seven days. And now, on the
1st of August, the dawn was at hand, and the rain which had been
falling all night had ceased, leaving pools of water about the city
walls. Still, smooth pools like plates of steel, dimly reflecting the
grey misty sky against which the minarets of the mosque showed as
darker streaks, its dome like a faint cloud.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302280">And suddenly the silence ended. The first shuddering beat of a
royal salute vibrated through the heavy, dewy air, the first chord of
'God save the Queen,' played by every band in Delhi floated
Ridgewards.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302281">The cheek of it!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302282">That phrase--no other, less trenchant, more refined--expressed
purely the feeling with which the roused six thousand listened from
picquet or tent, comfortable bed or damp sentry-go, to this
topsy-turveydom of anthems! The cheek of it! The very walls ought to
fall Jericho-wise before such sacrilegious music.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302283">But in the city it sent a thrill through hearts and brains. For it
roused many a dreamer who had never felt the chill of a sword-hilt on
his palm to the knowledge that the time for gripping one had come.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302285">Since this was Bukr-eed, the Great Day of Sacrifice. No<pb xml:id="fswater_1302284" n="308 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> common Bukr-eed either, when
the blood of a goat or a bull would worthily commemorate Abraham's
sacrifice of his best and dearest, but something more akin to the old
patriarch's devotion. Since on Bukr-eed, 1857, the infidel was to be
sacrificed by the faithful, and the faithful by the infidel.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302286">For the silence of seven days had been a silence only from bugles
and fifes; the drum ecclesiastic had taken their place. The mosques
had resounded day and night to the wild tirades of preachers, and even
Mahomet Ismail--feeling that in religious war lay the only chance of
forgiveness for past horrors--spent every hour in painting its
perfections, in deprecating any deviation from its rule; the sword or
the faith for men who fought; the faith, without the sword, for those
who could not fight. But others were less scrupulous, their
denunciations less guarded. So, as the processions passed through the
narrow streets flaunting the green banner, half the Mohammedan
population felt that the time had come to strike their blow for the
faith without restriction; and Hussan Askuri dreamt dreams; and the
Bird-of-Heaven--with its crest new-dyed for the occasion--gave the
Great Cry viciously as it was paraded through jostling crowds in the
Thunbi Bazaar, where religion found recruits by the score, even among
the women. Abool-Bukr, vaguely impressed by the stir, the colour, the
noise, took to the green and swore to live cleanly; so that
Newâsi's soft eyes shone as she repeated Mahomed Ismail's
theories. They were very true, the Prince said; besides this could be
nothing but honest fighting since there were no women on the Ridge;
whereupon she stitched away at his green banner fearlessly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302287">But in the Palace it needed all Bukht Khân's determination
and Hussan Askuri's wily dreams to reconcile the old King to the
breach of etiquette which the sacrifice of a camel, instead of a bull,
by the royal hands involved; for the army--three-quarters Brahmin and
Rajpoot--had been promised, as a reward for helping to drive out the
infidel, that no sacred kine should be killed in Hindustan.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302288">And others besides the King objected to the restriction. Old
Fâtma, for instance, Shumsh-a-deen the seal-cutter's wife, as
she swathed her husband's white beard with pounded henna leaves to
give it the orthodox red dye.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302290">'What matters it, woman?' he replied sternly, but with an odd
quaver in his voice. 'There is a greater sacrifice than the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302289" n="309 THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC"/> blood of bulls and goats, and that
I may yet offer this blessed Eed.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302291">'And mayhap, mother,' suggested the widowed, childless
daughter-in-law, 'a goat will serve our turn better than a stirk this
year: there will be enough for offering, and belike there may be no
feasting.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302292">The old lady, high-featured, high-tempered, wept profusely between
her railings at the ill-omened suggestion; but the old Turk admitted
the possibility, with a strained wondering look in the eyes which had
lost their keenness with graving texts. So, as the day passed, the
women helped him faithfully in his bath of purification, and the
daughter-in-law, having the steadiest hand, put the antimony into the
old man eyes as he squatted on a clean white cloth stretched in the
centre of the odd little courtyard. She used the stylus she had
brought with her to the house as a bride, and it woke past memories in
the old brain, making the black-edged old eyes look at the wife of his
youth with a wistful tenderness. For it was years since a woman had
performed the kindly office--not since the finery and folly of life
had passed into the next generation's hands. But old Fâtma
thought he still looked as handsome as any as he finally stepped into
the streets in his baggy trousers, with one green shawl twisted into a
voluminous waistband, another into a turban, his flaming red beard
flowing over his white tunic, and a curved scimitar--it was rather
difficult to get out of its scabbard by reason of rust--at his
side.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302293">'Lo! here comes old Fâtma's Shumsha-deen,' whispered other
women peeping through other chinks. 'He looks well for sure; better by
far than Murriam's Faiz-Ahmud for all his new gold shoes!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302294">And those two, daughter and mother-in-law, huddled in unaccustomed
embrace to see the last of their martyr through the only convenient
crack, felt a glow of pitiful pride before they fell a-weeping and
a-praying the old pitiful prayer of quarrellers that God would be good
to His own.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302296">There were thousands in Delhi about sunsetting on the 1st of August
who were praying that prayer, though there were hundreds who held
aloof, talking learnedly of the '<hi rend="italic">House of Protection</hi>' as distinguished
from the '<hi rend="italic">House of the Enemy</hi>,' as they listened to the distinguished
call to prayer. How could there be Holy War, when <hi rend="italic">that</hi> had echoed
freely during the British<pb xml:id="fswater_1302295" n="310 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
rule? And Mahomed Ismail, listening to their arguments feverishly,
knew in his heart that they were right.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302297">But the old 'Shumsha-deens' did not split hairs. So, as the sun
set, they went forth in thousands and the gates were closed behind
them; for they were to conquer or die. They were to hurl themselves
recklessly on the low breast-works which now furrowed the long line of
hill; above all, on that which had crept down its side to a ruined
temple within seven hundred yards of the Moree bastion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302298">So, about the rising of the moon, two days from full, began such a
cannonading and fusillading as was not surpassed even on that final
day when the Ridge, taking similar heart of grace, was to fling itself
against the city.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302299">Major Erlton, off duty but on pleasure in the Sammy-house
breastwork, said to his neighbour that they must be mad, as a confused
wild rush burst from the Moree gate; six thousand or so of soldiers,
and 'Shumsha-deens,' with elephants, camels, field-pieces, distinct in
the mixed mirk and moonlight! And behind them came a hail of shell and
shot, with them a rain of grape and musket-balls. But above all the
din and rattle could be heard two things. The cries of the <hi rend="italic">Muazzims</hi> from the minarets, chanting to the four
corners of earth and sky that 'Glory is for all and Heaven for those
who bleed'; and an incessant bugling.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302300">'It's that man in front,' remarked Major Erlton. 'Do you think we
shall manage, Reid? There's an awful lot of them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302301">Major Reid looked round on his little garrison of dark faces--for
there was not an Englishman in the post; only a hundred quaint squat
Ghoorkas, and fifty tall fair Guides from the Western frontier--'We'll
do for just now, and I can send for the Rifles by-and-by. There's to
be no pursuit, you know. The order's out. Ought to have been out long
ago. Reserve your fire, men, till they come close up.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302302">And come close they did, while Walidâd-Khân, fierce
fanatic from Peshawur, and Gorakh-nâth, fiercer Buddhist from
Nepâl, with fingers on trigger, called on them jibingly to come closer
still--though twenty yards from a breastwork bristling with rifles was
surely close enough for any one!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302303">But it was not for the bugler who led the van, sounding assemblies,
advances, doubles--anything which might stir the hearts
behind.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302304" n="311 THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302305">'He has got a magnificent pair of bellows,' remarked an officer,
who, after a time, came down with a hundred and fifty of the Rifles to
aid that hundred and fifty natives in holding the post against six
thousand and more of their countrymen.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302306">'Splendid! he has been at it this hour or more,' said Major
Erlton. 'I really think they are mad. They don't seem to aim or to
care. There they are again!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302307">It was darker now, and Walidâd-Khân from Peshawur and
Gorakh-nâth from Nepal, and Bill Atkins from Lambeth had to
listen for that tootling of assemblies and advances to tell them when
to fire blindly from the embrasures into the smoke and the roar and
the rattle. So they fell to wondering among themselves if they had
nicked the bugler that time. Once or twice the silence seemed to say
they had; but after a bit the tootling began again, and a disappointed
pair of eyes peeping curiously, recklessly, would see a dim figure
running madly to the assault again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302308">'Plucky devil!' muttered Major Erlton as, with the loan of a rifle,
he had his try. There was a look of hope on dark faces and white alike
as they cuddled down to the rifle stocks and came up to listen. It was
like shooting into a herd of does for the one royal head--and some of
the sportsmen had tempers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302309">'<hi rend="italic">Shaitân-ke-butcha!</hi> (Child of the
devil),' muttered Walidâd-Khân, whereat
Gorakh-nâth grinned from ear to ear.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302310">'Wot cher laughin' at?' asked Bill Atkins, who had been indulging
in language of his own, 'a feller can't 'it ghosts. An' 'ee's the
piper as played afore Moses; that's what 'ee is.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302311">'Look sharp, men!' came the officer's warning. 'There's a new lot
coming on. Wait, and let them have it!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302312">They did. The din was terrific. The incessant flashes lighting up
the city, showed its roofs crowded with the families of absent
'Shumsha-deens'; so High Heaven must have been assailed, indeed, that
night.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302314">And even when dawn came it brought no Sabbath calm; only a fresh
batch of martyrs. But they had no bugler. For with the dawn, some
fierce frontiersman, jesting Cockney, or grinning Ghoorkha may have
risked his life for a fair shot, in daylight, at the piper who played
before Moses; anyhow, he played no more. Perhaps the lack of him,
perhaps the torrents of rain which began to fall as the sun rose,
quenched<pb xml:id="fswater_1302313" n="312 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> the fires of
faith. Anyhow, by nine o'clock the din was over, the drum ecclesiastic
ceased to beat, and the English, going out to count the dead, found
the bugler lying close to the breastwork, his bugle still in his
hand--a nameless hero save for that passing jest. But some one in the
city no doubt mourned the piper who played before Moses, as they
mourned other martyrs; more than a thousand of them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302315">Yet the Ridge, despite the faith, and fury, and fusillading, had
only to dig one grave; for fourteen hours of what the records call
'unusual intrepidity'--(contemptuously cool equivalent for all that
faith and fury)--had only killed <hi rend="italic">one
infidel</hi>.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302316">Shumsha-deen's Fâtma, however, was as proud as if he had
killed a hundred; for he had bled profusely for the faith, having been
at the very outset of it all kicked by a camel and sent flying on to a
rock to dream confused dreams of valour till the bleeding from his
nose relieved the slight concussion of his brain, and enabled him to
go home, much shaken, but none the worse. But many hundreds of women
never saw their Shumsha-deens again, or if they saw them, only saw
something to weep over and bind in white swaddling clothes and gold
thread.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302317">So by dark on the 2nd of August the sound of wailing women rose
from every alley, and the men, wandering restlessly about the bazaars,
listened to the sound of tattoo from the Ridge and looked at each
other almost startled.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302318">'<hi rend="italic">Go-to-bed-Tom! Go-to-bed-Tom!
Drunk-or-sober-go-to-bed-Tom!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302319">The Day of Sacrifice was over, and Tom was going to bed quietly as
if nothing had happened! They did not know that three-quarters of the
Toms had been in bed the night before, undisturbed by the martyrs'
supreme effort; if they had, they might have wondered still more
persistently what Providence was about.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302320">But in the big Mosque, among the great white bars of moonlight
slanting beneath the dome, one man knew. He stood, a tall white figure
beneath a furled green banner, his arms outspread, his voice rising in
fierce denunciation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302322">'Cursed<ref target="#fswatern312">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern312" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">From a contemporaneous account.</note> be

past and ye would not believe. I tell it again that ye may know. It
was dawn. And the Lord Christ and the Lord Mohammed sat over the World
striving, each for His own, according to the Will of the Most High,
who sets men's quarrels before the Saints in Heaven with a commander
to each side. And I saw the Lord Christ weep, knowing that justice was
on ours. So the fiat for victory went forth, and I slept. But I
dreamed again and lo! it was eve with a blood-red sunsetting
westwards. And the Lord Christ wept still, but the Lord Mahommed's
voice rang loud and stern. "Reverse the fiat. Give the victory to the
women and the children." So I woke. And it is true! is true! Cursed be
they who killed <hi rend="italic">jehad</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302323">The voice died away among the arches where, in delicate tracery,
the attributes of the Great Creator were cut into changeless marble;
Truth, Justice, Mercy,--all the virtues from which all religions make
their God.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302324">'He is mad,' said some; but for the most part men were silent as
they drifted down the great flights of steps to the city leaving
Mahomed Ismail alone under the dome.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302325">'Didst expect otherwise, my Queen?' said Bukht Khân
hardily. 'So did not I! But the end is gained. Delhi was not ours in
heart and soul before. It is now. When the assault comes those who
fought for faith will fight for their skins. And at the worst there is
Lucknow for good Sheeahs, like the Queen and her slave. We have no tie
here among these Sunnies who think only of their hoards.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302326">Zeenut Maihl shrank from him with her first touch of fear, for she
had eight or nine lakhs of rupees hidden in that very house, and this
man whom she had summoned to her aid bid fair to make flight necessary
even for a woman. Had she ventured too much? Was there yet time to
throw him over, to throw every one over and make her peace? She turned
instinctively in her thoughts to one who loved money also, who also
had hoards to save; and so, within half-an-hour of Bukht Khân's
departure, Ahsan-Oolah was closeted with the Queen, who, after the
excitement of the day, needed a cooling draught.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302328">Most people in the Palace needed one that night, for by this time
almost all the possible permutations of confederacy had come about,
with the result that--each combination's intrigue being known to the
next--a general distrust had<pb xml:id="fswater_1302327" n="314 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> fallen upon all. In addition, there was now a fourth
Commander-in-chief; one Ghaus-Khân, from Neemuch, who declared
the rest were fools.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302329">In truth the Dream was wearing thin indeed within the Palace!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302330">But on that peaceful little housetop in the Mufti's quarter it
seemed more profound than ever; it seemed as if Fate was determined to
leave nothing wanting to the strange unreal life that was being lived
in the very heart of the city. Jim Douglas was almost himself again. A
little lame, a little uncertain still of his own strength; and so,
remembering a piece of advice given him by the old Baharupa never to
attempt using the Gift when <hi rend="italic">he</hi> was not strong
enough for <hi rend="italic">it</hi> to be strong, he had been patient
beyond Kate's hopes. But on this 2nd of August, after lying awake all
night listening to the roar and the din, he had insisted on going out
when Soma did not turn up as usual to bring the news. He would not be
long, he said--not more than an hour or two--and the attempt must be
made some time; at no better one than now, perchance, since folk would
be occupied in their own affairs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302331">'Besides,' he added with a smile, 'I'm ready to allow the
convalescent home its due. While I've been kept quiet the very thought
of concealed Europeans has died out.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302332">'I don't know!' she interrupted quickly. 'It isn't long since
Prince Abool-Bukr chased that blue-eyed boy of the Mufti's over the
roofs thinking he was one--don't you remember I was so afraid he might
climb up here?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302333">'That's the advantage of being up-top,' he replied lightly. Now, if
anything were to happen, <hi rend="italic">you</hi> could scramble down. But the Prince was
drunk, and I won't go near his haunts--there isn't any danger--really
there isn't!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302334">'I shall have to get accustomed to it even if there is,' she
replied in the same tone. Jim Douglas paused at the door
irresolutely--'Shall I wait till Tara returns?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302335">'No, please don't. She is not coming back till late. She grows
restless if she does not go--and I am all right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302337">In truth Tara had been growing restless of late. Kate, looking up
from the game of chess--at which her convalescent gave her half the
pieces on the board and then beat her easily--used to find those dark
eyes watching them furtively. Zora Begum had never played <hi rend="italic">shatrïnj</hi> with the master, had<pb xml:id="fswater_1302336" n="315 THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC"/> never read with him from books, had never
treated him as an equal. And, strangely enough, the familiar
companionship--inevitable under the circumstances--roused her jealousy
more than the love-making on that other terraced roof had done. <hi rend="italic">That</hi>
she understood. <hi rend="italic">That</hi> she could crush with her
cry of <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. But <hi rend="italic">this</hi>--this which to her real devotion seemed so
utterly desirable--what did it mean? So she crept away, when she
could, to take up the saintly role as the only certain solace she knew
for the ache in her heart.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302338">Therefore Kate sat alone, darning Jim Douglas's white socks--which
as a better-class Afghan he was bound to wear --and thinking as she
did so how incredibly domestic a task it was! Still socks had to be
darned, and with Tara at hand to buy odds and ends, and Soma with his
knowledge of the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> life ready to bring
chess-boards, and soap, and even a book or two, it seemed as if the
roof would soon be a very fair imitation of home. So she sat
peacefully; till, about dusk, hearing a footfall on the stairs halting
with long pauses between the steps, her vexation at her patient's
evident fatigue overcame her usual caution; and without waiting for
his signal knock she set the door wide and stepped out on to the
stairs to give him a hand if need be. And then out of the shadow of
the narrow brick ladder came a strange voice panting breathlessly:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302339">'<hi rend="italic">Salaam! mem-sahib</hi>.' She started back, but
not in time to prevent a bent figure with a bundle on its back from
stumbling past her on to the roof; where, as if exhausted, it leant
against the wall before slipping the bundle to the floor. It was an
ordinary brown blanket bundle full of uncarded cotton, and the old
woman who carried it was ragged and feeble; emaciated too beyond
belief, as if cotton-spinning had not been able to keep soul and body
comfortably together. Not a very formidable foe this--if foe it
was. Why! surely she knew the face--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302340">'I have brought Sonny back, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>,' came
the breathless voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302341">Sonny! Kate Erlton gave a little cry. She recollected now. 'O
ayah!' she began recklessly, 'what? where is he--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302343">The old woman stumbled to the door, closed the catch and then leant
exhausted upon the lintel, sinking down slowly to a squatting
position, her hand upon her heart. There<pb xml:id="fswater_1302342" n="316 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> was more in this than the fatigue of the stairs, Kate
recognised.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302344">'He is in the bundle, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> did not know me. She will know the <hi rend="italic">baba</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302345">Know him! As her almost incredulous fingers fumbled at the knots,
her mind was busy with an adorable vision of white embroideries,
golden curls, and kissable, dimpled milk and roses. So it was no
wonder that she recoiled from the ragged shift and dark skin, the
black close-cropped hair shaved horribly into a wide gangway from nape
to forehead.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302346">'O ayah!' she cried reproachfully, 'what have you done to Sonny <hi rend="italic">baba</hi>!' For Sonny it was unmistakably, in the guise
of a street urchin. A foolish remark, to make doubtless, but the old
Mai, most of whose life had been passed in the curling of golden
curls, the prinking of mother's darlings, did not think it
strange. She looked wistfully at her charge, then at Kate
apologetically.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302347">'It was safer, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. And at least he is
fat and fresh. I gave him milk and <hi rend="italic">chikken-brât.<ref target="#fswatern316">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern316" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">Chicken broth.</note>
And it was but a tiny morsel of opium just to make him quiet in the
bundle.'</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302348">Something in the quavering old voice made Kate cross quickly to the
old woman and kneel beside her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302349">'You have done splendidly, ayah, no one could have done
better!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302350">But the interest had died from the haggard face. 'They said folk
would be damned for it,' she muttered half to herself, 'but what could
I do? The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>, my <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>,
said "take care of the boy." So I gave him <hi rend="italic">chikken-brât</hi> and milk.' She paused, then
looked up at Kate slowly. 'But I can grind and spin no more, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. My life is done. So I have brought him
here--and--' she paused again for breath.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302351">'How did you find me out?' asked Kate, longing to give the old
woman some restorative, yet not daring to offer it; for she was a
Mussulmâni.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302353">The old Mai reached out a skeleton of a hand, half-mechanically, to
flick away a fluff of cotton wool from the still sleeping child's
face. 'It was the <hi rend="italic">chikken-brât,
Huzoor</hi>. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> will remember the old
mess <hi rend="italic">khansaman</hi>? He did the <hi rend="italic">pagul khanas</hi> (picnics) and <hi rend="italic">nautches</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>
logue. A big man with gold lace who made the cake at Christmas<pb xml:id="fswater_1302352" n="317 THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC"/> for the <hi rend="italic">babas</hi> and set fire to plum-puddeens as no other <hi rend="italic">khansaman</hi> did. And made <hi rend="italic">estârfit</hi> turkeys and <hi rend="italic">sassets</hi> (stuffed turkey and sausages)--and--' She
seemed afloat on a Bagh-o-bahâr list of comestibles--a dream of
days when, as ayah, she had watched many a big dinner go from the
cook-room.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302354">'But about the <hi rend="italic">chikken-brât</hi>, ayah?'
asked Kate with a lump in her throat; for the wasted figure babbling
of old days was evidently close on death.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302355">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>! Mungul Khân keeps life in
him, these hard times, with the selling of eggs and fowls. So he,
knowing me, said there was more <hi rend="italic">chikken-brât</hi> than mine being made in the
quarter. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> need have no fear. Mungul
weeps every day and prays the <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi> may
return, because his last months' account was not paid. A sweeper
woman, he said, bought "halflings," saying they were for an Afghan's
<hi rend="italic">bibi</hi>. As if an Afghani would use three
halflings in one day! No one but a <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> making
<hi rend="italic">chikken-brât</hi> would do that. So I watched
and made sure, against this day; for I was old, and I had not spun or
ground for so long.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302356">'You should have come before,' said Kate gently. 'You have worn
yourself out.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302357">The old woman stumbled to her feet. 'My life was worn before, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. I am very old. I have put many boy-babies
into the <hi rend="italic">mem's</hi> arms to make them forget their
pain, and taken them from them to put the flowers round them when they
were dead. He was safer with me speaking our language; with you he may
remember. But I shall be dead, so I can do no more.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302358">'Wait, do wait till the <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> returns,'
pleaded Kate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302359">The Mai paused, her hand on the latch. 'What have I to do with the
<hi rend="italic">sahibs, Huzoor</hi>? Mine were not much count. They
made my <hi rend="italic">mems</hi> cry, or laugh; cry first, then
laugh. It is bad for <hi rend="italic">mems</hi>. But my <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> did not care, she only cared for the babies and
so there was always a flower for the grave. Matadeen, the gardener,
made it, and the big <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>--Erlton <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302360">She ceased suddenly, and went mumbling down the stairs leaving Kate
to close the door again and drop on her knees beside the sleeping
child. Was he sleeping or had the opium...? She gave a sigh of relief
as--her hair tickling his cheek as she bent to listen--up came a
chubby unconscious hand to brush the tickle away.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302361" n="318 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302362">Sonny! It seemed incredible to her thought. The house would be a
home indeed with his sweet 'Miffis Erlton' echoing through it. No!
what the old Mai had said was true. There would be danger in English
prattle. She must not tell him who she was. He must be kept as safe as
that other child over across the seas whose empty place this one had
partly filled--that other child who in all these storms and stress
was, thank Heaven! so safe. She must deny herself that pleasure, and
be content with this terribly-disfigured Sonny. Then she wondered if
the dye came off as hers did; so with wet finger began trying the
experiment on the child's cheek. A little; but perhaps soap and warm
water might--She gathered Sonny in her arms and went over to the
cooking-place. And there, to her unreasoning delight, after a space,
was a square inch or so of milk and roses. It was trivial, of course;
Mr. Greyman would say womanish, but she should like to see the real
Sonny just once! She could dye him again. So, with the sleeping child
on her lap, she began soft dabbings and wipings on the forehead and
cheeks. It was a fascinating task and she forgot everything else,
till, as she began work on the nose, what with the tickling and the
tepid bathings dispelling the opium drowsiness, Sonny woke, and
finding himself in strange arms began to scream horribly. And there
she was, forgetful of caution amongst other things, kissing and
cuddling the frightened child, asking him if he didn't know her and
telling him he was a good little Sonnikins whom nobody in the world
would hurt! At which juncture, with brain started in a new-old groove,
he said amid lingering sobs:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302363">'O Miffis Erlton! What <hi rend="italic">has</hi> a-come of my
polly?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302364">She recognised her slip in a second; but it was too late. And hark!
There were steps on the stair, and Sonny was prattling on in his high,
clear lisp! Not one step, but two--and voices--a visitor no
doubt. Sometimes, to avoid suspicion, it was necessary to bring them
in. She knew the routine. The modest claim for seclusion to her
supposed husband in Persian, the leaving of the door on the latch, the
swift retreat into the inner roof during the interval decorously
allowed for such escape. All this was easy without Sonny. The only
chance now was to stop his prattle, even by force, give the excuse
that other women were within, and trust to a man's quickness
outside.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302365" n="319 THE DRUM ECCLESIASTIC"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302366">Vain hope! Sonny wriggled like an eel, and just as the expected
knock came evaded her silencing hand, so that the roof rang with
outraged yells:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302367">'Oh! 'oo's hurtin' me! Oo's hurtin' me!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302368">Without the words even, the sound was unmistakable; no native child
was ever so ear-piercing, so wildly indignant. Kate, beside herself,
tried soothings and force distractedly, in the midst of which an
imperative voice called fiercely--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302369">'Open the door quick, for God's sake! Anything's better than
that.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302370">For the moment, it was doubtless; for Sonny's yells ended with
victory; but another cry came sharp and short, as--the door giving
under Kate's hasty fingers--two men tumbled over the threshold. Jim
Douglas uppermost, his hands gripping the other's throat,</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302371">'Shut the door!' he gasped. 'Lock it. Then my revolver--no--a
knife--no noise--quick. I can't hold--the brute long.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302372">Kate turned and ran mechanically, and the steel in her hand gleamed
as she flew back. Jim Douglas, digging his knees into the ribs below
them, loosened one hand cautiously from the throat and held it out,
trembling, eager--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302373">But Kate saw his face. It might have been the Gorgon's, for she
stood as if turned to stone.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302374">'Don't be a fool!' he panted--'give it me! It's the only--' a
sudden twist beneath him sent his hand back to the throat. 'It's--it's
death anyway--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302375">Death! What did that matter? she asked herself. Let it come, rather
than murder!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302376">'No!' she said suddenly, 'you shall not. It is not worth it.' The
knife, flung backwards, fell with a clang; but the eyes which--though
that choking grip on the throat made all things dim--had been fixed on
its gleam, turned swiftly to those above them, and the writhing body
lay still as a corpse; none too soon, for Jim Douglas was almost
spent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302377">'A rope'--he muttered briefly, 'or stay, your veil will do.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302378">But Kate, trembling with the great passion and pity of her
decision, had scarce removed it ere Jim Douglas, changing his mind,
rose to his feet, leaving his antagonist free to do so likewise.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302380">'Get up, Tiddu,' he said breathlessly, 'and thank the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi><pb xml:id="fswater_1302379" n="320 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> for
saving your life. But the door's locked, and if you don't swear--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302381">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> need not threaten,' retorted
Tiddu far more calmly as he retwisted his rag of a turban. 'The
Many-faced know gratitude. They do not fall on those who find them
helpless and protect them.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302382">The thrust was keen, for in truth the old Baharupa had, not
half-an-hour before, by sheer chance found his pupil in difficulties,
and insisted on seeing him safe home and on his promising not to go
out again till he was stronger; to both of which coercions Jim
Douglas, in order to evade suspicion, had consented. Yet, but for
Kate, he would have knifed the old man remorselessly; even now he felt
doubtful of mercy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302383">Tiddu, however, saved him further anxiety by stepping close to Kate
and salaaming theatrically.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302384">'By Murri-âm and the <hi rend="italic">neem</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> is as my mother, the child as my child.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302385">So, for the first time, both he and Jim Douglas looked towards
Sonny, who, with wide-planted legs and wondering eyes, had been
watching Tiddu solemnly; the quaintest little figure with his red and
white cheeks and black muzzle.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302386">The old mime burst into a guffaw. 'Wâ! what a monkeyling!
Wâh! what a <hi rend="italic">tamâsha</hi> (spectacle),'
he cried, squatting down on his heels to look closer. In truth Sonny
was like a hill baboon, especially when he smiled too--broadly,
expectantly, at the familiar word.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302387">'<hi rend="italic">Tamathâ-wallah</hi>!' he said superbly,
'<hi rend="italic">bunao tamâtha, juldi bunao</hi>!' (make an
amusement; make it quick).</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302388">Tiddu, a child himself like all his race in his delight in
children, a child also in his capacity of sudden serenity, caught up
Kate's fallen veil, and in an instant dashed into the hackneyed part
of the daughter-in-law, while Kate and Jim Douglas stared; left
behind, as it were, by this strange irresponsible pair--the mimic of
life, and the child ignorant of what was mimicked. Tragedy a minute
ago! Now Farce! They looked at each other, startled, for sympathy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302389">'Make a funny man now,' came Sonny's confident voice, 'a funny man
behind a curtain--a funny man--wif a gween face an' a white face, an'
a lot of fwowers an' a bit o' tring.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302390">Tiddu looked round quickly at Jim Douglas. '<hi rend="italic">Wâh</hi>!' he said, 'the little <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> has a good memory. He remembers the Lord of
Life and Death.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302391" n="321 VOX HUMANA"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302392">But Kate had remembered it too, and she also had turned to Jim
Douglas passionately, almost accusingly. 'It was you! You were
Fate--you--,--Ah! I understand now!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302393">'Do you?' he answered with a frown. 'Then it's more than I do.' He
walked away moodily towards the knife Kate had flung away, and stooped
to pick it up. 'But you were right in what you did. It was an
inspiration. Look there!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302394">He pointed to the old Baharupa, who was playing antics to amuse
Sonny, who lisped, <hi rend="italic">'Thâ bâth</hi>!' (bravo!) solemnly at
each fresh effort. But Kate shivered. 'I did nothing. I thought I did;
but it was Fate.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302395">'My dear lady,' he retorted with a kindly smile, 'it is all in the
nature of dreams. The convalescent home is turned into a
crêche. But we must transfigure the street urchin into the
darling of his parent's hearts'--he paused, and looked at Kate
queerly--'I'll tell Tara to rig him out properly; and you must take
off half the stain, you know, and leave some colour on his cheeks; for
he must play the part as well as--' he laughed suddenly--'it is really
more dream-like than ever!' he added. And Kate thought so
too.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0406" n="6" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI<lb/>VOX HUMANA</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302396">THE five days following on the 2nd of August were a time of
festivity for the Camp, a time of funerals for the City. There was a
break in the rains, and on the Ridge the sunshine fell in floods upon
the fresh green grass, and the air, bright and cool, set men's minds
towards making the best of Nature's kindness; for she had been kind,
indeed, to the faithful little colony, and few even of the seniors
could remember a season so favourable in every way. And so the messes
talked of games, of races; and men, fresh from seeing their fellows
killed by balls on one side of the Ridge, joined those who on the
other side were crying 'Well bowled!' as wickets went down before
other balls.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302398">But in the city the unswept alleys fermented and festered in the
vapours and odours which rose from the great mass of humanity pent
within the rose-red walls. For the gates had<pb xml:id="fswater_1302397" n="322 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> been closed strictly save for those with permits to
come aid go. This was Bukht Khân's policy. Delhi was to stand
or fall as one man. There was to be no sneaking away while yet there
was time. So the hundreds of sepoys protesting illness, hunger, urgent
private affairs-every possible excuse for getting leave-were told that
if they would not fight they could sulk. Starve they might, stay they
should. The other Commanders-in-Chief, it is true, spent money in
bribing mercenaries for one week's more fighting; but Bukht
Khân only smiled sardonically. He had tried Bugles and Fifes,
he had tried the Drum-ecclesiastic; he was now trying his last
stop. The <hi rend="italic">Vox-Humana</hi> of self-preservation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302399">In the city itself, however, the preservation of life took for the
present another form, and never within the memory of man had there
been such a pounding of pestles and mortars over leaf-poultices. The
sound of it rose up at dawn and eve like the sound of the querns,
mingling with the <hi rend="italic">vox humana</hi> of grief as the
eastern and southern gates were set wide to let the dead pass out, and
allow the stores for the living to pass in.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302400">It formed a background to the gossip at the wells where the women
met to draw water.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302401">'Faiz-Ahmed found freedom at dawn,' said one between her yawns. 'He
was long in the throes. The <hi rend="italic">bibi's</hi> made a great
wailing, so I could not even sleep since then. There are no sons, see
you, and no money now the old man's annuity is gone.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302402">'<hi rend="italic">Loh</hi>, sister!' retorted another, 'thou
speakest as if death were a morsel of news to let dissolve on the
tongue. There be plenty such soppets in Delhi, and if I know aught of
wounds there will be another at nightfall. My mistress wastes time in
the pounding of simples, and I waste time in waiting for them till my
turn comes at the shop; for if it be not gangrened, I have no eyes.'
The speaker jerked her pot to her shoulder deftly and passed down the
alley.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302403">'Juntu is wise in such matters,' said a worn-looking woman with sad
eyes; 'I must get her to glance at my man's cut. 'Tis right to my
mind--he will put naught but water to it after some foreign
fashion--but who can tell these times?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302405">'Save that none pass their day, sister. Death will come of the
Great Sickness, or the wound, as it chooses,' put in a half-starved
soul who had to carry a baby besides her pot.<pb xml:id="fswater_1302404" n="323 VOX HUMANA"/> 'The cholera rages in our alley. 'Tis the smell. None sweep
the streets or flush the gutters now.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302406">'<hi rend="italic">Ari</hi>, Fukra!' cried a fierce virago, 'thou
art a traitor at heart! She bewails the pig-eating infidels who gave
her man five rupees a month to bring water to the drains. <hi rend="italic">Ai teri</hi>! If they saved one life from good cholera,
have they not reft a hundred in exchange from widows and orphans? <hi rend="italic">Oo-ai-ie-ee</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302407">Her howling wail, like a jackal's, was caught up whimperingly by
the others; and so they passed on with their water-pots, to spread
through the city the tale of Faiz Ahmed's freedom, Juntu's suspicions
of gangrene, and Karima the butcher's big wife's retort. And, in the
evening, folk gathered at the gates, and talked over it all again as
the funerals passed out; old Faiz-Ahmed in his new gold shoes looking
better as a corpse, tied up in tinsel, than as a martyr, so the
spectators agreed. Whereat his family had their glow of pride
also.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302408">Then, when the show was over, the crowd dispersed to pay visits of
condolence, and raise that wailing <hi rend="italic">vox humana</hi>
in every alley.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302409">Greatly to Jim Douglas's relief, for there was another voice
difficult to keep quiet when the cool evenings came, and all Kate's
replies in Hindustani would not beguile Sonny's tongue from
English. He was the quaintest mother's darling now, in a little tinsel
cap fringed with brown silk tassels hiding that dreadful gangway,
anklets and bracelets on his bare corn-coloured limbs, the ruddy
colour showing through the dye on his cheeks, his palms all
henna-stained, his eyes blackened with <hi rend="italic">kohl</hi>,
and a variety of little tinsel and brocaded coatees ending far above
his dimpled knees. There were little muslin and net ones too cunningly
streaked with silver and gold, for Tara was reckless over the boy. She
insisted, too, on a great black smudge on his forehead to keep away
the evil eye; and Soma, coming now with the greatest regularity,
brought odd little coral and grass neck lets such as Rajpoot bairns
ought to wear; while Tiddu, the child's great favourite, had a new toy
every day for the little <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. Paper
whirligigs, cotton-wool bears on a stick, mud parrots and such like,
whereat Sonny would lisp, '<hi rend="italic">Thâ-bâth</hi>, Tiddu.' Though sometimes he
would go over to Kate and ask appealingly, 'Miffis Erlton! What has
a-come of my polly?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302410" n="324 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302411">Then she, startled into realities by the words, would catch him up
in her arms, and look round as if for protection to Jim Douglas, who
having overdone himself in the struggle with Tiddu, had felt it wiser
to defer further action for a day or two; the more so because Tiddu
had promised to help him to the uttermost if he would only be
reasonable, and leave times and seasons to one who had ten times the
choice that he had.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302412">So he would smile back at Kate and say, 'It's all right,
Mrs. Erlton. At least as right as it can be. The lot of them are
devoted to the child.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302413">Yet in his heart he knew there was danger in so many
confederates. He felt that this incredibly peaceful home on the
housetops could not last. Here he was looking at a woman who was not
his wife, a child who was not his child, and feeling vaguely that they
were as much a part of his life as if they were; as if, had they been
so, he would have been quite contented--more contented than he had
been on that other roof. He was, even now, more contented than he had
been there. As he sat, his head on his hand, watching the pretty
picture which akte in Zora's jewels made with the be-tinselled,
be-scented, be-decked child, he thought of his relief when years
before he had looked at a still little morsel lying in Zora's
veil. Had it been brutal of him? Would that dead baby have grown into
a Sonny? Or was it because Sonny's skin was really white beneath the
stain that he thought of him as something to be proud of possessing;
of a boy who would go to school and be fagged and flogged and inherit
familiar virtues and vices instead of strange ones?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302414">'What are you thinking of, Mr. Greyman? Do you want any thing?'
came Kate's kind voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302415">'Nothing,' he replied, in the half-bantering tone he so often used
towards her; 'I have more than my fair share of things already,
surely! I was only meditating on the word '<hi rend="italic">Om</hi>'--the final mystery of all things.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302417">So, in a way, he was. On the mystery of fatherhood and motherhood,
which had had nothing to do with that pure idyll of romantic passion
on the terraced roof at Lucknow, yet which seemed to touch him here,
where there was not even love. Yet it was a better thing. The passion
of protection, of absolute self-forgetfulness, seeking no reward,
which<pb xml:id="fswater_1302416" n="325 VOX HUMANA"/> the sight of those two raised in him
was a better thing than that absorption in another self. The thought
made him cross over to where Kate sat with the child in her lap, and
say gravely--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302418">'The <hi rend="italic">crêche</hi> is more interesting than
the convalescent home; at least to me, Mrs. Erlton! I shall be quite
sorry when it ends.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302419">'When it ends ?' she echoed quickly. 'There is nothing wrong, is
there? Sonny has been so good, and that time when he was naughty the
sweeper-woman seemed quite satisfied when Tara said he was speaking
Pushtoo.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302420">'But it cannot last for all that,' he replied. 'It is dangerous. I
feel it is. This is the 5th, and I am nearly all right. I must get
Tiddu to arrange for Sonny first--then for you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302421">'And you?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302422">'I'll follow. It will be safer, and there is no fear for me. I
can't understand why I've had no answer from your husband. The letter
went two days ago, and I am convinced we ought to have heard.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302423">The frown was back on his face, the restlessness in his brain; and
both grew when in private talk with Tiddu the latter hinted at
suspicions in the caravan which had made it necessary for hint to be
very cautious. The letter, therefore, had certainly been delayed,
might never have reached. If no answer came by the morrow, he himself
would take the opportunity of a portion of the caravan having a permit
to pass out, and so ensure the news reaching the Ridge; trusting to
get into the city again without delay, though the gates were very
strictly kept. Nevertheless, in his opinion, the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> would be wiser with patience. There was no
immediate danger in continuing as they were, and the end could not be
long if it was true that the great <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn</hi>
was with the Punjâb reinforcements; since all the world knew
that <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn</hi> was the prince of <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi>, having the gift, not only of being all
things to all people, but of making all people be all things to him,
which was more than the Baharupas could do.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302424">In truth, the news that John Nicholson was coming to Delhi made
even Jim Douglas hesitate at risking anything unnecessarily, so long
as things went smoothly. As for the letter to Major Erlton, it was no
doubt true that the number of spies sending information to the Ridge
had made it difficult of late to send any, since the guards were on
the alert.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302425" n="326 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302426">It was so, indeed, even for the Queen herself, who had a missive
she was peculiarly anxious should not fall into strange hands.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302428">'There is no fear, Ornament-of-Palaces,' said Ahsan-Oolah urbanely;
'I will stake my life on its reaching.' He did not add that his chief
reason for saying so was that a similar letter, written by the King,
had been safely delivered by Rujjub Ali the spy, whose house lay
conveniently near the physician's own, and from whom both the latter
and Elâhi-Buksh heard authentic news from the Ridge; news which
made them both pity the poor old pantaloon who, as they knew well, had
been a mere puppet in stronger hands. And these two, laying their
heads together in one of those kaleidoscope combinations of intrigue
which made Delhi politics a puzzle even at the time, advised the King
to use the <hi rend="italic">voix celeste</hi> as an antidote to the
<hi rend="italic">vox humana</hi> of the city which was being so
diligently fostered by the Queen and Bukht-Khân. Let him say he
was too old for this world, let him profess himself unable longer to
cope with his coercers, and claim to be allowed to resign and become a
fakeer! But the dream still lingered in the old man's brain. He loved
the brocaded bags, he loved the new cushion to the Peacock Throne; and
though the cockatoo's crest was once more showing a yellow tinge
through the green, the thought of <hi rend="italic">Jehâd</hi>
lingered sanctimoniously. But other folk in the palace were beginning
to awake. Other people in Delhi besides Tiddu had heard that <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn</hi> was on his way from the Punjâb,
and not even the rose-red walls had been able to keep out his
reputation. Folk talked of him in whispers. The soldiers, unable to
retreat, unwilling to fight, swore loudly that they were betrayed;
that there were too many spies in the city. Of that there could be no
doubt. Were not letters found concealed in innocent-looking cakes and
such like? Had not one, vaguely suggesting that some cursed infidels
were still concealed in the city, been brought in for reward by a
Bunjâra who swore he had picked it up by chance? The tales grew
by the telling in the Thunbi Bazaar, making Prince Abool-Bukr, who had
returned to it incontinently after the disastrous failure of faith on
the 2nd, hiccup magnificently that, poor as he was, he would give ten
golden <hi rend="italic">molhurs</hi> to any one who set him on the
track of a hell-doomed. Yea! folk might laugh, but he was good for ten
still. Ay! and a<pb xml:id="fswater_1302427" n="327 VOX HUMANA"/> rupee besides, to have
the offer cried through the bazaar; so there would be an end to
scoffers!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302429">'What is 't ?' asked the languid loungers in the wooden balconies,
as the drum came beating down the street.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302430">Only Abool offering ten <hi rend="italic">mohurs</hi> for a
Christian to kill,' said one.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302431">'And he swore he had not a rupee when I danced for him but
yesterday,' said another.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302432">'He has to pay Newâsi, sister,' yawned a third.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302433">'Then let her dance for him--I do it no longer,' retorted the
grumbler.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302434">So the crier and his drums passed down the scoffing bazaar. 'He
will find many at that price,' quoth some, winking at their
neighbours; for the Prince was a butt when in his cups.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302435">Thus at earliest dawn next morning, the 7th of August, Tiddu gave a
signal knock at the door of the roof, rousing Jim Douglas, who since
the child's arrival had taken to sleeping across it once more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302436">'There is danger in the air, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>,' he
said briefly; 'they cried a reward for infidels in the bazaar
yesterday. There is talk of some letter--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302437">'The child must go--go at once,' replied his hearer, alert in an
instant; but Tiddu shook his head.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302438">'Not till dark, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. The bullocks are to
pass out with the moon, and he must pass out with them. In a sack, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. Say nothing till the last. Then,--the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> knows the cloth merchant's by the Delhi
gate?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302439">Jim Douglas nodded.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302440">'There is a court at the back. The bullocks are there, for we are
taking cloth the Lâla wants to smuggle out; a length or two in
each empty sack; for he hath been looted beyond limits. So he will
have no eyes, nor the caravan either, for secret work in dark
corners. Bring the boy drugged as he came here--the Rajpootni will
carry the bundle as a spinner--to the third door down the lane. 'Tis
an empty yard; I will have the bullock there with the half-load of raw
cotton. We leave two or three more as foils to the empty bags. Come as
a Bunjâra, then the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> can see the
last of the child, and see old Tiddu's loyalty.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302442">The familiar whine came back to his voice ; he could scarcely
resist a thrust forward of his open hand. But dignity or no<pb xml:id="fswater_1302441" n="328 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> dignity, Jim Douglas knew that
itching palm well, and said significantly--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302443">'It will be worth a thousand rupees to you, Tiddu, if the child
gets safe.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302444">A look of offended virtue came over the smooth face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302445">'This slave is not thinking of money. The child is as his own
child.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302446">'And the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> as your mother, remember,' put
in the other quickly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302447">Tiddu hesitated, 'If his servant saves the <hi rend="italic">baba</hi>, cannot the master save the lady?' he said,
with the effrontery of a child trying how far he might go; but Jim
Douglas's revolver was out in a second, and Tiddu with air air of
injured innocence went on without a pause--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302448">'The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will be safe enough, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, when the child is gone; if the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> will himself remain day and night to answer
for the screened sick woman within. His slave will be back by dawn;
and if he smells trouble, the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> must be moved
in a dhoolie to another house, the Rajpootni must go home, and I will
be mother-in-law. I can play the part, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302449">He could indeed! thought Jim Douglas. If Kate were to be safe
anywhere, it would be with this old scoundrel with his thousand-faces,
his undoubted gift for influencing the eyes of men. Three days of
passing from one place to another, with him in some new character, and
their traces must be lost. A good plan certainly!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302450">'And there is no danger to-day?' he asked finally. Tiddu paused
again, and his luminous eyes sought the <hi rend="italic">sahib's</hi>. 'Who can say that, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, for a <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>, in this
city. But I think none. We can do no more, danger or not. And I will
watch. And see, here is the dream-giver. The Rajpootni will know the
dose for the child.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302451">The dream-giver! All that day the little screw of paper Tiddu had
taken from his waistbelt lay in a fold of Jim Douglas's high-twined
<hi rend="italic">pugri</hi>, and its contents seemed to make him
dull. Not that it nattered, since there was literally nothing to be
done before dusk; for it would be cruel to tell Kate and keep her on
tenter-hooks all day to no purpose. But after a while she noticed his
dulness, and came over to where he sat, his head on his hand, in his
favourite attitude.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302453">'I believe you are going to have fever and ague again,' she<pb xml:id="fswater_1302452" n="329 VOX HUMANA"/> said solicitously, 'do take some aconite; if
we could only get some quinine, that would end the tiresome thing at
once.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302454">He took some to please her, and because her suggestion gave him a
reasonable excuse for being slack; but as he lounged about lazily,
watching her playing with the boy, seeing her put him to sleep as the
heat of the day came on, noting the cheerful content with which she
adapted herself to a simplicity of life unknown to her three months
before, the wonder of the circumstances which had led to it faded in
the regret that it should be coming to an end. It had been three
months of incredible peace and goodwill; and to-day the peace and the
goodwill seemed to strike him all the more keenly because he knew that
in an hour or so at most he must disturb it. It seemed hard.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302455">But something else began the task for him. About sunset a sudden
flash dazzled his eyes, and ere he grasped its vividness the walls
were rocking silently, and a second after a roar as of a thousand
thunder-claps deafened his ears. Kate had Sonny in her arms ere he
could reach her, thrusting her away from the high parapet wall, which,
in one already-cracked corner, looked as if it must come down; which
did indeed crumble outwards, leaving a jagged gap half-way down its
height, the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> falling with a rattle on the roof of the next
house.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302456">But ere the noise ended the vibration had passed, leaving him with
relief on his face looking at a great mushroom of smoke and steam
which had shot up into the sky.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302457">'It is the powder-factory!' he exclaimed, using Hindustani for
Tara's benefit as well, since she had rushed in from the outer court
at the first hint of danger to cling round his feet. 'It is all over
now, but it's lucky we were no nearer.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302459">As he spoke he was wondering if this would make any difference in
Tiddu's plans for the night, since the powder factory had stood
equa-distant between them and the Delhi Gate. He wondered also what
had caused the explosion. Not a shell certainly. The factory had
purposely been placed at the furthest point from the Ridge. However,
there was a fine supply of powder gone, and, he hoped, a few
mutineers. But Kate's mind had reverted to that other explosion which
had been the prologue to the three months of peace and<pb xml:id="fswater_1302458" n="330 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> quiet. Was this one to be the epilogue? A
vague dread, a sudden premonition made her ask quickly--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302460">'Can it mean anything serious? Can anything be the matter,
Mr. Greyman? Is anything wrong?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302461">It was a trifle early, he thought--she might have had another half
hour or so of peace. But this was a good beginning, or rather a
fitting end.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302462">'And you have known this all day?' she said reproachfully when he
told her the truth. 'How unkind of you not to tell me!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302463">'Unkind!' he echoed. 'What possible good--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302464">'I should have known it was the last day--I--I should have made
the--the most of it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302465">He felt glad of his own impatience of the sentimentality as he
turned away, for in truth the look on her face hit him hard. It sent
him to pace up and down the outer roof restlessly till the time for
action came. Then he had a whispered consultation with Tara regarding
the dose of raw opium safe for a child of Sonny's years.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302466">'Are you sure that is not too much?' he asked anxiously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302467">Tara looked at the little black pellet she was rolling gravely. 'It
is large, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, but it is for life or death;
and if it was the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> own son I would give
no less.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302468">Once more the remembrance of the still little morsel in Zora's
tinsel veil brought an odd compunction--for the very possibility of
this strange child's death roused greater pain than that certainty had
done. He felt unnerved at the responsibility; but Kate, looking up as
he rejoined her, held out her hand without a tremor.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302469">'Give it me, please,' she said, and her voice was steady also; 'he
will take it best from me. I have some sugar here.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302470">The child, drowsy already with the near approach of bedtime, was in
her lap, and rested his head on her breast, is with her arms still
round him--her hands disguised the drug.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302471">'It is a very large dose,' she said dully. 'I knew it must be;
that's why I wanted to give it--myself. Sonny! Open your mouth,
darling--it's quite sweet--there--swallow it quick--that's a good
sonnikins.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302473">'You are very brave,' he said with a catch in his voice. She
glanced up at him for a second with a sort of scorn in<pb xml:id="fswater_1302472" n="331 VOX HUMANA"/> her eyes. 'I knew he would take it from me,' she
replied, and then, shifting the child to an easier position, began to
sing in a half-voice--
<q><l>'There is a happy land--'</l></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302474">'Far--farze--away,' echoed Sonny contentedly. It was his usual
lullaby, chosen because it resembled a native air, beloved of
ayahs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302475">And as she sang and Sonny's eyelids drooped, the man watched them
both with a tender awe in his heart; and the other woman, crouching in
the corner, watched all three with hungry, passionate eyes. Here, in
this group of man, woman, and child, without a personal claim on each
other, was something new, half-incomprehensible, wholly-sweet.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302476">'He is asleep now,' said Kate after a time. 'You had better take
him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302477">He stooped to obey, and she stooped also to leave a long, lingering
kiss on the boy's soft cheek. It sent a thrill through the man as he
recognised that in giving him the child she had given him more than
kisses.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302478">The feeling that it was so made him linger a few minutes afterwards
at the door with a new sense of his responsibilities towards her to
say--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302479">'I wish I had not to leave you alone.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302480">'You will be back directly, and I shall be all right,' she said,
pausing in her closing of the door, for Tara had already passed down
the stair with her bundle.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302481">'Shall I lock it outside?' he began. Tara and he had been used to
do so in those first days when they left her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302482">She laid her hand lightly on his arm. 'Don't, she said, 'don't get
anxious about me again. What can happen in halfan-hour?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302484">He heard her slip the catch on the staple, however, before he ran
downstairs. He was to take a different road to the Delhi Gate from the
quiet, more devious alleys which Tara would choose in her character of
poor spinner carrying her raw stuff home. She was to await his
arrival, to deposit the bundle somewhere close to the third door in
the back lane by the cloth merchant's shop, leaving it to him to take
inside, as if he were one of the caravan; this plan insuring two
things--immunity from notice in the streets, and also in the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302483" n="332 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> yard. But, as Tara would be
longer than he by a few minutes in reaching the tryst, he purposely
went through a bit of the Thunbi bazaar to hear what he could of the
explosion. He was surprised--a trifle alarmed--at the
excitement. Crowds were gathered round many of the balconies, talking
of spies, swearing that half the court was in league with the Ridge,
and that, after all, Abool-Bukr might not have a wild-goose chase.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302485">'There will be naught but slops and slaps for him in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> information, I'll swear,' said one, with a
laugh. 'I'll back old Mother Sobrai to beat off a dozen princes.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302486">'And blows and bludgeons in <hi rend="italic">mine</hi>,' chuckled
another. 'I chose the house of Bahâdur, the single-stick
player.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302487">And as, having no more time to lose, he cut across gatewards, he
saw down an alley a mob surging round Ahsan-
Oolah the physician's house, and heard a passer-by say they had the
traitor safe. It made him vaguely uneasy, since he knew that--when
once the talk turns on hidden things--people, not to be behindhand in
gossip, rake up every trivial doubt and wonder.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302488">Still there was the file of bullocks waiting by the cloth
merchant's as arranged. And as he passed into the lane a dim figure,
scarce seen in the dark, slipped out of the further end. And there was
the bundle. He caught it up as if it belonged to him, and after
knocking gently at the third door pushed it open, knowing that he must
show no hesitation. He found himself in a sort of outhouse or covered
entrance, pitch dark save for a faintly lighter square showing an
outlet, doubtless, into the yard beyond. He moved towards it, and
stumbled over something unmistakable upon the floor. A man! He dropped
the bundle promptly to be ready in case the sleeper should be a
stranger. But there was no movement, and he knelt down to feel if it
was Tiddu. A Bunjâra!--that also was unmistakable at the first
touch--but the limpness was unmistakable too. The man was dead--still
warm, but dead! By all that was unlucky!--not Tiddu surely! With the
flint-and-steel in his waist cloth, he lit a tuft of cotton from the
bundle as a torch.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302489">It was Jhungi!--Jhungi with a knife in his heart!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302490">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>!' came the familiar creak, as Tiddu,
attracted by the sudden light, stole in from the yard beyond. 'Quick!
there is no time to loose. Give me the bundle and go back.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302491" n="333 VOX HUMANA"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302492">'Go back!' echoed. Jim Douglas amazed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302493">'<hi rend="italic">Huzoor!</hi> take off the Bunjâra's
dress. I have a green turban and shawl here. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> must go back to the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> at once. There is treachery.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302494">Jim Douglas swore under his breath as he obeyed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302495">'I know not what, but the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> must not stay
there. I heard him boasting before, and just now I caught him
prying.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302496">'Who, Jhungi?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302497">Even at such a moment Tiddu demurred.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302498">'The <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> mistakes. It is the miscreant
Bhungi--Jhungi is virtuous--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302499">'You killed him then?' interrupted the hearer, putting the last
touch to his disguise.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302500">'What else could I do, <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>? I had only my
knife. And it is not as if it were--Jhungi--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302501">But Jim Douglas was already out of the door, running through the
dark deserted lanes while he dared, since he must walk through the
bazaar. And as he ran he told himself that he was a fool to be so
anxious. What could go wrong in half-an-hour?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302502">What indeed!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302504">As he stood five minutes after, staring into the dark emptiness of
the roof, he asked himself again and again what could have happened?
There had been no answer to his knock; the door had been hasped on the
outside, yet the first glance as he entered. made him realise that the
place was empty of life. And though he had lit the cresset, with a
fierce fear at what it might reveal, he could find no trace, even of a
struggle. Kate had disappeared! Had she gone out? Impossible. Had Tara
heard of the danger, returned and taken her elsewhere? Possible, but
improbable. He passed rapidly down the stairs again. The storey below
the roof, being reserved for the owner's use on his occasional visits
to Delhi, was empty; the occupants of the second floor, pious folk,
had fled from the city a day or two before; and when he paused to
inquire on the ground floor to know if there had been any disturbance
he found the door padlocked outside--sure sign that every one was
out. Oh! why, he thought, had he not so padlocked that other door
upstairs? He passed out into the street, beginning to realise that his
task was over just as he had ceased to gird at it. There was nothing
unusual to be seen. The godly folk about were<pb xml:id="fswater_1302503" n="334 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> beginning to close their gates for the night;
and some paused to listen with an outraged air to the thrummings and
drummings from the Princess Farkhoonda's roof. And that was
Abool-Bukr's voice singing--
<q><l>'O mistress rare, divine!'</l></q>
Then it could scarcely be he who had found Kate; besides, she might
have met with friends in that quarter, where so many learned folk
deemed the slaughter of women unlawful. But, he told himself, there
was no use in speculating; he must find Tara first. He paused,
however, to inquire from the cobbler at the corner; disturbance echoed
the man; not much more than usual; the Prince, who had passed in
half-an-hour agone, being perhaps a bit wilder after his wild-goose
chase. Had not the Aga-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> heard? The wags of
the bazaar had taken up the offer made by the Prince; and his servants
had sworn they were glad to get him to the Princess's, since they had
been whacked out of half-a-dozen houses! He was safe now, however, for
when he was of that humour Newâsi Begum never let him go till
he was too drunk for mischief.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302505">Then, thought Jim Douglas, it was possible that Jhungi might have
given real information; still but one thing was certain--the roof was
empty; the dream had vanished into thin air.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302506">He did not know as he passed through the dim streets that their
dream was over also, and that John Nicholson stood looking down from
the Ridge on the shadowy mass of the town. He had posted in a hundred
and twenty miles that day, arriving in time to hear the explosion of
the magazine. The city's salute of welcome, as it were, to the man who
was to take it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302507">He had been dining at the head-quarters mess, taciturn and grave--a
wet blanket on the jollity, and the Moselle cup, and the fresh cut of
cheese from the new Europe-shop; and now, when others were calling
cheery good-nights as they passed to their tents, he was off to wander
alone round the walls, measuring them with his keen kindly eyes. A
giant of a man, biting his lips beneath his heavy brown beard, making
his way over the rocks, sheltering in shadow, doggedly, moodily, lost
in thought. He was parcelling out his world for conquest, settling
already where to prick the bubble.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302508" n="335 VOX HUMANA"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302509">But, in a way, it was pricked already. For as he prowled about the
palace walls, a miserable old man, minus even the solace of
pulse-feeling and cooling draughts, was dictating a letter to
Hâfzan the woman scribe. A miserable letter, to be duly sent
next day to the Commanders-in-Chief, and forwarded by them to the
volunteers of Delhi. A disjointed rambling effusion worthy of the
shrunken mind and body which held but a rambling disjointed memory
even of the advice given it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302510">'Have I not done all in my power to please the soldiery,' it
ran. 'But it is to be deplored that you have, notwithstanding, shown
no concern for my life, no consideration for my old age. The care of
my health was in the hands of Ahsan-Oolah, who kept himself constantly
informed of the changes it underwent. Now there is none to care for me
but God, while the changes in my health are such as may not be
imagined; therefore the soldiers and officers ought to gratify me and
release the physician, so that he may come whenever he thinks it
necessary to examine my pulse. Furthermore, the property plundered
from his house belonged to the king, therefore it should be traced and
collected and conveyed to our presence. If you are not disposed to
comply, let me be conveyed to the Kutb shrine and employ myself as a
sweeper of the Mosque. And if even this be not acceded I will still
relinquish every concern and jump up from my seat. Not having been
killed by the English I will be killed by you; for I shall swallow a
diamond and go to sleep. Moreover, in the plunder of the Physician's
house a small box containing our seal was carried away. No paper,
therefore, of a date subsequent to the 7th August 1857 bearing our
seal will be valid.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302511">A miserable letter indeed. The Dream of Sovereignty had come to an
end with that salute of welcome to John Nicholson.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1302512" n="[336]"/><div xml:id="fswater_0500" n="5" type="book"><head>BOOK V <lb/><hi rend="italic">'THERE AROSE A MAN'</hi></head><div xml:id="fswater_0501" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I<lb/>FORWARD</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302513">'ARE you here on duty, sir?' asked a brief imperious voice. Major
Erlton, startled from a half-dream as he sate listlessly watching the
target practice from the Crow's Nest, rose and saluted. His height
almost matched the speaker's, but he looked small in comparison with
the indescribable air of dominant power and almost arrogant strength
in the other figure. It seemed to impress him, for he pulled himself
together smartly with a certain confidence, and looked, in truth,
every inch a soldier.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302514">'No, sir,' he replied as briefly, 'on pleasure.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302515">A distinct twinkle showed for a second in General Nicholson's
deep-set hazel eyes. 'Then go to your bed, sir, and sleep. You look as
if you wanted some.' He spoke almost rudely; but as he turned on his
heel he added in a louder voice than was necessary had he meant the
remark for his companion's ear only, 'I shall want good fighting men
before long, I expect.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302517">If he did, he might reckon on one. Herbert Erlton was not good at
formulating his feelings into definite thoughts, but as he went back
to the peaceful side of the Ridge he told himself vaguely that he was
glad Nicholson had come. He was the sort of man a fellow would be glad
to follow, especially when he was dead-sick and weary of waiting and
doing nothing--save get killed! Yes! he was a real good sort, and, as
even the chaplain had said at mess, they hadn't felt quite so besieged
on the Ridge these last two days since<pb xml:id="fswater_1302516" n="337 FORWARD"/> he
came. And, by George! he had hit the right nail on the head. A man
wasn't much good without sleep.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302518">So, with a certain pride in following the advice, Major Erlton
flung himself on his cot and promptly dozed off. In truth he needed
rest. Sonny Seymour's safe arrival in camp two nights before, in
charge of a Bunjâra, from whom even Hodson had been unable to
extract anything--save that the Agha-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> had
forgotten a letter in his hurry, and that the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was safe, or had been safe--had sent Major
Erlton to watch those devilish walls more feverishly than ever. Not
that it really mattered whether Kate was alive or dead, he told
himself. No! he did not mean that, quite. He would be awfully
glad--God! how glad! to know her safe. But it wouldn't alter other
things, would not even alter them in regard to her. So, once more, he
waited for the further news promised him, with a strange indifference,
save to the thought that, alive or dead, Kate was within the
walls--like another woman--like many women.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302519">And now he was dreaming that he was inside them also, sword in
hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302520">There seemed some chance of it indeed, men were saying to each
other, as they looked after John Nicholson's tall figure as it
wandered into every post and picquet, asking brief questions, pleased
with brief replies. Every now and again pausing, as it were, to come
out of his absorption and take a sudden, keen interest in something
beyond the great question. As when, passing the tents of the only lady
in camp, he saw Sonny, who had been made over to her till he could be
sent back to his mother who had escaped to Meerut; during which brief
time he was the plaything of a parcel of subalterns who delighted in
him, tinsel cap, anklets, and all. Major Erlton had at first rather
monopolised the child, trying to find out something definite from him;
but as he insisted that 'Miffis Erlton lived up in the 'ky wif a man
wif a gween face, and a white face, and a lot of fwowers, and a bit of
tring,' and spoke familiarly of Tiddu, and Tara, and Soma, without
being able to say who they were, the major had given it up as a bad
job and gone back to the walls. So the subalterns had the child to
themselves, and were playing pranks with him as the general passed
by.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302522">'Fine little fellow!' he said suddenly. 'I like to see children's
legs and arms. Up in Bunnoo the babies were just<pb xml:id="fswater_1302521" n="338 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> like that young monkey. Real corn-colour. I got
quite smitten with them and sent for a lot of toys from Lahore. Only I
had to bar Lawrence from peg-tops, for I knew I should have got
peg-topping with the boys, and that would have been fatal to my
dignity. That is the worst of high estates. You daren't make friends,
and you have to make enemies.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302523">The smile which had made him look years younger faded, and he was
back in the great problem of his life--how to keep pace with his
yoke-fellows, how to scorn consequences and steer straight to
independent action, without spoiling himself by setting his seniors
and superiors in arms against him. He had never solved it yet. His
career had been one long race with the curb on. A year before he had
thrown up the game in disgust, and begged to be transferred from the
Punjâb while he could go with honour; and even his triumphant
march Delhi-wards--in which he found disaffection, disobedience, and
doubt, and left fear, trembling, and peace--had been marred by much
rebuking. So that once, nothing but the inner sense that pin-points
ought not to let out the heart's blood, kept him at his post; and but
two days before, on the very eve of that hundred-and-twenty mile rush
to Delhi, he had written claiming definitely the right of an officer
in his position to quarrel anybody's opinion, and asserting his duty
of speaking out, no matter at what risk of giving offence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302525">And now, a man years younger than those in nominal command--he was
but six-and-thirty,--and holding views diametrically opposed to
theirs, he had been sent here, virtually, to take Delhi because those
others could not. No wonder, then, that the question how to avoid
collision puzzled him. Not because he knew that his appointment was in
itself an offence, that some people affected to speak of him still as
Mr. Nicholson--that being his real rank--but because he knew in his
heart of hearts that at any moment he might do something
appalling. Move troops under some one else's command, without a
reference, as he had done before during his career! Then, naturally,
there must be 'ructions. He had a smile for the thought
himself. Still, for the present, concord was assured; since, until his
column arrived, the repose of the lion couching for a spring was
manifestly the only policy; though it might be necessary to wag the
tail a<pb xml:id="fswater_1302524" n="339 FORWARD"/> bit--to do more than merely forbid
sorties and buglings. The fools, for instance, who harassed the
Metcalfe House picquet, might be shown their mistake and made to
understand that, if the Ridge called 'time!' for a little decent rest
before the final round, it meant to have it. So he passed on his
errand to inculcate Headquarters with his decision, leaving Sonny
playing with the boys.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302526">Meanwhile one of the garrison, at least, had found the benefit of
his keen judgment. Herbert Erlton had passed from dreams of conflict
to the real rest of unconscious sleep, oblivious of everything; even
those rose-red walls.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302527">But within them another man, haggard and anxious as he had been,
was still allowing himself no rest in his search for Kate
Erlton. Tara, as much at a loss as he, was helping him; for though at
first she had been relieved at the idea of the <hi rend="italic">mem's</hi> disappearance, she had soon realised that the
master ran more risk than ever in his reckless determination to find
some trace of the missing woman. And Tiddu, who had returned, helped
also. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>, he said, must have found
friends; must be alive. Such a piece of gossip as the discovery and
death of an Englishwoman could not have been kept from the Thunbi
bazaar. Then those who had passed from the roof had been calm enough
to hasp the door behind them; that did not look like violence. If the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> would only be patient and wait,
something would turn up. There were other kindly folk in the city
besides himself! But, in the meantime, he would do well to allow Soma
to slip into the sulky indifference he seemed to prefer, and take no
notice of him. It only meant that he, and half the good soldiers in
Delhi, were mad with themselves for having chosen the losing side; for
with <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn</hi> on the Ridge, what chance had
Delhi?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302529">This was rather an exaggerated picture; still it was a fairly
faithful presentiment of the inward thoughts of many, who, long before
this, had begun to ask themselves what the devil they were doing in
that galley? Yet there they were, and there they must fight. Soma,
however, was doubtful even of that. His heart positively ached as he
listened to the tales told in the very heart of Delhi of the man whom
other men worshipped--the man who took forts singlehanded, and said
that, given the powers of a provost-marshal, he would control a
disobedient army in two days! The man<pb xml:id="fswater_1302528" n="340 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> who yoked bribe-taking <hi rend="italic">tahseeldars</hi>
into the village well-wheel to draw water for the robbed <hi rend="italic">ryots</hi>, and set women of loose virtue, who came into
his camp, to cool in muddy tanks. The man who flung every law-book on
his office table at his clerks' heads, and then--with a kindly
apologetic smile--paused while they replaced theirs for future
use. The man who gave toys to children, and remorselessly hung two
abettors of a vile murder, when he could not lay hands on the
principal. The man, finally, who flogged those who worshipped him into
promising adoration for the future to a very ordinary mortal of his
acquaintance! Briefly the hero, the demi-god, who perhaps was neither,
but, as Tiddu declared, had simply the greatest gift of all--the gift
of making men what he wished them to be. Either way it was gall and
wormwood to Soma--hero-worshipper by birth--that his side should have
no such colossal figure to follow. So, sulky and sore, he held aloof
from both sides, doing his bounden duty to both, and no more. Keeping
guards when his fellows took bribes to fight, and agreeing with Tiddu,
that since some others besides themselves knew of the roof, it was
safer for the master to lock it up, and live for a time elsewhere.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302531">So, all unwwwittingly, the only chance of finding Kate was
lost. For what had happened was briefly this. Five minutes after Jim
Douglas had left her, Prince Abool-Bukr, who had kept this <hi rend="italic">renseignement</hi>--given him by a Bunjâra, who
had promised to be in waiting and was not--to the last because it was
close to the haven where he would be, had come roystering up the
stairs, followed by his unwilling retainers suggesting that the Most
Illustrious had really better desist from violating seclusion since
they were all black and blue already. But, from sheer devilry and
desire to outrage the quarter, which by its complaints had already
brought him into trouble, the prince had begun battering at the
door. Kate running to bar it more securely, saw that the hasp,
carelessly hitched over the staple, was slipping--had slipped; and had
barely time to dash into the inner roof ere the prince, unexpectant of
the sudden giving way, tumbled headlong into the outer one. The fall
gave her an instant more, but made him angry; and the end would have
been certain, if Kate, seeing the new-made gap in the wall before her,
had not availed herself of it. There was a roof not far<pb xml:id="fswater_1302530" n="341 FORWARD"/> below she knew--the <hi rend="italic">débris</hi>
would be on a slope perhaps--the blue-eyed boy had escaped by the
roofs. All this flashed through her, as by the aid of a stool, which
she kicked over in her scramble, she gained the top of the gap and
peered over. The next instant she had dropped herself down some four
feet; finding a precarious foothold on a sliding slope of rubble, and
still clinging to the wall with her hands. If no one looked over, she
thought breathlessly, she was safe! And no one did. The general air of
decent privacy alarmed the retainers into remembering that two of
their number had found death their reward for their master's last
escapade in that quarter; so, after one glance round, they swore the
place was empty, and dragged him off, feebly protesting that it was
his last chance, and he had not bagged a single Christian.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302532">Kate heard the door closed, heard the voices retreat down stairs,
and then set herself to get back over the gap. It did not seem a
difficult task. The slope on which she hung gave fair foothold, and by
getting a good grip on the brick-work, and perhaps displacing a brick
or two in the crack lower down, as a step, she ought to get up
easily. It was lucky the crack was there, she thought. In one way, not
in another, for, as in her effort she necessarily threw all her weight
on the wall, another bit of it gave way, she fell backwards, and so,
half covered with bricks and mud, rolled to the roof below, which was
luckily not more than eight or nine feet down. It was far enough,
however, for the fall to have killed her; but, though she lay quite
unconscious, she was not dead, only stunned, shaken, confused, unable
absolutely to think. It was almost dawn, indeed, before she realised
that her only chance of getting up again was in calling for help; and
by that time the door above had been locked, and there was no one to
hear her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302534">The few square yards of roof on to which she had rolled belonged to
one of those box-like buildings, half-turrets, half-summer houses,
which natives build here, there, and everywhere at all sorts of
elevations, until the view of a town from a topmost roof resembles
nothing so much as the piles of luggage awaiting the tidal train at
Victoria. This particular square belonged to a tiny turret, which
stood on a long narrow roof, belonging in its turn to an arcaded slip
of summer-house standing on a sq hare, and set round by high parapet
walls. Quite a staircase of roofs! The one where she was<pb xml:id="fswater_1302533" n="342 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> had had a thatch set against
the wall, but it had fallen in with the weight of bricks and mortar;
still she might be able to creep between it and the wall for
shelter. And on the slip of roof below, Indian corn was drying, during
this break in the rains--rains which had filled a row of water-pots
quite full. Since she could not make those above her hear, it would be
as well, she thought, to secure herself from absolute starvation
before broad daylight brought life to the wilderness of roofs around
her; so she scrambled down a rough ladder of bamboo tied with string,
and, after a brief look into the square below, came back with some
parched grain she had found in a basket, and a pot of water. She would
not starve for that day. By this time it was dawn, and she crept into
her shelter, listening all the while for a sound from above; every now
and again venturing on a call. But there was no answer, and by degrees
it came to her that she must rely on herself only for safety. She was
not likely to be disturbed that day where she was, unless people came
to repair the thatch; and under cover of night she might surely creep
from roof to roof down to some alley. What alley? True, her goal now
lay behind her, but these roofs, set at every angle, might lead her
far from it. And how was she to know her own stair, her own house,
from the outside? She had passed into it in darkness and never left it
again. Then what sort of people lived in these houses through which
she must creep like a thief? Murderers, perhaps. Still it was her only
chance; and all that burning, blistering day, as she crouched between
the thatch and the wall, she was bolstering up her courage for the
effort. She could see the Ridge clearly from her hiding place. Ah! if
she had only the wings of the doves--those purple pigeons
which--circling from the great dome of the mosque---came to-feast
unchecked on the Indian corn! The people below, then, must be pious
folk.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302536">It was past midnight, and the silence of sleep had settled over the
city before she nerved herself to the chance, and crept down among the
corn. No difficulty in that; but to her surprise, a cresset was still
burning in the arcaded verandah below, sending three bars of light
across the square through which she must pass. It would be better to
wait awhile; but an hour slipped by and still the light gleamed into
the silence. Perhaps it had been forgotten. The<pb xml:id="fswater_1302535" n="343 FORWARD"/> possibility made her creep down the brick ladder, prepared
to creep up again if the silence proved deceptive, but what she saw
made her pause, hesitating. It was a woman reading from a large book
held in a book-rest. The Koran, of course. Kate recognised it at once,
for just such another had been part of the necessary furniture of her
roof. And what a beautiful face! Tender, refined, charming. Not the
face of a murderess, surely?--surely it might be trusted? Those three
months behind the veil had made Kate realise the emotionality of the
East; its instinctive sympathy with the dramatic element in life. She
remembered her sudden impulse in regard to the knife, and its effect
on Tiddu; she felt a similar impulse towards confidence here. Besides,
she knew that the doors might be locked below, and that her best
chance might be to throw herself on the mercy of this woman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302537">The next moment she was standing full in the light close to the
student, who started to her feet with a faint cry, gazing almost
incredulously at the figure so like her own, save for the jewels
gleaming among the white draperies.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302538"><hi rend="italic">Bibi</hi>,' she faltered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302539">'I am no <hi rend="italic">bibi</hi>,' interrupted Kate hurriedly
in Hindustani. 'I am a Christian--but a woman like yourself--a
mother. For the sake of yours--or the sake of your sons, if you are a
mother too--for the sake of what you love best--save me.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302540">'A Christian! a <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>!' In the pause of sheer
astonishment the two women stood facing each other, looking into each
other's eyes. Prince Abool-Bukr had been right when he said that Kate
Erlton reminded him of the Princess Fârkhoonda
Zamâni. Standing so, they showed strangely alike indeed, not in
feature, but in type; in the soul which looked out of the soft dark,
and the clear grey eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302541">'Save you?'--the faint echo was lost in a new sound, close at
hand--a careless voice humming a song--a step coming up the dark
stair.</p><q><l>'O mistress rare, divine!'</l></q><p xml:id="fswater_1302543">God and His Prophet! Abool himself! Newâsi flung her hands
up in sheer horror. Abool! and this Christian here! The next instant
with a fierce 'Keep still,' she had thrust Kate into the deepest
shadow and was out to bar the brick ladder with her tall white
grace. She had no time for<pb xml:id="fswater_1302542" n="344 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>
thought. One sentence beat on her brain--'for the sake of what you
love best, save me!' Yea! for <hi rend="italic">his</hi> sake this
strange woman must not be seen--he must not, should not guess she was
there!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302544">'Stand back, kind one, and let me pass,' came the gay voice
carelessly. It made Kate shudder back into further shadow, for she
knew now where she was; and but that she would have to pass those bars
of light would have essayed escape to the roofs again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302545">But Newâsi stood still as stone on the first step of the
stairs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302546">'Pass!' she repeated clearly, coldly. 'Art mad, Abool! that thou
comest hither with no excuse of drunkenness and alone, at this hour of
the night. For shame!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302547">Why, indeed, she asked herself wildly, had he come? He was not used
to do so. Could he have heard? Had he come on purpose? There was a
sound as if he retreated a step, and from the dark his voice came with
a wonder in it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302548">'What ails thee, Newâsi?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302549">'What ails me!' she echoed, 'What I have lacked too long. Just
anger at thy thoughtless ways. Go--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302550">'But I have that to tell thee of serious import that none but thou
must hear. That which will please thee. That which needs thy kind wise
eyes upon it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302551">'Then let them see it by daylight, not now. I will not,
Abool. Stand back, or I will call for help.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302552">The sound of retreat was louder this time, and a muttered curse
came with it; but the voice had a trace of anxiety in it now--anxiety
and anger.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302553">'Thou dost not mean it, kind one; thou canst not! When have I done
that which would make thee need help? Newâsi! be not a
fool. Remember it is I, Abool; Abool-Bukr who has a devil in him at
times!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302554">Did she not know it by this time? Was not that the reason why he
must not find this Christian? Why she must refuse him hearing?--though
it was true that he had a right to be trusted! In all those long
years, when had he failed to treat her tenderly, respectfully? As she
stood barring his way, where he had never before been denied entrance,
she felt as if she herself could have killed that strange woman for
being there--for coming between them.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302555" n="345 FORWARD"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302556">'Listen, Abool!' she said, stretching out her hands to find his in
the dark. 'I mean naught, dear, that is unkind. How could it be so
between me and thee? But 'tis not wise.' She paused, catching her
breath in a faint sob. He could not see her face, perhaps if he had,
he would have been less relentless.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302557">'Wherefore? Canst not trust thy nephew, fair aunt?' The sarcasm bit
deep.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302558">'Nephew! A truce, Abool, to this foolish tale,' she began hotly,
when he interrupted her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302559">'Of a surety, if the Princess Farkhoonda desires it! Yet would
Mirza Abool-Bukr still like to know wherefore he is not received?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302560">His tone sent a thrill of terror through her, his use of the name
he hated warned her that his temper was rising--the devil
awakening.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302561">'Canst not see, dear,' she pleaded, trying to keep the hands he
would have drawn from hers--'folk have evil minds.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302562">He gave an ugly laugh. 'Since when hast thou begun to think of thy
good name, like other women, Newâsi. But if it be so, if all my
virtue--and God knows 'tis ill-got--is to go for naught, let it
end.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302563">She heard him, felt him turn, and a wild despair surged up in
her. Which was worst? To let him go in anger beyond the reach of her
controlling hand mayhap--go to unknown evils--or chance this one?
Since--since at the worst murder and death might be concealed!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302564">God and His Prophet! What a thought. No! she would plead again--she
would stoop--she would keep him at--at any price.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302565">'Listen!' she whispered passionately, leading towards him in the
dark, 'dost ask since when I have feared for my good name? Canst not
guess?--Abool! what--what does a women, as I am, fear--save
herself--save her own love--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302566">There was an instant's silence, and then his reckless jeering laugh
jarred loud.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302567">'So it has come at last! and there is another woman for
kisses. That is an end indeed! Did I not tell thee we should quarrel
over it some day? Well, be it so, Princess! I will take my virtue
elsewhere.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302569">She stood as if turned to stone, listening to his retreating steps,
listening to his nonchalant humming of the old refrain<pb xml:id="fswater_1302568" n="346 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> as he passed through the courtyard into
the alley. Then, without a word, but quivering with passion, she
turned to where Kate cowered, and dragged her by main force to the
stairs where, a minute before, she had sacrificed everything for
her. No! not for her, for him!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302570">'Go,' she said bitterly. 'Go! and my curse go with you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302571">Kate fled before the anger she saw but did not understand. Yet as
she flew down the steep stairs she paused involuntarily to listen to
the sound--a sound which needed no intrepreter as the liquid Persian
had done--of a woman sobbing as if her heart would break.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302572">She had no time, however, even for wonder, and the next instant
she, was out in the alley, turning to the right. For the knowledge
that it was the Princess Farkhoonda who had helped her, gave the clue
to her position. But the house, the stair? How could she know it? She
must try them one after another--since she would surely know the
landing--the door she had so often opened and shut? Still it was
perilously near dawn ere she found what she felt was the right one;
but it was padlocked!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302573">They must have gone; gone and left her alone!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302574">For the first time, ghastly, unreasoning fear seized on her; she
could have beaten at the door and screamed her claim to be let in; and
even when the rush of terror passed, she sat stupidly on the step, not
even wondering what to do next. Till suddenly she remembered that she
had keys in her pocket. That of the inner padlock, certainly; perhaps
of the outer one, also, since Tara had given up using her duplicate
altogether.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302575">She had it; and five minutes after, having satisfied herself that
the roof remained as it was--that it was merely empty for a time--she
tried to feel grateful. But the loneliness, the dimness, were too much
for her fatigue, her excitement. So once more the sound which needs no
intrepreter rose on the warm soft night.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302577">It was two days after this that Tiddu held a secret consultation
with Soma and Tara. The Agha-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, he said,
was getting desperate. He was losing his head, as the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> did over women-folk, and he must be got out
of the city. It was not as if he did any good by staying in it. The
<hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was either dead, or safely concealed. There
was no alternative, unless, indeed, she had already been passed out to
the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302576" n="347 FORWARD"/> Ridge. There was talk of that sort among
Hodson's spies, and he was going to utilise the fact and persuade the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> to creep out to the camp and see. Soma
could pass him out, and would not pass him in again; which was
fortunate, since folk in addition to protecting masters had to make
money, when every other corn-carrier in the place was coining it by
smuggling gold and silver out of the city for the rich merchants!
Tara, with a sudden fierce exultation in her sombre eyes, agreed. Let
the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> go back to his own life, she said;
let him go to safety, and leave her free. As for the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>, the master had done enough for her. And Soma,
sulky and lowering with the dull glow of opium in his brain--for the
drug was his only solace now--swore that Tiddu was right. Delhi was no
place for the master. And once out of it, the fighting would keep him:
he knew him of old. As for the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>, he would not
harm her, as Tara had once suggested he should. That dream was
over. The <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> were the true masters; they
had men who could lead men; not princes in Kashmir shawls who couldn't
understand a word of what you said, and mere <hi rend="italic">soubadars</hi> cocked up, but real <hi rend="italic">Colonells</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Generâls.</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302578">The result of this being that on the night of the 11th, between
midnight and dawn, Jim Douglas, with that elation which came to him
always at the prospect of action, prepared to slip out of the sally
port by the Magazine, disguised as a sepoy. This was to please
Soma. To please Tiddu, however, he wore underneath this disguise, the
old staff uniform from the theatrical properties. It reminded him of
Alice Gissing, making him whisper another '<hi rend="italic">bravo</hi>' to the memory of the woman whom he had
buried under the orange-trees in the crimson-netted shroud made of an
officer's scarf.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302579">Nevertheless Tiddu's remark that an English uniform would be the
safest, once he was beyond the city, sent sadness flying, in its frank
admission that the tide had turned.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302580">Turned, indeed! The certainty came with a great throb of fierce joy
as, half-an-hour afterwards, slipping past the gardens of Ludlow
Castle, he found himself in the thick of English bayonets, and felt
grateful for the foresight of the old staff uniform. They were on
their way to surprise and take the picquet, not to defend but to
attack.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302582">The opportunity was too good to be lost. There was no hurry; he had
arranged to remain three days on the Ridge,<pb xml:id="fswater_1302581" n="348 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> and he might not have another opportunity of a free
fair fight.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302583">He had forgotten every woman in the world, everything save the
welcome silence before him as he turned and stole through the trees
also, sword in hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302584">By all that was lucky and well-planned: the picquet must be asleep!
There was not a sound save the faint crackle of stealthy feet, almost
lost in the insistent quiver of the cicalas. No! there was a challenge
at last within a foot or two.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302585">'Who--kum--dar?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302586">And swift as an echo a young voice beside him replied jibingly:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302587">'It's me, Pandy! Take that.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302588">It's me! Just so; me with a vengeance. For the right attack and the
left were both well up. There was a short, sharp volley, then the
welcome familiar order. A cheer, a clatter, a rush and clashing with
the bayonets. It seemed but half-a-minute before Jim Douglas found
himself among the guns, slashing at a dazed artillery-man who had a
port-fire in his hand. So the artillery on either side never had a
chance, and Major Erlton, riding up with the 9th Lancers as the
central attack, found that bit of the fighting over. The picquet was
taken, the mutineers had fled citywards leaving four guns behind them;
and against one of these, as the Major rode close to gloat over it,
leant a man whom he recognised at once.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302589">'My God! Douglas,' he said, 'where--where's Kate?--where's my
wife?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302590">It was rather an abrupt transition of thought, and Jim Douglas, who
was feeling; rather queer from something--he scarcely knew
what--looked up at the speaker doubtfully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302591">'Oh! it is you, Major Erlton,' he said slowly. 'I thought--I mean I
hoped she was here--if she isn't--why, I suppose I'd better go
back.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302592">He took his arm off the gun and half-stumbled forward, when Major
Erlton flung himself from his horse and laid hold of him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302593">'You're hit, man!--the blood's pouring from your sleeve. Here off
with your coat, sharp!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302594">'I can't think why it bleeds so?' said Jim Douglas feebly, looking
down at a clean cut at the inside of the elbow front which the blood
was literally spouting. 'It is nothing--nothing at all.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302595" n="349 FORWARD"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302596">The Major gave a short laugh. 'Take the go out of you a bit,
though. I'll get a tourniquet on sharp, and send you up in a
dhooli.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302597">'What an unlucky devil I am,' muttered Jim Douglas to himself, and
the Major did not deny it. He was in a hurry to be off again with the
party told to clear the Koodsia Gardens; which they did successfully
before sunrise, when the expedition returned to camp cheering like
demons and dragging in the captured guns, on which some of the wounded
men sat triumphantly. It was their first real success since
Budli-ke-serai, two months before; and they were in wild spirits.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302598">Even the doctor, fresh from shaking his head over many a form
lifted helplessly from the dhoolis, was jubilant as he sorted Jim
Douglas's arm.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302599">'Keep you here ten days or so I should say. There's always a chance
of its breaking out again till the wound is quite healed. Never mind!
You can go into Delhi with the rest of us, before then.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302600">'Yoicks forward!' cried a wounded lad in the cot close by. The
doctor turned sharply. 'If you don't keep quiet, Jones, I'll send you
back to Meerut. And you too, Maloney. I've told you to lie still a
dozen times.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302601">'Sure, docther dear, ye couldn't be so cruel,' said a big Irishman
sitting at the foot of his bed so as to get nearer to a new arrival
who was telling the tale of the fight. 'And me able-bodied and
spoiling to be at me wurrk this three days.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302602">'It's a curious fact,' remarked the doctor to Jim Douglas as he
finished bandaging him, 'the hospital has been twice as insubordinate
since Nicholson came in. The men seem to think we are to assault Delhi
to-morrow. But we can't till the siege train comes, of course. So you
may be in at the death!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302603">Jim Douglas felt glad and sorry in a breath.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302604">Finally he told himself he could let decision stand over for a day
or two. He must see Hodson first, and find out if the letter he had
had from his spies about an Englishwoman concealed in Delhi, referred
to Kate Erlton.</p></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1302605" n="350 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><div xml:id="fswater_0502" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II<lb/>BIT, BRIDLES, AND SPURS</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302606">THE letter, however, did not refer to Kate; though, curiously
enough, the Englishwoman it concerned had been, and still was
concealed in an Afghân's house. Kate, then, had not been the
only Englishwoman in Delhi. There was a certain consolation in the
thought, since what was being done for one person by kindly natives
might very well be done for another. Besides, removed as he was now
from the fret and strain of actual search, Jim Douglas admitted
frankly to Major Hodson that he was right in saying that Mrs. Erlton
must either have come to an end of her troubles altogether, or have
found friends better able, perhaps, than he to protect her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302607">Regarding the first possibility, also, Major Hodson was
sceptical. He had hundreds of spies in the city. Such a piece of good
luck as the discovery of a Christian must have been noised
abroad. They had not mentioned it; he did not, therefore, believe it
had occurred. He would, however, enquire, and till the answer came it
would be foolish to go back to the city. Jim Douglas admitted this
also; but as the days passed, the desire to return increased;
especially when Major Erlton came to see him, which he did with
dutiful regularity. Jim Douglas could not help admiring him when he
stood, stiff' and square, thanking him as Englishnien thank their
fellows for what they know to be beyond thanks.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302608">'I am sure no one could have done more, and I know I couldn't have
done a quarter so much--and I'm grateful,' he said awkwardly. Then
with the best intentions, born from a real pity for the haggard man
who sat on the edge of his cot looking as men do after a struggle of
weeks with malarial fever, he added, 'And the luck has been a bit
against you all the time, hasn't it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302609">'As yet, perhaps,' replied Jim Douglas, feeling inclined then and
there to start citywards, 'but the game isn't over. When I go
back--'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302610" n="351 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302611">'Hodson says you could do no good,' continued the big man still
with the best intentions.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302612">'I don't agree with him,' retorted the other sharply.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302613">'Perhaps not--but--but I wouldn't, if I were you. Or--rather--<hi rend="italic">I</hi> should, of course--only--you see it is different
for me. She--' Major Erlton paused, finding it difficult to explain
himself. The memory of that last letter he had written to Kate was
always with him, making him feel she was not, in a way, his wife. He
had never regretted writing it. He had scarcely thought what would
happen if she came back from the dead, as it were, to answer it; for
he hated thought. Even now the complexity of his emotions irritated
him, and he broke through them almost brutally. 'She was my wife, you
see. But you had nothing to do with it; so you had better leave it
alone. You've done enough already. And as I said before, I'm
grateful.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302614">So he had stalked away leaving his hearer frowning. It was
true. The luck had been against him. But what right had it to be so?
Above all, what right had that big brutal fellow to say so? There he
was going off to win more distinction, no doubt. He would end by
getting the Victoria Cross, and confound him! from what people said of
him, he would well deserve it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302616">While he ? Even these two days had brought his failure home to
him. And yet he told himself, that if he had failed to save one
Englishwoman, others had failed to save hundreds. Fresh as he was to
the facts, they seemed to him almost incredible. As he wandered round
the Ridge inspecting that rear-guard of graves, or sat talking to some
of the thousand-and-odd sick and wounded in hospital, listening to
endless tales of courage, pluck, sheer dogged resistance, he realised
at what a terrible cost that armed force--varying from three to six
thousand men--had simply clung to the rocks and looked at the
city. There seemed enough heroism in it to have removed mountains; and
coming upon him, not in the monotonous sequence of day-to-day
experience, but in a single impression, the futility of it left him
appalled. So did the news of the world beyond Delhi, heard, reliably,
for the first time. Briefly, England was everywhere on her defence. It
seemed to him as if from that mad dream of conquest within the city,
he had passed to as strange a dream of defeat. And why? The
fire--unchecked at first--<pb xml:id="fswater_1302615" n="352 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/>had blazed up with fresh fuel in place after place and
left?--nothing!--not a single attempt to wrest the government of the
country from us; not even an organised resistance, when once the order
to advance had been given. Had there been some mysterions influence
abroad making men blind to the truth?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302617">It was about to pass away if there had been, he felt, when on the
14th, he watched John Nicholson re-enter the Ridge at the head of his
column. And many others felt the same, without in any way disparaging
those who for long months of defence had borne the burden and heat of
the day. They simply saw that Fate had sent a new factor into the
problem, that the old order was changing; the Defence was to be
Attack.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302618">And why not, with that reinforcement of fine fighting men? Played
in by the band of the 8th, amid cheering and counter-cheering, which
almost drowned the music, it seemed fit--as the joke ran--if not to
face hell itself, at any rate to take <hi rend="italic">Pandy-monium</hi>. The 52nd Regiment looked like the
mastiff to which its leader had likened it. The 2nd Sikhs were
admittedly the biggest fellows ever seen. The wild Mooltânee
Horse sat their lean Beloochees with the loose security of seat which
tells of men born to the saddle.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302619">Jim Douglas noted these things like his fellows; but what sent that
thrill of confidence through him, was the look on many a face, as at
some pause or turn, it caught a glimpse of the General's figure. It
was that heroic figure itself, seen for the first time, riding ahead
of all with no unconsciousness of the attention it attracted; but with
a self-reliant acceptance of the fact--as far from modesty as it was
from vanity--that here rode John Nicholson, ready to do what John
Nicholson could do. But in the pale face, made paler by the darkness
of the beard, there was more than this. There was an almost languid
patience, as if the owner knew that the men around said of him, 'If
ever there is a desperate deed to do in India, John Nicholson is the
man to do it,' and was biding his time to fulfill their hopes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302621">The look haunted Jim Douglas all day, stimulating him
strangely. Here was a man, he felt, who was in the grip of Fate, but
who gave back the grip so firmly that his Fate could not escape
him. Gave it back frankly, freely, as one man might grip another's
hand in friendship. And then he<pb xml:id="fswater_1302620" n="353 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/> smiled, thinking that John Nicholson's hand-clasp would go a
long way in giving any one a help over a hard stile. If he had had a
lead-over like that after the smash came; if even now?...Idle
thoughts, he told himself; and all because the picturesqueness of a
man's outward appearance had taken his fancy, his imagination. For all
he knew, or was ever likely to know--He had been sitting idly on the
edge of his cot in the tiny tent Major Erlton had lent him, having in
truth nothing better to do, and now a voice from the blaze and blare
of heat and light outside startled him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302622">'May I come in--John Nicholson?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302623">He almost stammered in his surprise; but without waiting for more
than a word the General walked in, alone. He was still in full
uniform; and surely no man could become it more, thought Jim Douglas
involuntarily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302624">'I have heard your story, Mr. Douglas,' he began in a sonorous but
very pleasant voice. 'It is a curious one. And I was curious to see
you. You must know so much'--he paused, fixed his eyes in a perfectly
unembarrassed stare on his host's face, then said suddenly with a sort
of old-fashioned courtesy. 'Sit you down again, please; there isn't a
chair, I see, but the cot will stand two of us. If it doesn't it will
be clearly my fault.' He smiled kindly--'Wounded too--I didn't know
that.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302625">'A scratch, sir,' put in his hearer hastily, fighting shy even of
that commiseration. 'I had a little fever in the city; that is
all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302626">The bright hazel eyes, with a hint of sunlight in them, took rather
an absent look. 'I should like to have done it myself. I've tried that
sort of thing; but they always find me out.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302627">'I fancy you must be rather difficult to disguise,' began Jim
Douglas with a smile, when John Nicholson plunged straight into the
heart of things.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302628">'You must know a lot I want to know. Of course I've seen Hodson and
his letters; but this is different. First--Will the city fight?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302629">'As well as it knows how, and it knows better than it did.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302631">'So I fancied. Hodson said not. By the way, he told me that you
declared his Intelligence department was simply<pb xml:id="fswater_1302630" n="354 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> perfect. And his accounts--I mean his
information--wonderfully accurate.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302632">'I did, indeed, sir,' replied Jim Douglas, smiling again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302633">Nicholson gave him a sharp look. 'And he is a wonderfully fine
soldier too, sir; one of the finest we have. Wilson is sending him out
this afternoon to punish those Rânghars at Rohtuck--I don't
know why I should present you with this information, Mr. Douglas?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302634">'Don't you, sir?' was the cool reply; 'I think I do. Major Hodson
may have his faults, sir, but the Ridge couldn't do without him. And
I'm glad to hear he is going out. It is time we punished those chaps;
time we got some grip on the country again.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302635">The General's face cleared. 'Hm,' he said, 'you don't mince
matters; but I don't think we lost much grip in the Punjâb. And
as for punishments! Do you know over two thousand have been executed
already?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302636">'I didn't, sir; though I knew Sir John's hand was out. But, if
you'll excuse me, we don't want the hangings now--they can come
by-and-bye. We want to lick them--show them we are not really in a
blind funk.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302637">'You use strong language too, sir--very strong language.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302638">'I did not say we <hi rend="italic">were</hi> in one,' began Jim Douglas eagerly, when a
voice asking if General Nicholson were within interrupted him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302639">'He is,' replied the sonorous voice calmly. 'Come in, Hodson; and I
hope you are prepared to fight.' The bright hazel eyes met Jim
Douglas's with a distinct twinkle in them; but Major Hodson
entering--a perfect blaze of scarlet and fawn and gold, loose, lank,
lavish--gave the speech a different turn.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302640">'I hope you'll excuse the intrusion sir,' he said, saluting, as it
were, loudly, 'but being certain I owed this piece of luck to your
kind offices I ventured to follow you. And as for the fighting, sir,
trust Hodson's horse to give a good account of itself.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302641">'I do, Major, I do,' replied Nicholson gravely, despite the
twinkle, 'but at present I want you to fight Mr. Douglas for me. He
suggests we are all in a blind funk.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302643">With any one else Jim Douglas might have refused this cool
demand--for it was little else--that he should defend his statement
against a man who in himself was a refutation<pb xml:id="fswater_1302642" n="355 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/> of it, who was a type of the most reckless
dare-devil courage and dash; but the thought of that umpire, ready to
give an overwhelming thrust at any time, roused his temper and
pugnacity.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302644">'I'm not conscious of being in one myself,' said the Major, turning
with a swing and a brief 'How do Douglas.' He was the most martial of
figures in the last-developed uniform of the Flamingoes, or the
Ring-tailed Roarers, or the <hi rend="italic">Aloo
Bokhâra's</hi>, as Hodson's levies were called indiscriminately
during their lengthy process of dress-evolution: 'And what is more, I
don't understand what you mean, sir!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302645">'General Nicholson does, I think,' replied the other. 'But I will
go further than I did, sir,' he added, facing the General boldly: 'I
only said that the natives thought we were in a blind funk. I now
assert that they had a right to say so. We never stirred hand or foot
for a whole month.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302646">'Oh! I give you in Meerut,' interrupted Hodson hastily. 'It was
pitiable. Our leaders lost their heads.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302647">'Not only our leaders. We all lost them. From that moment to this
it seems to me we have never been calm.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302648">'Calm!' echoed Hodson disdainfully, 'Who wants to be calm? Who
would be calm with those massacred women and children to avenge.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302649">'Exactly so. The horrors of those ghastly murders got on our
nerves, and no wonder. We exaggerated the position from the first; we
exaggerate the dangers of it now.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302650">'Of taking Delhi, you mean?' interrupted Nicholson drily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302651">Jim Douglas smiled. 'No, sir! Even you will find that difficult. I
meant the ultimate danger to our rule--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302652">'There you mistake utterly,' put in Hodson magnificently. 'We mean
to win--we admit no danger. There isn't an Englishman, or, thank
heaven, an Englishwoman--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302653">'Is the crisis so desperate that we need levy the ladies?' asked
his adversary sarcastically. 'Personally I want to leave them out of
the question as much as I can. It is their intrusion into it which has
done the mischief. I don't want to minimise these horrors; but if we
could forget those massacres--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302654">'Forget them! I hope to God every Englishman will remember them
when the time comes to avenge them! Ay and make the murderers remember
them too.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302655" n="356 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302656">'If I had them in my power to-day,' put in the sonorous voice, 'and
knew I was to die to-morrow, I would inflict the most excruciating
tortures I could think of on them with an easy conscience.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302657">'Bravo! sir,' cried Hodson, 'and I'd do executioner gladly.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302658">John Nicholson's face flinched slightly. 'There is generally a
common hangman, I believe,' he said; then turned on Jim Douglas with
bent brows: 'And you sir?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302659">'I would kill them, sir, as I would kill a mad dog, in the quickest
way handy; as I'd kill every man found with arms in his hands. Treason
is a worse crime than murder to us now; and by God! if I tortured any
one it would be the men who betrayed the garrison at Cawnpore. Yet
even there, in our only real collapse, what has happened? It is
reoccupied already--the road to it is hung with dead
bodies--Havelock's march is one long procession of success. Yet we
count ourselves beleaguered. Why? I can't understand it! Where has an
order to charge, to advance boldly, met with a reverse? It seems to me
that but for these massacres, this fear for women and children, we
could hold our own gaily. Look at Lucknow--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302660">'Yes, Lucknow,' assented Hodson savagely--'Sir Henry, the bravest,
gentlest, dead! Women and children pent up--by Heaven! it's sickening
to think what may have happened.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302661">John Nicholson shot a quick glance at Jim Douglas.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302662">'It proves my contention,' said the latter. 'Think of it! Fifteen
hundred, English and natives, in a weak position with not even a
palisade in some places between them and five times their number of
trained soldiers backed by the wildest, wickedest, wantonest town
rabble in India! What does it mean? Make every one of the fifteen
hundred a paladin, and, by heaven! they <hi rend="italic">are</hi>
heroes.--Still, what does it mean?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302663">He spoke to the General, but he was silent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302664">'Mean?' echoed Hodson. 'Palpably that the foe is contemptible. So
he is. Pandy can't fight--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302665">'He fought well enough for us in the past. I know my regiment'--Jim
Douglas caught himself up hard--'I believe they will fight for us
again. The truth is that half, even of the army, does not want to
fight, and the country does not mean fight at all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302666">'Delhi?' came the dry voice again.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302667" n="357 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302668">'Delhi is exceptional. Besides, it can do nothing else
now. Remember we condemned it, unheard, on the 8th of June.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302669">'I told you that before, sir; didn't I?' put in Hodson quickly. 'If
we had gone in on the 11th, as I suggested.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302670">'You wouldn't have succeeded,' replied Jim Douglas
coolly. Nicholson rose with a smile.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302671">'Well we are going to succeed now. So good-luck in the meantime,
Hodson. Put bit and bridle on the Rânghars. Show them we can't
have 'em disturbing the public peace, and kicking up futile
rows. Eh--Mr. Douglas?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302672">'No fear, sir!' said Hodson effusively. 'The Ring-tailed Roarers
are not in a blind funk. I only wish that I was as sure that the
politicals will keep order when we've made it. I had to do it twice
over at Bhâgput. And it is hard, sir, when one has fagged
horses and men to death, to be told one has exceeded orders--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302673">'If you served under me, Major Hodson,' said the General, with a
sudden freeze of formality, 'that would be impossible. My instructions
are always to do everything that can be done.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302674">Jim Douglas felt he could well believe it, as with a regret that
the interview was over, he held the flap of the tent aside for the
imperial figure to pass out. But it lingered in the blaze of sunshine
after Major Hodson had jingled off.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302675">'You are right in some things, Mr. Douglas,' said the sonorous
voice suddenly: 'I'd ask no finer soldiers than some of those against
us. By-and-bye, unless I'm wrong, men of their stock will be our best
war weapons; for, mind you, war is a primitive art and needs a
primitive people. And the country isn't against us. If it were, we
shouldn't be standing here. It is too busy ploughing, Mr. Douglas;
this rain is points in our favour. As for the women and children--poor
souls'--his voice softened infinitely--'they have been in our way
terribly; but--we shall fight all the better for that,
by-and-bye. Meanwhile we have got to smash Delhi. The odds are bigger
than they were at first. But Baird Smith will sap us in somehow, and
then'--he paused, looking kindly at Jim Douglas, and said--'you had
better stop and go in with--with the rest of us.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302676">'I think not, sir--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302677">'Why? Because of that poor lady? Woman again--eh?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302678">'In a way; besides, I have really nothing else to do.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302679" n="358 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302680">John Nicholson looked at him for a moment from head to foot; then
said sharply--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302681">'I don't know, sir. I give my personal staff plenty of work.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302682">For an instant the offer took his hearer's breath away, and he
stood silent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302683">'I'm afraid not, sir,' he said at last, though from the first he
had known what his answer must be. 'I--I can't, that's the fact. I was
cashiered from the army fifteen years ago.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302684">General Nicholson stepped back a step, with sheer anger in his
face. 'Then what do you mean, sir, by wearing Her Majesty's
uniform?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302685">Jim Douglas looked down hastily on old Tiddu's staff properties,
which he had quite forgotten. They had passed muster in the darkness
of the tent, but here, in the sunlight, looked inconcievably worn, and
shabby, and unreal. He smiled rather bitterly; then held out his
sleeve to show the braiding.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302686">'It's a general's coat, sir,' he said defiantly. 'God knows what
old duffer it belonged to; but I might have worn it first- instead of
second-hand, if I hadn't been a d----d young one.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302687">The splendid figure drew itself together formally, but the other's
pride was up too, and so for a minute the two men faced each other
honestly, Nicholson's eyes narrowing under their bent brows.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302688">'What was it? A woman, I expect.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302689">'Perhaps. I don't see that it matters.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302690">A faint smile of approval rather took from the sternness of the
military salute. 'Not at all. That ends it, of course.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302691">'Of course.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302692">Not quite; for ere Jim Douglas could drop the curtain between
himself and that brilliant, successful figure, it had turned sharply
and laid a hand on his shoulder. A curiously characteristic
hand--large, thin, smooth and white as a woman's, with a grip in it
beyond most men's.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302693">'You have a vile habit of telling the truth to superior officers,
Mr. Douglas. So have I. Shake hands on it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302695">With that hand on his shoulder, that clasp on his, Jim Douglas felt
as if he were in the grip of Fate itself, and following John
Nicholson's example, gave it back frankly, freely. So, suddenly, the
whole face before him melted into perfect friendliness. 'Stick to it,
man--stick to it! Save<pb xml:id="fswater_1302694" n="359 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/> that
poor lady--or--or kill somebody! It's what we are all doing. As for
the rest'--the smile was almost boyish--'I may get the sack myself
before the general's coat. I'm insubordinate enough, they tell me--but
I shall have taken Delhi first. So--so good-luck to you!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302696">As he walled away, he seemed to the eyes watching him bigger, more
kinglike, more heroic than ever; perhaps because they were dim with
tears. But as Jim Douglas went off with a new cheerfulness to see
Hodson's Horse jingle out on their lesson of peace, he told himself
that the old scoundrel Tiddu had once more been right. <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn</hi> had the Great Gift. He could take a man's
heart out and look at it, and put it back sounder than it had been for
years. He could put his own heart into a whole camp and make it
believe it was its own.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302697">Such a clattering of hoofs and clinking of bits and bridles had
been heard often before, but never with such gay
lightheartedness. Only two days before a lesson had been given to the
city. There had been no more harassing of picquets at night. Now the
arm of the law was going coolly to reach out forty miles. It was a
change indeed. And more than Jim Douglas watched the sun set red on
the city wall that evening with a certain content in their hearts. As
for him, he seemed still to feel that grip, and hear the voice saying
'Stick to it, man, stick to it! save that poor lady or kill
somebody. It's what we are all doing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302698">He sat dreaming over the whole strange dream with a curious sense
of comradship and sympathy through it all, until the glow faded and
left the city dark and stern beneath the storm-clouds which had been
gathering all day.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302699">Then he rose and went back to his tent cheerfully. He would run no
needless risks; he would not loose his head; but as soon as the
doctors said it was safe, he would find and save Kate, or--<hi rend="italic">kill somebody</hi>. That was the whole duty of man.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302700">Kate, however, had already been found, or rather she had never been
lost; and when Tara, a few hours after Jim Douglas slipped out of the
city, had gone to the roof to fetch away her spinning-wheel, and
finding the door padlocked on the inside, had in sheer bewilderment
tried the effect of a signal knock, Kate had let her in as if, so poor
Tara told herself, it was all to begin over again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302702">All over again, even though she had spent those few hours<pb xml:id="fswater_1302701" n="360 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> of freedom in a perfect
passion of purification, so that she might return to her saintship
once more.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302703">The gold circlets were gone already, her head was shaven, the
coarse white shroud had replaced the crimson scarf. Yet here was the
<hi rend="italic">mem</hi> asking for the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, and setting her blood on fire with vague
jealousies.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302704">She squatted down almost helplessly on the floor answering all
Kate's eager questions, until suddenly in the midst of it all she
started to her feet, and flung up her arms in the old wild cry for
righteousness, 'I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>! Before God! I am
<hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302705">Then she had said with a gloomy calm, 'I will bring the meat more
food and drink. But I must think. Tiddu is away; Soma will not help. I
am alone; but I am <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302706">Kate, frightened at her wild eyes, felt relieved when she was left
alone, and inclined not to open the door to her again. She could
manage, she told herself, as she had managed for a few days, and by
that time Mr. Greyman would have come back. But as the long hours
dragged by, giving her endless opportunity of thought, she began to
ask herself why he should come back at all. She had not realised at
first that he had escaped; that he was safe; that he was, as it were,
quit of her. But he was, and he must remain so. A new decision, almost
a content, came to her with the suggestion. She was busy in a moment
over details. To begin with, no news must be sent. Then, in case he
were to return, she must leave the roof. Tara might do so much for
her, especially if it was made clear that it was for the master's
benefit. But Tara might never return. There had been that in her
manner which hinted at such a possibility, and the stores she had
brought in had been unduly lavish. In that case, Kate told herself,
she would creep out some night, go back to the Princess Farkhoonda,
and see if she would not help. If not, there was always the
alternative of ending everything by going into the streets boldly and
declaring herself a Christian. But she would appeal to these two women
first.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302708">And as she sat resolving this, the two women were cursing her in
their inmost hearts. For there had been no bangings of drums or
thrumming of <hi rend="italic">sutâras</hi> on Newâsi's
roof these three days. Abool-Bukr had broken away from her kind
detaining hand, and gone back to the Intrigues of the Palace. So the
Mufti's quarter benefited in decent quiet, during<pb xml:id="fswater_1302707" n="361 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/> which the poor Princess began that process of
weeping her eyes out, which left her blind at last. But not blind
yet. And so she sate swaying gracefully before the book-rest on which
lay the Word of her God, her voice quavering sometimes over the
monotonous chant, as she tried to distil comfort to her own heart from
the proposition that 'He is Might and Right.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302709">And far away in another quarter of the town Tara, crouched up
before a mere block of stone, half-hidden in flowers, was telling her
beads feverishly. '<hi rend="italic">Râm-Râm-Sita-Râm!</hi>' That was
the form she used for a whole tragedy of appeal and aspiration,
remorse, despair, and hope. And as she muttered on, looking dully at
the little row of platters she had presented to the shrine that
morning--going far beyond necessity in her determination to be
heard--the groups of women coming in to lay a fresh chaplet among the
withered ones and give a '<hi rend="italic">jow</hi>' to the
deep-toned bell hung in the archway in order to attract the god's
attention to their offering, paused to whisper among themselves of her
piety; while more than once a widow crept close to kiss the edge of
her veil, humbly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302710">It was balm indeed! It was peace. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>
might starve, she told herself fiercely, but she would be <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. After all the strain, and the pain, and the
wondering ache at her heart, she had come back to her own life. This
she understood. Let the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> keep to their
own. This was hers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302711">The sun danced in motes through the branches of the peepul tree
above the little shrine, the squirrels chirruped among them, the
parrots chattered, sending a rain of soft little figs to fall with a
faint sound on the hard stones, and still Tara counted her beads
feverishly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302712">'<hi rend="italic">Ari!</hi> sisters! she is a saint indeed. She
was here at dawn and she prays still,' said the women, coming in the
lengthening shadows with odd little bits of feastings; a handful of
cocoa-nut chips, a platter of flour, a dish of curds, or a dab of
butter.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302713">'<hi rend="italic">Râm-Râm-Sita-Râm,
Râm-Râm-Sita-Râm.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302715">And all the while poor Tara was thinking of the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> face, if he ever found out that she had
left the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> to starve. It was almost dark when
she stood up, abandoning the useless struggle; so she waited to see
the sacred Circling of the Lights and get her little sip of holy water
before she went<pb xml:id="fswater_1302714" n="362 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> back to her
perch among the pigeons, to put on the crimson scarf and the gold
circlets again--since it was hopeless trying to be a saint till she
had done what she had promised the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> she
would do. She must go back to the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>
first.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302716">But Kate, opening the door to her with eyes a-glitter, and a whole
cut-and-dried-plan for the future, almost took her breath away, and
reduced her into looking at the Englishwoman with a sort of fear.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302717">The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will be <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> too,' she said stupidly, after listening
awhile. 'The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will shave her head and put
away her jewels! The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will wear a widow's
shroud and sweep the floor, saying she comes from Bengal to serve the
saint?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302718">'I do not care, Tara, how it is done. Perhaps you may have a better
plan. But we must prevent the master from finding me again. He has
done too much for me as it is; you know he has,' replied Kate, her
eyes shining like stars with determination. 'I only want you to save
him; that is all. You may take me away and kill me if you like; and if
you won't help me to hide, I'll go out into the streets and let them
kill me there. I will not have him risk his life for me again.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302719">'<hi rend="italic">Râm-Râm-Sita-Râm</hi>,'
said Tara under her breath. That settled it; and at dawn the next day
Tara stood in her odd little perch above the shrine among the pigeons,
looking down curiously at the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> who, wearied
out by her long midnight walk through the city and all the excitement
of the day, had dozed off on a bare mat in the corner, her head
resting on her arm. Three months ago Kate could not have slept without
a pillow; now, as she lay on the hard ground, her face looked soft and
peaceful in sheer honest dreamless sleep. But Tara had not slept; that
was to be told from the anxious strain of her eyes. She had sate
out--since she returned home--on her two square yards of balcony in
the waning moonlight, looking down on the unseen shrine, hidden by the
tall peepul tree whose branches she could almost touch.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302721">Would the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> really be <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>? she had asked herself again and
again. Would she do so much for the master? Would she--would she
really shave her head? A grim smile of incredulity came to Tara's
face, then a quick, sharp frown of pain. If she did, she must care
very much for the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302720" n="363 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/><hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>. Besides, she had no right to do it! The <hi rend="italic">mems</hi> were never <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. They
married again many times. And then this <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was
married to some one else. No! she would never shave her head for a
strange man. She might take off her jewels, she might even sweep the
floor. But shave her head? never!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302722">But supposing she did?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302723">The oddest jumble of jealousy and approbation filled Tara's
heart. So, as the yellow dawn broke, she bent over Kate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302724">'Wake, <hi rend="italic">mem sahib</hi>!' she said, 'wake. It is
time to prepare for the day. It is time to get ready.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302725">Kate started up, rubbing her eyes, wondering where she was; as in
truth she well might, for she had never been in such a place
before. The long, low slip of a room was absolutely empty save for a
reed mat or two; but every inch of it, floor, walls, ceiling, was
freshly plastered with mud. That on the floor was still wet, for Tara
had been at work on it already. Over each doorway hung a faded
chaplet, on each lintel was printed the mark of a bloody hand, and
round and about, in broad finger-marks of red and white, ran the
eternal <hi rend="italic">Râm-Râm-Sita-Râm</hi>
in Sanskrit letterings. In truth, Tara's knowledge of secular and
religious learning was strictly confined to this sentence. There was a
faint smell of incense in the room, rising from a tiny brazier sending
up a blue spiral flame of smoke before a two-inch-high brass idol with
an elephant's head which sate on a niche in the wall. It represented
Eternal Wisdom. But Kate did not know this. Nor in a way did Tara. She
only knew it was Gunesh-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi>. And outside was
the yellow dawn, the purple pigeons beginning to coo and sidle, the
quivering hearts of the peepul leaves.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302726">'I have everything ready for the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>,' began
Tara hurriedly, 'if she will take off her jewels.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302727">'You must pull this one open for me, Tara,' said Kate, holding out
her arm with the gold bangle on it. 'The master put it on for me, and
I have never had it off since.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302728">Tara knew that as well as she; knew that the master must have put
it on, since <hi rend="italic">she</hi> had not; had, in fact, watched it with jealous eyes
over and over again. And there was the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>
without it, smiling over the scantiness and intricacies of a coarse
cotton shroud.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302730">'There is the hair yet,' said Tara with quite a catch in her<pb xml:id="fswater_1302729" n="364 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> voice;' if the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will undo the plaits, I will go round to the
old <hi rend="italic">poojârni's</hi> and get the loan of her
razor--she only lives up the next stair.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302731">'We shall have to snip it off first,' said Kate quite eagerly, for,
in truth, she was becoming interested in her own adventures, now that
she had, as it were, the control over them. 'It is so long'--she held
up a tress as she spoke. It was beautiful hair; soft, wavy even, and
the dye--unrenewed for days--had almost gone, leaving the coppery
sheen distinct.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302732">'She will never cut it off!' said Tara to herself as she went for
the razor. No woman would ever shave her head willingly. Why! when she
had had it done for the first time, she had screamed and fought. Her
mother-in-law had held her hands, and--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302733">She paused at the door as she re-entered, paralysed by what she
saw. Kate had found the knife Tara used for her limited cooking, and,
seated on the ground cheerfully, was already surrounded by rippling
hair which she had cut off by clubbing it in her hand and sawing away
as a groom does at a horse's tail.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302734">Tara's cry made her pause. The next moment the Rajpootni had
snatched the knife from her and flung it one way, the razor another,
and stood before her with blazing eyes and heaving breast.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302735">'It is foolishness!' she said fiercely. 'The <hi rend="italic">mems</hi> cannot be <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>. I
will not have it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302736">Kate stared at her. 'But I must--,' she began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302737">'There is no must at all,' interrupted Tara superbly; 'I will find
some other way.' And then she bent over quickly, and Kate felt her
hands upon her hair. 'There is plenty left,' she said with a sigh of
relief. 'I will plait it up so that no one will see the
difference.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302738">And she did. She put the gold bangle on again also, and by dawn the
next day Kate found herself once more installed its a screened woman;
but this time as a Hindu lady under a vow of silence and solitude in
the hopes of securing a son for her lord through the intercession of
old Anunda the Swâmi.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302739">'I have told Sri Anunda,' said Tara with a new respect in her
manner. 'I had to trust some one. And he is as God. He would not hurt
a fly.' She paused, then went on with a tone of satisfaction, 'But he
says the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> could not have become <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>, so that foolishness is well over.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302740" n="365 BITS, BRIDLES, AND SPURS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302741">'But what is to be done next, Tara?' asked Kate, looking in
astonishment round the wide old garden, arched over by tall forest
trees, and set round with high walls, in which she found herself. In
the faint dawn she could just see glimmering straight paths parcelling
it out into squares: and she could hear the faint tinkle of the water
runnels. 'I can't surely stop here.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302742">'The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will only have to keep still all
day in the darkest corner with her face to the wall,' said Tara. 'Sri
Anunda will do the rest. And when Soma returns he must take the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> away before the thirty regiments come and the
trouble begins.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302743">'Thirty regiments!' echoed Kate, startled.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302744">'He and others have gone out to see if it is true. They say so in
the Palace; but it is full of lies,' said Tara indifferently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302745">It was indeed. More than ever. But they began to need confirmation,
and so there was big talk of action, and jinglings of bits and bridles
and spurs in the city as well as in the camp. They were to intercept
the siege train from Firozpur, they were to get round to the rear of
the Ridge and overwhelmn it. They were to do everything save attack it
in face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302746">And, meanwhile, other people besides Soma and such-like Sadducean
sepoys had gone out to find the thirty regiments, and secret scouts
from the Palace were hunting about for some one to whom they might
deliver a letter addressed '<hi rend="italic">To the Officers,
Subadars, Chiefs, and others of the whole military force coming from
the Bombay Presidency.</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302747"><hi rend="italic">'To the effect that the statement of the defeat
of the Royal troops at Delhi is a false and lying fabrication
contrived by contemptible infidels the English. The true story is that
nearly eighty or ninety thousand organised Military Troops, and nearly
ten or fifteen thousand regular and other Cavalry, are now here in
Delhi. These troops are constantly engaged, night and day, in attacks
on the infidels, and have driven back their batteries from the
Ridge. In three or four days, please God, the whole Ridge will be
taken, when every one of the base unbelievers will be sent to
Hell. You are, therefore, on seeing this order, to use all endeavours
to reach the Royal Presence, so, joining the Faithful, give proofs of
zeal, and establish your renown. Consider this imperative.'</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302749">But though they hunted high and low, east, north, south, and west,
the Royal scouts found no one to receive the order.<pb xml:id="fswater_1302748" n="366 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> So it came back to Delhi, damp and pulpy;
for the rains had begun again, turning great tracts of country into
marsh and bog, and generally wetting the blankets in which the sepoys
kept guard sulkily.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0503" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III<lb/>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302751">They drenched Kate Erlton also, despite the arcaded trees above her
corner as she sate with her face to the wall in the wide old
garden. At first her heart beat at each step on the walk behind her,
but she soon realised that she was hidden by her vow, happed about
from the possibility of intrusion by her penance. But not many steps
came by her; they kept chiefly to the other end of the garden where
Sri Anunda was to be found. It was a curious experience. There was a
yard or two of thatch, screened by matting and supported by bamboos,
leaning not far off against the wall; and into this she crept at night
to find the indulgence of a dry blanket. At first she felt inclined to
seek its shelter when the rain poured loudly on the leaves above her
and fell thence in big blobs, making a noise like the little ripe figs
when the squirrels shook them down; but the remembrance that such
women as Tara performed like vows cheerfully kept her steady. And
after a day or two she often started to find it was already noon or
dusk, the day half-gone or done. Time slipped by with incredible
swiftness in watching the squirrels and the birds, in counting the
raindrops fall from a peepul leaf. And what a strange peace and
contentment the life brought! As she sate after dark in the thatch,
eating the rice and milk and fruit which Tara brought her stealthily,
she felt, at times, a terrified amaze at herself. If she ever came
through the long struggle for life, this surely would be the strangest
part of the dream. Tara, indeed, used to remark with a satisfied smile
that though the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> could not of course be <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>, still she did very well as a devoted and
repentant wife. Sri Anunda could never have had a better penitent. And
then, in reply to Kate's curious questions, she would say that Sri
Anunda was a <hi rend="italic">Swâmi</hi>. If the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> once saw and spoke to him she would know what
that meant.<pb xml:id="fswater_1302750" n="367 THE BEGINNING OF THE END"/> He had lived in
the garden for fifteen years. Not as a penance. A <hi rend="italic">Swâmi</hi> needed no penance as men and women
did; for he was not a man. Oh dear no! not a man at all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302752">So Hate, going on this hint of inhumanity, and guided by her
conventional ideas of Hindoo ascetics, imagined a monstrosity, and
felt rather glad than otherwise that Sri Anunda kept out of her
way.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302753">She was eager also to know how long she might have to stay in his
garden. The vow, Tara said, lasted for fifteen days. Till then no one
would question her right to sit and look at the wall; and by that time
Soma would have returned, and a plan for getting the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> away to the Ridge settled. For the master was
evidently not going to return to the city; perhaps he had forgotten
the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>? Kate smiled at this, drearily,
thinking that indeed he might; for he might be dead. But even this
uncertainty about all things, save that she sate and watched the
squirrels and the birds, had ceased to disturb her peace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302754">As a matter of fact, however, he was thinking of her more than
ever, and with a sense of proprietorship that was new to him. Here by
God's grace was the one woman for him to save; the somebody to kill,
should he fail, needing no selection. There were enough enemies and to
spare within the walls still, even though they had been melting away
of late. But a new one had come to the Ridge itself, which, though it
killed few, sapped steadily at the vigour of the garrison. This was
the autumnal fever, bad at Delhi in all years, and worse than usual in
this wet season; counterbalancing the benefit of the coolness and
sending half a regiment to hospital one day and letting them out of it
the next, sensibly less fit for arduous work. It claimed Jim Douglas,
already weakened by it, and made his wound slow of healing.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302755">'You haven't good luck certainly,' said Major Erlton, finding him
with chattering teeth taking quinine dismally. 'I don't know how it
is, but though I'm a lot thinner, this life seems to suit me. I
haven't felt so fit for ages.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302757">He had not been so fit, in truth. It was a healthier, simpler life
than he had led for many a long year; and ever since John Nicholson
had hidden him go back to his tent and sleep, even the haggardness had
left his face; the restlessness having been replaced by an eager
certainty of success. He was coming steadily to the front too, so the
Ridge said, since<pb xml:id="fswater_1302756" n="368 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Nicholson
had taken him up. And he had well deserved this, since there was not a
better soldier; cool, stubborn, certain to carry out orders. The very
man, in short, which men like the General wanted; and if he stayed to
the finish he would have a distinguished career before him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302758">But Herbert Erlton himself never thought of this; he hated thought
instinctively, and of late had even given up thinking of the city. He
never sate and watched the rose-red walls now. Perhaps because he was
too busy. So he left that to Jim Douglas, who had nothing else to do,
while he went about joyously preparing to accompany Nicholson in his
next lesson of law and order.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302759">For in the city it was becoming more and more difficult every day
to make the lies pass muster, even in the Palace; and, in despair, the
four Commanders-in-Chief had for once laid their heads together and
concocted a plan for intercepting that siege train from Firozpur. So
it was necessary that they should be taught the futility of such
attempts. Not that even the Palace people really believed them
possible. How could they? when almost every day, now, letters came to
the Ridge from some member or another of the Royal Family asking
effusively how he could serve the English cause. Only the old King,
revising his lists of precedence, listening still to brocaded bags,
taking cooling draughts, making couplets, being cozened by the Queen,
and breathed upon by Hussan Askuri, hovered between the policy of
being the great Moghul and a poor prisoner in the hands of fate. But
the delights of the former were too much for him as a rule, and he
would sit and finger the single gold coin which had come as a present
from Oude, as if he were to have the chance of minting millions with a
similar inscription.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302760">'<hi rend="italic">Bahâdur Shâh Ghâzee has
struck upon gold the coin of Victory.'</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302762">Even in its solitary grandeur it had, in truth, a surpassing
dignity of its own in the phrase--'struck upon gold the coin of
Victory.' So, gazing at it, he forgot that it was a mere sample, sent,
as the accompanying brocaded bag said, with a promise to pay more when
more victory brought more gold. But Zeenut Maihl, as she looked at it,
thought with a vague fury of certain gold within reach, hidden in her
house, and of what was to become of these coins with John Company's
mark on them? For she still lingered in the palace. Other women<pb xml:id="fswater_1302761" n="369 THE BEGINNING OF THE END"/> had fled, but she was wiser
than they. She knew that, come what might, her life was safe with the
English as victors; so there was nothing but the gold to think of. The
gold, and Jewun-Bukht, her son. The royal signet was in her possession
altogether now, and sometimes the orders, especially when they were
for payment of money, had to go without it, because '<hi rend="italic">the Queen of the World was asleep.</hi>' But she did not
dream. That was over; though in a way she clung fiercely to hope. So
Ghaus Khân with the Neemuch Brigade, and Bukht Khân with
the Bareilly Brigade, and Khair Sultân with the scrapings and
leavings of the regiments--who, owning no leader of their own, did
what was right in their own eyes--set out to intercept the big guns;
and Nicholson set out on the dawn of the 25th to intercept them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302763">The rain poured down in torrents, the guns sank to their axles in
mud, the infantry slipped and slithered, the cavalry were blinded by
the mire from the floundering horses. So from daybreak till sunset the
little force, two thousand in all--more than one half of whom were
natives--laboured eighteen miles through swamps. At noon, it is true,
they called a halt nine miles out at a village where the women
clustered on the housetops in wild alarm, remembering a day--months
back--when they had clustered round an unleavened cake, and the
head-man's wife had bidden them listen to the master's gun over the
far horizon.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302764">They were to listen to it again that day. For the enemy was ten
miles further over the marshes; and it was but noon. The force, no
doubt, had been afoot since four; but General Nicholson was
emphatically not an eight-hour man. So the shovings and slitherings of
guns and mortals began again cheerfully.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302766">Still it was nigh on sundown when, across a deep stream flowing
from the big marshes to the west, these contract-workers came on the
job they were eager to finish ere nightfall; six thousand rebels of
all arms holding three villages, a bastioned old <hi rend="italic">serai</hi>, and a town. It was a strong position in the
right angle formed by the stream and the flooded canal into which it
flowed. Water--impassable save by an unknown ford in the stream, by a
bridge held in force over the canal--on two sides of it. On the others
dismal swamps. A desperately strong position to attack at sundown
after eighteen miles slithering and shoving in the pouring rain;
especially with unknown odds against you. Not less, anyhow, than<pb xml:id="fswater_1302765" n="370 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> three to one. But John
Nicholson had a single eye; that is, an eye which sees one salient
point. Here, it was that bridge to the left, leading back to safe
shelter within the walls of Delhi. A cowardly foe must have no chance
of using that bridge during silent night watches. So, without a pause,
fifteen hundred of the two thousand waded breast-high across the
stream to attack the six thousand, Nicholson himself riding ahead for
a hasty reconnaissance; since the growing dusk left scant leisure for
anything save action. Yet once more a glance was sufficient; and, ere
the men, exposed to a heavy fire of grape in crossing the ford, were
ready to advance, the orders were given.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302767">There was a hint of cover in some rising ground before the old <hi rend="italic">serai</hi>--the strongest point of the defence. He would
utilise this, rush the position, change front, and sweep down on the
bridge. That must not remain as a chance for cowards an instant longer
than he could help; for Nicholson in everything he did seems never to
have contemplated defeat.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302768">So, flanked by the guns, supported by squadrons of the 9th Lancers
and the Guides cavalry, the three regiments<ref target="#fswatern370">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern370" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">61st, 1st Fusiliers, 2nd Punjabees.</note> marched
steadily towards the rising ground, following that colossal figure
riding, as ever, ahead. Till suddenly, as his charger's feet touched
the highest ground, Nicholson wheeled and held up his hand to those
below him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302769">'Lie down, men!' came his clear strong voice as he rode slowly
along the line; 'lie down and listen to what I've got to say. It's
only a few words.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302770">So, sheltered from the fire, they lay and listened. 'You of the
61st know what Sir Colin Campbell said to you at Chillianwallah. He
said the same thing to others at the Alma. I say it to you all
now. "<hi rend="italic">Hold your fire till within twenty or thirty
yards of that battery, and then, my boys! we will make short work of
it!</hi>"'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302771">Men cannot cheer lying on their stomachs, but the unmelodious
grunt--'We will, sir, by God, we will!'--was as good as one.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302773">Nicholson faced round on the semi again, and gave the order to the
artillery. So, in sharp thuds widening into a roar, the flanking guns
began work. Half a dozen rounds or so, and then the rider--motionless
as a statue in the centre<pb xml:id="fswater_1302772" n="371 THE BEGINNING OF THE END"/>--looked back quickly, waved his sword, and went on. The men
were up, after him, over the hillock, into the morass beyond,
silently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302774">'Steady, men! steady with it. On with you! Steady!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302775">They listened to the clear sonorous voice once more, though there
was no shelter now from the grape and canister, and musket balls; or
rather only the shelter of that one tall figure ahead riding at a
foot's-pace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302776">'Steady! Hold your fire! I'll give the word, never fear! Come on!
Come on!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302777">So through a perfect bog they stumbled on doggedly. Here and there
a man fell; but men will fall sometimes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302778">'Now then! Let then have it!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302779">They were within the limit. Twenty yards off lay the guns. There
was one furious volley; above it one word answered by a cheer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302780">So at the point of the bayonet the <hi rend="italic">serai</hi> was
carried. Then without a pause the troops changed front with a
swiftness unforeseen and swept on to the left.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302782">'To Delhi, brothers! To Delhi!' The old cry, begun at Meerut, rose
now with a new meaning as the panic-stricken guns limbered up and made
for the bridge. Too late! Captain Blunt's were after them, chasing
them. The wheel of the foremost, driven wildly, jammed; those
following could not pull up. So, helter skelter, they were in a
jumble, out of which Englishmen helped the whole thirteen! The day, or
rather the night, was won; for Nature's dark flag of truce hung even
between the assailants and the few desperate defenders of the third
village, who, with escape cut off, were selling their lives at a cost
to the attackers of seventeen out of that total death-roll of
twenty-five. But Nicholson knew his position sure, so he left night to
finish the rout, and, with his men, bivouacked without food or cover
among the marshes; for it was too dark to get the baggage over the
ford. Yet the troops were ready to start at daybreak for an eighteen
miles tramp back to the Ridge again. There was no talk of exhaustion
now, as at Budli-ke-serai; so just thirty-six hours after they
started, that is, just one hour for every mile of morass and none for
the fight, they startled the Ridge by marching in again and clamouring
for food! But Nicholson was in a towering temper. He had found that
another brigade had been lurking behind the canal, and that<pb xml:id="fswater_1302781" n="372 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> if he had had decent
information he might have smashed it, also, on his way home.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302783">'He hadn't even a guide that he didn't pick up himself,' commented
Major Erlton angrily. 'By George! how those niggers cave in to him!
And his political information was all rot. If the general had obeyed
instructions he would have been kicking his heels at Bahâdagurh
still.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302784">'We heard you at it about two o'clock,' said a new listener. 'I
suppose it was a night attack--risky business rather.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302785">Herbert Erlton burst into a laugh; but the elation on his face had
a pathetic tenderness in it. 'That was the bridge, I expect. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> blew it up before starting. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> sat on it till then. Besides there were the
wagons and tumbrils and things. <hi rend="italic">He</hi> told Tombs
to blow them up, too, for of course <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had to
bring the guns back, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> couldn't shove the
lot.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302786">As he passed on some of his listeners smiled.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302787">'It's a case of possession,' said one to his neighbour.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302788">'Pardon me,' said another, who had known the major for years. 'It
is a case of casting out. I wonder--' the speaker paused and shrugged
his shoulders.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302789">'Did you hear his name had gone up for the V.C.?' began his
companion.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302790">'Gone up! My dear fellow! It might have gone up fifty times
over. But it isn't his pluck that I wonder at; it is his
steadiness. He never shirks the little things. It is almost as if he
had found a conscience.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302791">Perhaps he had. He was cheerful enough to have had the testimony of
a good one, as, in passing, he looked in on Jim Douglas and met his
congratulations.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302792">'Bad shilling!' replied the major, beautifully unconscious. 'So
you've heard--and--hillo! what's up?' For Jim Douglas was busy getting
into disguise.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302793">'That old scoundrel Tiddu came in to camp with the news an hour
ago,' said the latter, whose face was by no means cheerful. 'He was
out carrying grain--saw the fugitives, and came in here, hoping for
<hi rend="italic">backsheesh</hi>, I believe. But--' Jim Douglas
looked round rapidly at the Major--'I'm awfully afraid, Erlton, that
he has not been in Delhi, to speak of, since I left. And I was relying
on him for news--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302794">'There isn't any--is there?' broke in Major Erlton with a queer
hush in his voice.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302795" n="373 THE BEGINNING OF THE END"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302796">'None. But there may be. So I'm off at once. I couldn't have a
better chance. The villain says the sepoys are slipping in on the sly
in hundreds; for the palace folk--or at least the king--thinks the
troops are still engaged, and is sending out reinforcements. So I
shall have no trouble in getting through the gates.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302797">Major Erlton radiant, splashed from head to foot, covered at once
with mud and glory, looked at the man opposite him with a curious
deliberation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302798">'I don't see why you should go at all,' he said slowly. 'I
wouldn't, if I--I mean I would rather you didn't.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302799">'Why?' The question came sharply.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302800">'Do you want the truth?' asked Herbert Erlton with a sudden
frown.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302801">'Certainly.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302802">'Then I'll tell it, Mr. Greyman--I mean Douglas--I--I'm grateful,
but--damn me, sir, if--if I want to be more so! I--I gave you my
chance once--like a fool; for I might have saved her--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302803">The hard handsome face was all broken up with passionate regret,
and the pity of it kept Jim Douglas silent for a moment; for he
understood it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302804">'You might,' he said at last. 'But I don't interfere with you
here. You can't save her--your wife, I mean--and if I fail you can
always--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302805">'There is no need to tell me what to do then,' interrupted Major
Erlton grimly. 'I'll do it without your help.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302806">He turned on his heel, then paused. 'It isn't that I'm ungrateful,'
he repeated, almost with an appeal in his voice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302807">'And I don't mean to be offensive; only you and I can't--' His own
mental position seemed beyond him, and he stood for a moment
irresolute. Then he held out his hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302808">'Well! good-bye. I suppose you mean to stick to it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302809">'I mean to stick to it. Good-bye.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302810">'And I must be off to my bed. Haven't slept a wink for two nights,
and I shall be on duty to-morrow. Well! I believe I've as good a
chance of seeing Kate here as you have of finding her there; but I
can't prevent your going, of course.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302812">So he went off to his bed, and Jim Douglas, following Tiddu, who
was waiting for him in the Koodsia Gardens, carried out his intention
of sticking to it; while John Nicholson in his tent, forgetful of his
advice to both of them,<pb xml:id="fswater_1302811" n="374 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> was
jotting down notes for his despatch. One of them was. '<hi rend="italic">The enemy was driven from the serai with scarcely any
loss to us, and made little resistance as we advanced.</hi>' The other
was '<hi rend="italic">Query? how many men in buckram? Most say seven
or eight thoaasand. I think between three and four.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302813">He had, indeed, a vile habit of telling the truth, even in
despatches. So ended the day of Nujjufghur.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302814">The next morning, the 27th, broke fine and clear. Kate Erlton
waking with the birds found the sky full of light already, clear as a
pale topaz beyond the over-arching trees.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302815">She stood after leaving her thatch, looking into the garden, lost
in a sort of still content. It seemed impossible she should be in the
heart of a big city. There was no sound but the faint rustling of the
wet leaves drying themselves in the soft breeze, and the twitterings
of squirrels and birds. There was nothing to be seen but the trees,
and the broad paths rising, above the flooding water from the
canal-cut which ran at the farther side.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302816">And Sri Anunda had lived here for fifteen years; while she? How
long had she been there? She smiled to herself, for, in truth, she had
lost count of days altogether, almost of Time itself. She was losing
hold of life. She told herself this, with that vague amaze at finding
it so. Yes! she was losing her grip on this world without gaining,
without even desiring, a hold on the next. She was learning a strange
new fellowship with the dream of which she was a part, because it
would soon be past; because the trees, the flowers, the birds, the
beasts, were mortal as herself. A squirrel, its tail a-fluff, was
coming down the trunk of the next tree in fitful half-defiant jerks,
its bright eyes watching her. The corner of her veil was full of the
leavings of her simple morning meal which she always took with her to
scatter under the trees; and now, in sudden impulse, she sank down to
her knees and held a morsel of plantain out temptingly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302818">Dear little mortal, she thought, with a new tenderness, watching it
as it paused uncertain; until the consciousness that she was being
watched in her turn made her look up; then pause, as she was,
astonished, yet not alarmed, at the figure before her. It was neither
tall nor short, dark nor fair, and it was wrapped from knee to
shoulder in a dazzling white cloth draped like a Greek chiton, which
showed the thin yet not emaciated curves of the limbs, and left the
poise<pb xml:id="fswater_1302817" n="375 THE BEGINNINNG OF THE END"/> of the long throat
bare. The head was clean-shaven, smooth as the cheek, and the face,
destitute even of eyebrows, was softly seamed with hues and wrinkles
which seemed to leave it younger, and brighter, as if in an eternity
of smile-provoking content. But the eyes! Kate felt a strange shock,
as they brought back to her the innocent dignity Raphael gave to his
San-Sistine Bambino; for this was Sri Anunda--it could be no one
else. In his hand he held a bunch of henna-blossom, the camphire of
Scripture, the cypress of the Greeks; yellowish green, insignificant,
incomparably sweet. He held it out to her, smiling, then laid it on
her outstretched hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302819">'The lesson is learnt, sister,' he said softly. 'Go in peace, and
have no fear.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302820">The voice, musical exceedingly, thrilled her through and
through. She knelt looking after him regretfully as, without a pause,
he passed on his way. So that was a <hi rend="italic">Swâmi</hi>! She went back to her corner--for
already early visitors were drifting in for Sri Anunda's blessing--and
with the bunch of henna-blossom on the ground before her sat
thinking.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302821">What an extraordinary face it was. So young, so old. So wise, so
strangely innocent. Tara was right. It was not a man's face. Yet it
could not be called angelic, for it was the face of a mortal. Yes!
that was it, a mortal face immortal through its mortality--through the
circling wheel of life and death. The strong perfume of the flowers
reaching her, set her a-thinking of them. Did he always give a bunch
when the penance was over and say the lesson was learnt? It was a
significant choice, these flowers of life and death. For bridal hands
had been stained with henna, and corpses embalmed with it for ages,
and ages, and ages. Or was that 'peace go with you,' that 'have no
fear' meant as an encouragement in something new? Had they been making
plans? had anything happened? She scarcely seemed to care. So, as the
cloudless day passed on, she sat looking at the henna-blossom and
thinking of Sri Anunda's face.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302822">But something <hi rend="italic">had</hi> happened. Jim Douglas had
come back to the city and Tara knew it. She had barely escaped his
seeing her, and she felt she could not escape it long. And then, it
seemed to her, the old life would begin again; for she would never be
able to keep the truth from him. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> might
talk of deceit glibly; but if it came to telling lies to the waster
she would fail.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302823" n="376 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302824">There was only one chance. If she could get the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> safely out of the city at once; then she could
tell the truth without fear. The necessity for immediate action came
upon her by surprise. She had ceased to expect the master's return,
she had not cared personally for Kate's safety, and so had been
content to let the future take care of itself. But now everything was
changed. If Kate were not got rid of, sent out of the city, one of two
things must happen. The master must be left to get her out as best he
could, at the risk of his life; or she, Tara, must return to the old
allegiance; return and sit by, while the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> in
a language she did not understand, told the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> how she had been willing to be <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> for him!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302825">So while Kate sat looking at the henna-blossom, Tara sat telling
herself that at all costs, all risks, she must be got out of the city
that night. She, and her jewels. They were at present tied up in a
bundle in Tara's room, but the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi> might
think her a thief if the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> went without
them. And another thing she decided. She would not tell the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> the reason of this sudden action. True, Kate
had professed herself determined that the master should not risk his
life for her again: but women were not--not always--to be
trusted. Four the rest, Soma must help.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302826">She waited till dusk, however, before appealing to him, knowing
that her only chance lay in taking him by storm, in leaving him no
time for reflection. So, just as the lights were beginning to twinkle
in the bazaars, she made her way, full of purpose, to the half-ruined
sort of cell in the thickness of the wall not far from the sally-port,
in which of late--since he had taken morosely to drugs,--he was
generally to be found at this time, walking drowsily to his evening
meal before going out.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302827">She found him thus, sure enough, and began at once on her task. He
must help. He could easily pass out the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>. That was all she asked of him. But his
handsome face settled into sheer obstinacy at once. He was not going
to help any one, he said, or harm any one, till they struck the first
blow, and then they had better defend themselves. That was the
end. And so it seemed; for after ten minutes of entreaty, he stood up
with something of a lurch ere he found his feet, and bid her go. She
only wasted her time and his, since he must eat his food ere he went
to relieve the sentry at the sally-port.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302828" n="377 THE BEGINNING OF THE END"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302829">She caught him up reproachfully, almost indignantly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302830">'Then thou art there, on guard! and it needs but the opening of a
door, a thrusting of a woman out--to--<hi rend="italic">die</hi>,
perchance, Soma. Remember that!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302831">She spoke with a feverish eagerness, as if the suggestion had its
weight with her, but he treated it contemptuously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302832">'<hi rend="italic">Loh!</hi>' he said in scorn. 'What a woman's
word! Thank the Gods I was not born one.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302833">The taunt bit deep, and Tara drew herself up angrily. So the
brother and sister stood face to face, strangely alike.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302834">'Was't not?' she retorted bitterly . 'The Gods know. Is there not
woman in man, and man in woman, among those born at a birth? Soma! for
the sake of that--do this for me--' It was her last appeal; she had
kept it for the last, and now her sombre eyes were ablaze with
passionate entreaty. 'See, brother! I claim it of you as a right. Thou
didst take my sainthood from me once. Count this as giving it back
again.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302835">'Back again?' echoed Soma thickly. What fool's talk is this?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302836">'Let it be fool's talk, brother,' she interrupted, with a strange
intensity in her voice. 'I care not--thou dost not know; I cannot tell
thee. But--but <hi rend="italic">this</hi> will be counted to thee in
restitution. Soma! think of it as my sainthood! Sure thou dost owe me
it! Soma! for the sake of the hand which lay in thine.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302837">In her excitement she moved a step forward, and he shrank back
instinctively. True, she was a saint in another way if those scars
were true; but--at the moment, being angry with her, he chose to
doubt, to remember--'Stand back!' he cried roughly, unsteadily. 'What
do I owe thee? What claim hast thou?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302838">The question, the gesture outraged her utterly. The memory of a
whole life of vain struggling after self-respect surged to her brain,
bringing that almost insane light to her eyes. 'What?' she echoed
fiercely--'this!' Ere he could prevent it, her hand was in his,
gripping it like a vice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302839">'So in the beginning--so in the end!' she gasped, as he struggled
with her madly. 'Tara and Soma hand in hand. Nay! I am strong as
thou.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302841">She spoke truth, for his nerve and muscle were slack with opium;
yet he fought wildly, striking at her with his left hand, until in a
supreme effort she lost her footing, they<pb xml:id="fswater_1302840" n="378 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> both staggered, and he--as she loosed her hold--fell
backwards, striking his head against a projecting brick in the ruined
wall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302842">'Soma!' she whispered to his prostrate figure, 'art hurt, brother?
Speak to me!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302843">But he lay still, and, with a cry, she flung herself on her knees
beside him, feeling his heart, listening to his breathing, searching
for the injury. It was a big cut on the crown of the head; but it did
not seem a bad one, and she began to take his unconsciousness more
calmly. She had seen folk like that before from a sudden fall, and
they came to themselves, none the worse, after a while; but it would
be scarcely in time for him to relieve guard....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302844">She stood up suddenly and looked round her. Soma's uniform hung on
a peg, his musket stood in a corner.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302845">Half-an-hour after this, Kate, waiting in the thatch for Tara to
cone as usual, gave a cry, more of surprise than alarm, as a tall
figure, in uniform, stepped into the flickering light of the
cresset.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302846">'Soma!' she cried, 'what is it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302847">A gratified smile came to the curled mustachios. 'Soma or Tara, it
matters not,' replied a familiar voice. 'They were one in the
beginning. Quick, <hi rend="italic">mem-sahib</hi>. On with the
jewels. I have a dark veil too for the gate.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302848">Kate stood up, her heart throbbing. 'Am I to go, then? Is that what
Sri Anunda meant?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302849">'Sri Anunda! hath he been here?' Tara paused, sniffed, and once
more those dark eyes met the light ones with a fierce jealousy. 'he
hath given thee henna-blossom. I smell it; and he gives it to none but
those who--So the Swâmi's lesson is learnt--and the disciple
can go in peace!' She broke off with a petulant laugh. 'Well! so be
it. It ends my part. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> will sleep among
her own to-night; Sri Anunda hath said it. Come--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302850">'But how? I must know how,' protested Kate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302851">The laugh rose again. 'Wherefore? The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> is
Sri Anuuda's disciple. For the rest, I will let the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> out through the little river-gate. There is a
boat, and she can go in peace.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302853">There was something so wild, so almost menacing in Tara's face,
that Kate felt her only hope was to obey. And, in good sooth, the
scent of the henna-blossom she carried with<pb xml:id="fswater_1302852" n="379 THE BEGINNING OF THE END"/> her, tucked into her bossom, gave her,
somehow, an irrational hope that all would go well as she followed her
guide swiftly through the alleys and bazaars.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302854">'The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> must wait here,' whispered Tara at
last, pausing behind one of the ungainly mausoleums in what had been
the old Christian cemetery. 'When she hears me singing Sonny<hi rend="italic">baba's</hi> song, she must follow to the Water-gate. It
is behind the ruins, there.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302855">Kate crouched down, setting her back, native fashion, against the
tomb. And as she waited she wondered idly what mortal lay there; so,
being strangely calm, she let her fingers stray to the recess she felt
behind her. There should be a marble tablet there; and even in the
dark she might trace the lettering. But the recess was empty, the
marble having evidently been picked out. So it was a nameless
grave. And the next? She moved over to it stealthily, then to the
next. But the tablets had been taken out of all and carried off--for
curry-stones most likely. So the graves were nameless; those beneath
them mortals--nothing more. As she waited under the stars, her mind
reverted to Sri Anunda and the Wheel of Life and Death. The
immortality of mortality! Was that the lesson which was to let her go
in peace?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302856">She started from the thought as that native version of the 'Happy
Land' came, nasally, from behind the ruins. As she passed them, a
group of men were squatted gossiping round a hookah, and more than one
figure passed her. But a woman with her veil drawn, and a clank of
anklets on her feet, did not even invite a curious eye; for it was
still early enough for such folk to be going home.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302858">Then, as she passed down a flight of steps, a hand stole out from a
niche and drew her back into a dark shadow. The next minute, with a
low whisper, 'There is no fear! Sri Anunda hath said it. Go in peace!'
she felt herself thrust through a door into darkness. But a feeble
glimmer showed below her, and creeping down another flight of steps,
she found herself outside Delhi, looking over the strip of low-lying
land where in the winter the buffaloes had grazed beneath Alice
Gissing's house, but which was now flooded into a still backwater by
the rising of the river. And out of it the stunted <hi rend="italic">kikar</hi> and tamarisks grew strangely, their feathery
branches arching over it. But to the left, beyond<pb xml:id="fswater_1302857" n="380 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> the water bastion, rose a mass of darker
foliage--the Koodsia Gardens. Once there she would be beyond floods,
and Tara had said there was a boat. Kate found it, moored a little
further towards the river--a flat-bottomed punt, with a pole. It
proved easier to manage than she had expected; for the water was
shallow, and the trunks and branches of the trees helped her to get
along, so that after a time she decided on keeping to that method of
progress as long as she could. It enabled her to skirt the river bank,
where there were fewer lights telling of watch-fires. Besides, she
knew the path by the river leading to Metcalfe House. It might be
under water now; but if she crept into the park at the ravine--if she
could take the boat so far--she might manage to reach Metcalfe
House. There was an English picquet there, she knew. So, as she mapped
out her best way, a sudden recollection came to her of the last time
she had seen that river path, when her husband and Alice Gissing were
walking down it, and Captain Morecombe--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302859">Ah! was it credible? Was it not all a dream? Could this be
real--could it be the same world?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302860">She asked herself the question with a dull indifference as she
struggled on doggedly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302861">But not more than two hours afterwards the conviction that the
world had not changed came upon her with a strange pang as she stood
once more on the terrace of Metcalfe House with English faces around
her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302862">'By Heaven, it's Mrs. Erlton!' she heard a familiar voice say. It
seemed to her hundreds of miles away in some far, far country to which
she had been journeying for years. 'Here! let me get hold of her--and
fetch some water--wine--anything. How--how was it, sergeant?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302863">'In a boat, sir, coming hand over hand down at the stables. She
sang out quite calmly she was an Englishwoman, and--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302864">'Then--then they touched their caps to me,' said Kate, making an
effort, 'and so I knew that I was safe. It was so strange; it--it
rather upset me. But I am all right now, Captain Morecombe.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302865">'We had better send up for Erlton,' said another officer aside; but
Kate caught the whisper--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302866">'Please not. I can walk up to cantonments quite well And--I would
rather have no fuss--I--I couldn't stand it.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302867" n="381 AT LAST"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302868">She had stood enough and to spare, agreed the little knot of men
with a thrill at their hearts as they watched her set off in the
moonlight with Captain Morecombe and an orderly. They were to go
straight to the Major's tent; and if he was still at mess--which was
more than likely, since it was only half-past nine--Captain Morecombe
was to leave her there and go on with the news. There would be no
fuss, of that she might be sure, said the latter, forbearing even to
speak to her on the way, save to ask her if she felt all right.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302869">'I feel as if I had just been born,' she said slowly. In truth, she
was wondering if that spinning of the Great Wheel towards Life again
brought with it this forlornness, this familiarity.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0504" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV<lb/>AT LAST</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302871">No fuss indeed! Kate, as she sat in her husband's little tent
waiting for him to come to her, felt that so far she might have
arrived from a very ordinary journey. The bearer, it is true, who had
been the Major's valet for years, had salaamed more profoundly than
usual, had even put up a pious prayer, and expressed himself pleased;
but he had immediately gone off to fetch hot water, and returning with
it and clean towels, had suggested mildly that the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> might like to wash her face and hands. Kate,
with a faint smile, felt there was no reason why she should not. She
need not look worse than necessary. But she paused almost with a gasp
at the familiar half-forgotten luxuries. Scented soap! a sponge--and
there on the camp table was a looking-glass! She glanced down with a
start at the little round one in the ring she wore; then went over to
the other with its toilet cover, brushes, and combs, her husband's
razors, gold studs in a box; and there was her own photograph in a
frame, a Bible, and a prayer book--the latter things bringing her no
surprise, no emotion of any kind. For they had always been fixtures on
Major Erlton's dressing-table, mute evidences to no sentiment on his
part, but simply to the bearer's knowledge of the proprieties and the
ways of real <hi rend="italic">sahibs</hi>. But other things she saw
made her heart grow soft. The little camp<pb xml:id="fswater_1302870" n="382 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> bed, the simplicity and hardness of everything in
comparison with what her husband had been wont to demand of life; for
he had always been a real prince, feeling the rose-leaf beneath the
feather bed, and never stinting himself in comfort. Then the swords,
and belts, and heaven knows what panoply of war--not spick-and-span
decorations as they used to be in the old days, but worn and
used--gave her a pang. Well! he had always been a good soldier, they
said.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302872">And then, interrupting her thoughts, the old <hi rend="italic">khansâman</hi> had come in, having taken time to
array himself gorgeously in livery. The Father of the fatherless and
orphan, lie said, whimperingly, alluding to the fact that he had lost
both parents--which, considering he was past sixty, was only to be
expected--had heard his prayer. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was
spared to Freddy-<hi rend="italic">baba</hi>. And would she please to
order dinner. As the Major-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> dined at mess,
her slave was unprepared with a roast. Fish also would partake of
tyranny; but he could open a tin of Europe-soup, and with a chicken
cutlet--Kate cut him short with a request for tea; by-and-by,
when--when the Major-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi> should have
come. And when she was alone again, she shivered and rested her head
on her crossed arms upon the table beside which she sat, with a sort
of sob. This--Yes!--this of all she had cone through was the hardest
to bear. This surge of pity, of tenderness, of unavailing regret for
the past, the present, the future. What?--What could she say to him,
or he to her, that would make remembrance easier, anticipation
happier?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302873">Hark! there was his step!--his voice saying good-night to Captain
Morecombe.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302874">'I hope she will he none the worse,' came the reply. 'Good-night,
Erlton--I'm--I'm awfully glad, old fellow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302875">'Thanks!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302876">She stood up with a sickening throb at her heart. Oh! she was glad
too! So glad to see him, and tell him--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302877">How tall he was, she thought with a swift recognition of his good
looks, as he came in, stooping to pass under the low entrance. Very
tall, and thin. Much thinner, and--and--different somehow--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302879">'Kate!' He paused half a second, looking at her curiously--'Kate!
I'm--I'm--awfully glad.' He was beside her now, his big hands holding
hers; but she felt that she was further away from him than she had
been in that brief<pb xml:id="fswater_1302878" n="383 AT LAST"/> pause when she had half
expected, half wished him to take her in his arms and kiss her as if
nothing had happened, as if life were to begin again. It would have
been so much easier; they might have forgotten then, both of them. but
now, what came, must come without that chrism of impulse; must come in
remembrance and regret. <hi rend="italic">Awfully glad!</hi> That was what Captain Morecombe
had said. Was there no more between them than that? No more between
her and this man, who was the father of her child. The sting of the
thought made her draw him closer, and with a sob rest her head on his
shoulder. Then he stooped and kissed her. 'I--I didn't know. I wasn't
sure if you'd like it,' he said, but I'm awfully glad, old girl, upon
my life I am. You must have had a terrible time.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302880">She looked up with a hopeless pain in her eyes. He was gone from
her again; gone utterly. 'It was not so bad as you might think,' she
answered, trying to smile. 'Mr. Greyman did so much--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302881">'Greyman! You mean Douglas, I suppose?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302882">She stared for a second. 'Douglas? I don't know. I mean--' Then she
paused. How could she say, 'The man you rode against at Lucknow,' when
she wanted to forget all that; forget everything! And then a sudden
fear made her add hastily, 'He is here, surely--he came long ago.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302883">Major Erlton nodded. 'I know; but his real name is Douglas; at
least he says so. Do you mean to say you haven't seen him? That he
didn't help you to get out?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302884">'You mean that--that he has gone back?' asked Kate faintly. Her
husband gave a low whistle. 'What a queer start; a sort of Box and
Cox. He went back to find you yesterday.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302885">Kate's hand went up to her forehead almost wildly. Then Tara must
have known. but why had she not mentioned it? Still, in a way, it was
best as it was; since once he heard she, Kate, had gone, he would
return. For Tara would tell him, of course.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302886">These thoughts claimed her for the moment, and when she looked up,
she found her husband watching her curiously.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302887">'He must have done an awful lot for you, of course,' he said
shortly; but I'd rather it had been any one else, and that's a
fact. However, it can't be helped. Hullo! here's the <hi rend="italic">khansâman</hi> with some tea--thoughtful of the
old scoundrel, isn't it?'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302888" n="384 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302889">'I--I ordered it,' put in Kate, feeling glad of the
diversion. Major Erlton laughed kindly. 'What, begun already! The old
sinner's had a precious easy tine of it; but now--' he pulled himself
up awkwardly, and, as if to cover his hesitation, walked over to a
box, and after rummaging in it, brought out a packet of
letters. 'Freddy's,' he said cheerfully. 'He's all right. Jolly as a
sandboy. I kept them--in--in case--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302890">A great gratitude made the past dim for a moment. He seemed nearer
to her again. 'I can't look at them to-night, Herbert,' she said
softly, laying her hand beside his upon them. 'I'm--I'm too
tired.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302891">No wonder. You must have your tea and go to bed,' he replied. Then
he looked round the tent. 'It isn't a bad little place, you'll
find--I'm on duty to-night--so--so you'll manage, I daresay.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302892">'On duty,' she echoed, pouring herself out a cup of tea rather
hastily. 'Where?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302893">'Oh! at the front. There is never anything worth going for now. We
are both waiting for the assault; that's the fact. But I shan't be
back till dawn, so--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302894">He was standing looking at her, tall, handsome, full of vitality;
and suddenly he lifted a fold of her tinsel-set veil and smiled.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302895">'Jolly dress that for a fancy ball, and what a jolly scent it's
got. It is that flower, isn't it? You look awfully well in it, Kate!
In fact, you look wonderfully fit all round.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302896">'So do you!' she said hurriedly, her hand going up to the henna
blossom. There was a sudden quiver in her voice, a sudden fierce pain
in her heart. 'You--you look--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302897">'Oh! I,' he replied carelessly still with admiring eyes, 'I'm as
fit as a fiddle. I say! where did you get all those jewels? What a lot
you have! They're awfully becoming.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302898">'They are Mr. Greyman's,' she said; they belonged to his--to--'
then she paused. But the contemptuously-comprehending smile on her
husband's face made her add quietly, 'to a woman--<hi rend="italic">a
woman he loved very dearly,</hi> Herbert.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302899">There was a moment or two of silence, and then Major Erlton went to
the entrance, raised the curtain, and looked out. A flood of moonlight
streamed into the tent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302901">'It's about time I was off,' he said after a bit, and there<pb xml:id="fswater_1302900" n="385 AT LAST"/> was a queer constraint in his voice. Then he
came over and stood by Kate again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302902">'It isn't any use talking over--over things to-night, Kate,' he
said quietly. 'There's a lot to think of and I haven't thought of it
at all. I never knew you see--if this would happen. But I dare say you
have; you were always good at thinking. So--so you had better do it
for both of us. I don't care, <hi rend="italic">now</hi>. It will be
what you wish, of course.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302903">'We will talk it over to-morrow,' she said in a low voice. She
would not look in his face. She knew she would find it soft with the
memory held in that one word,--<hi rend="italic">now</hi>. Ah! how
much easier it would have been if she had never come back! And yet she
shrank from the same thought on his lips.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302904">'There was always the chance of my getting potted,' he said almost
apologetically. 'But I'm not. So--well! let's leave it for
to-morrow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302905">'Yes,' she replied steadily, 'for tomorrow.' He gathered some of
his things together, and then held out his hand. 'Good-night, Kate. I
wouldn't lie awake thinking, if I were you. What's the good of it? We
will just have to make the best of it for the boy. But I'd like you to
know two things--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302906">'Yes--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302907">'That I couldn't forget, of course: and that--' he paused. 'Well!
that doesn't matter. It's only about myself--and it doesn't mean much
after all. So good-night.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302908">As she moved to the door also--forced into following him by the
ache in her heart, for him more than for herself--the jingle of her
anklets made him turn--with an easy laugh.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302909">'It does't sound respectable,' he said: then, with a sudden
compunction, he added, 'But the dress is much prettier than those
dancing girls, and--by Heaven, Kate: you're always been miles too good
for me; and that's the fact. Well! let us leave it for to-morrow.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302911">Yes! For to-morrow she told herself, with a determination not to
think as, dressed as she was, she nestled down into the strange
softness of the camp bed, too weary of the pain and pity of this
coming back even for tears. Yet she thought of one thing; not that she
was safe, not that she would see the boy again--only of the thing he
had been going to tell her about himself. What was it? She wanted to
know; she wanted to know all--everything. 'Herbert!'<pb xml:id="fswater_1302910" n="386 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> she whispered to the pillow, 'I wish you had
told me--I want to know--I want to make it easier--for--for us
all.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302912">And so, not even grateful for her escape, she fell asleep
dreamlessly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302913">It was dawn when she woke with the sound of some one talking
outside. He had come back. No! that was not his voice. She sat up,
listening.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302914">'The servants say she is asleep. Some one had better go in and wake
her. The doctor--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302915">'He's behind with the <hi rend="italic">dhooli</hi>. Ah! there's
Morecombe; he knows her.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302916">But there was no need to call her. Kate was already at the door,
her eyes wide with the certainty of evil. There was no need even to
tell her what had happened: for in the first rays of the rising sun,
seen almost star-like behind a dip in the rocky ridge, she saw a
little procession making for the tent.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302917">'He--he is dead,' she said quietly. There was hardly a question in
her tone. She knew it must be so. Had he not begged her to leave it
till to-morrow? and this was to-morrow. Were not her eyes full of its
rising sun, and what its beams held in their bright clasp?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302918">'It seems impossible,' said some one in a low voice, breaking in on
the pitiful silence. 'He always seemed to have a charmed life, and
then, in an instant--when nothing was going on--this chance
bullet.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302919">It did not seem impossible to her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302920">'Please don't make a fuss about me, doctor,' she pleaded in a tone
which went to his heart when he proposed the coilventional
solaces. 'Remember I have been through so--so much already. I can bear
it. I can, indeed, if I'm left alone with him--while it is
possible. Yes! I know there is another lady, but I only want to be
alone, with him.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302922">So they left her there beside the little camp-bed with its new
burden. There was no sign of strife upon him. Only that blue mark
behind his ear among his hair. And his face showed no pain. Kate
covered it with a little fine handkerchief she found folded away in a
scented case she had made for him before they were married. It had
Alice Gissing's monogram oil it. It was better so, she told herself;
he would have liked it. She had no flowers except the faded
henna-blossom, but it smelt sweet as she tucked it under the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302921" n="387 AT LAST"/> hand which she had left half-clasped upon his
sword. She might at least tell him so, she thought half bitterly, that
the lesson was learnt, that he might go in peace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302923">Then she sat down at the table and looked over their boy's letters
mechanically; for there was nothing to think of now. The morrow had
settled the problem. Captain Morecombe came in once or twice to say a
word or two, or bring in other men, who saluted briefly to her as they
passed to stand beside the dead man for a second, and then go out
again. She was glad they cared to come; had begged that any might come
who chose, as if she were not there. But at one visitor she looked
curiously, for he came in alone. A tall man--as tall as Herbert, she
thought--with a dark beard and keen kindly eyes. She saw them, for he
turned to her with the air of one who has a right to speak, and she
stood up involuntarily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302924">'His name was up for the Victoria Cross, madam,' said a clear
resonant voice, 'as you may know; but that is nothing. He was a fine
soldier--a soldier such as I--I am John Nicholson, madam--can ill
spare. For the rest--he leaves a good name to his son.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302925">The sunlight streamed in for ann instant on to the little bed and
its burden as he passed out, and glittered on the sword and
tassels. Kate knelt down beside it and kissed the dead hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302926">'That was what you meant, wasn't it, Herbert?' she whispered. 'I
wish you had told it me yourself, dear.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302927">She wished it often. Thinking over it all in the long days that
followed, it came to be almost her only regret. If he had told her, if
he had heard her say how glad she was, she felt that she would have
asked no more. And so, as she went down every evening to lay the white
rose-buds the gardener brought her upon his grave, she used to
repeat--as if he could hear them--his own words. 'It is the finish
that is the win or the lose of a race.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302928">That is what many a man was saying to himself upon the Ridge in the
first week of September. For the siege train had come at last. The
winning post lay close ahead, and they must ride all they knew. But
those in command said it anxiously; for day by day the hospitals
became more crowded, and cholera, re-appearing, helped to swell the
rear-guard of graves, when the time had come for vanguards
only.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302929" n="388 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302930">Some men, however--amongst them Baird Smith and John
Nicholson--took no heed of sickness or death. And these two,
especially, looked into each other's eyes and said, 'When you are
ready I'm ready.' Their seniors might say that an assault would be
thrown on the hazard of a die. What of that--if men are prepared to
throw sixes, as these two were? They had to be thrown, if India was to
be kept; if this bubble of sovereignty was to be pricked, the gas let
out.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302931">In the city and the palace, also, men, feeling the struggle close,
put hand and foot to whip and spur. But there was no one within the
walls who had the seeing single eye, quick to seize the salient point
of a position. Baird Smith saw it fast enough. Saw the thickets and
walls of the Koodsia Gardens in front of him, the river guarding his
left, a sinuous ravine--cleaving the hillside into cover--creeping
down from the ridge on his right to within two hundred yards of the
city wall; and that bit of the wall, between the Moree gate and the
Water Bastion, was its weakest portion--the curtain walls long, mere
parapets, only wide enough for defence by muskets. So said the spies,
though it seemed almost incredible to English engineers that the
defence had not been strengthened by pulling down the adjacent houses
and building a rampart for guns.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302933">In truth there was no one to suggest it, and if it had been
suggested there was no one to carry it out, for even now, at the last,
the palace seethed with dissension and intrigue. Yet still the sham
went on unconceivably. Jim Douglas, indeed, walking through the
bazaars in his Afghan dress, very nearly met his fate through it. For
he was seized incontinently and made to figure as one of the retinue
of the Amir of Kabul's ambassador, who, about the beginning of
September, was introduced to the private Hall of Audience as a
sedative to doubtful dreamers, and a tonic to brocaded bags. Luckily
for him, however, the men called upon to play the other part in the
farce--chiefly cloth-merchants from Peshawur and elsewhere, whom Jim
Douglas had dodged successfully so far--had been in such abject fear
of being discovered themselves that they had no thought of discovering
others. For Bahâdur Shâh had the dust and ashes of a
Moghul in him still. Jim Douglas recognised the fact in the very
obstinacy of delusion in the wax-like haggard old face looking with
glazed, tremulous-lidded eyes at the mock<pb xml:id="fswater_1302932" n="389 AT LAST"/>
mission; and in the faded voice accepting his vassal of Kabul's
promise of help. It was an almost incredible scene, Jim Douglas
thought; and given it, there was no limit to possibilities in this
phantasmagoria of kingship. The white shadows of the marble arches
with their tale of boundless power and wealth in the past, the wide
plains beyond, the embroidered curtain of the sun-lit garden, the
curves of courtiers, most of them in the secret, no doubt; and below
the throne these tag-rag and hob-tail of the bazaars--one of them at
least a hell-doomed infidel--figuring away in borrowed finery--all
this was as unreal as a magic lantern picture, and like it, was
followed haphazard, without rhyme or reason, by the next on the slide;
for, as he passed out of the presence, he heard the question of
appointing a Governor to Bombay brought up and discussed gravely--that
Province being reported to have sent in its allegiance <hi rend="italic">en bloc</hi> to the Great Moghul.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302934">The slides, however, were not always so dignified, so decorous. One
came, a day or two afterwards, showing a miserable old pantaloon
driven to despair because six hundred hundred sepoys would not behave
according to strict etiquette, but, invading his privacy with threats,
reduced him to taking his beautiful new cushion from the Peacock
Throne and casting it among them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302935">'Take it,' he cried passionately, 'it is all I have left. Take it,
and let me go in peace!' But the lesson he had to learn was not learnt
by him as yet, so he had to remain; for once more the sepoys sent out
word that there was to be no skulking. To do the Royal Family justice,
however, they seem by this time to have given up the idea of
flight. Even Abool-Bukr, forsaking drunkenness as well as that kind
detaining hand, clung to his kinsfolk bravely, behaving in all ways as
a newly-married young prince should, who looked towards filling the
throne itself at some future time.<ref target="#fswatern389">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern389" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">His widow died last
year, having spent thirty-eight years of her fifty-four in cherishing
the memory of a saint upon earth.</note></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302937">The sepoys themselves had given up blustering, and many, like Soma,
had taken to <hi rend="italic">bhang</hi> instead; drugging themselves
deliberately into indifference. The latter had recovered from the blow
on the back of his head, which, however, as is so often the case, had
for the time at any rate deprived him of<pb xml:id="fswater_1302936" n="390 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> all recollection of the events immediately preceding
it. So, as Tara had restored his uniform before he was able to miss
it, he treated her as if nothing had occurred--greatly to her
relief.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302938">The fact had its disadvantages, however, by depriving her of all
corroborative evidence of the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> having really
left the city. Thus Jim Douglas, warned by past experience, and made
doubtful by Tara's strange reticences, refused to believe it. Her
whole story, indeed, marred as it was by endless reserves and
exaggerations, seemed incredible; the more so because Tiddu--who lied
wildly as to his constant sojourn in Delhi--professed utter disbelief
in it. So, after a few days unavailing attempt to get at the truth,
Jim Douglas sent the old man off with a letter of inquiry to the
Ridge, and waited for the answer.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302939">Waited, like all Delhi, under the shadow of the lifted sword which
hung above the city. A sword, held--behind a simulacrum of many--by
one arm, sent for the purpose; for John Lawrence, being wise, knew
that the shadow of that arm meant more even than the sword it held to
the wildest half of the province under his control; a province
trembling in the balance between allegiance and revolt; a province
ready to catch fire if the extinguisher were not put upon the beacon
light. And all India waited too. Waited to see that sword fall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302940">But a hatchet fell first. Fell in the lemon thickets and
pomegranates of the walled old gardens outside the city, so that men
who worked at the batteries still remember the sweet smell that went
up from the crushed leaves; a welcome scent, for the Ridge, crowded
now with eleven thousand troops, was not a pleasant abode. It was on
Sunday the 6th of September that the final reinforcements came in, and
on the 7th the men, reading General Wilson's order for the appointing
of prize agents in each corps, and his assurance that all plunder
would be divided fairly, felt as if they were already within the
walls. The hospitals too were giving up their sick; those who could
not be of use going to the rear, Meerut-wards; those fit for work to
the front. And that night the first siege battery was traced and
almost finished below the Sammy-house, while, under cover of this
distraction on the right, the Koodsia Gardens and Ludlow Castle on the
left were occupied by strong picquets.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302941" n="391 AT LAST"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302942">But that first battery--only seven hundred yards from the Moree
bastion--had a struggle for dear life. The dawn showed but one gun in
position against all the concentrated fire of the bastion which,
during the night, had been lured into a useless duel with the old
defence-batteries above. Only one gun at dawn; but by noon--despite
assault and battery--there were five, answering roar for roar. Then
for the first time began that welcome echo--the sound of crumbling
walls, the grumbling roll of falling stones and mortar. By sunset the
gradually diminishing fire from the bastion had ceased, and the
bastion itself was a heap of ruins. By this time the four guns in the
left section of the battery were keeping down the fire from the
Kashmir gate, and so protecting the real advance through the
gardens.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302943">That was the first day of the siege, and Kate Erlton--sitting in
her little tent, which had been moved into a quiet spot, as she had
begged to be allowed to stay on the Ridge until some news came of the
man to whom she owed so much--thought with a shudder she could not
help, of what it must mean to many an innocent soul shut up within
those walls. It was bad enough here, where the very tent seemed to
shake. It must be terrible down there beside the heating guns, in the
roar and the rattle, the grime and the ache and strain of muscle. But
in the city--even in Sri Anunda's garden--!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302944">So, naturally enough, she wondered once more what could have become
of the man who had gone back to find her nearly ten days before.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302945">'May I come in? John Nicholson.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302946">She would have recognised the voice even without the name, for it
was not one to be forgotten. Nor was the owner, as he stood before
her, a letter in his hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302947">'I have heard from Mr. Douglas, Mrs. Erlton,' he said. 'It is in
the Persian character, so I presume it is no use showing it to
you. But it concerns you chiefly. He wants to know if you are safe. I
have to answer it immediately. Have you any message you would like to
send?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302948">'Any message,' she echoed. 'Only that he must come back at once, of
course.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302949">John Nicholson looked at her calmly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302951">'I shall say nothing of the kind,' he replied. 'It is best for a
man to decide such matters for himself.' She flushed up hotly. 'I had
not the slightest intention<pb xml:id="fswater_1302950" n="392 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> of dictating to Mr.--Mr. Douglas, General Nicholson;
considering how much he has already sacrificed for my sake--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302952">'You had better let him do as he likes, my dear madam,' interrupted
the General, with a sudden kindly smile, which, however, faded as
quickly as it came, leaving his face stern. 'He, like many another
man, has sacrificed too much for women, Mrs. Erlton; so if ever you
can make up to him for some of the pain do so--he is worth
it. Good-bye. I'll tell him that you are safe; but that in spite of
that, he has my permission to go ahead and kill--the more the
better.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302953">She had not the faintest idea why he made this last remark; but it
did not puzzle her, for she was occupied with his previous
one. Sacrificed too much! That was true. He carried the scars of the
knife upon him clearly. And the man who had just left her presence,
who, for all his courtesy, had treated her so cavalierly? had he scars
also? She was rather vexed with herself for feeling it, but a sudden
sense of being a poor creature came over her. It flashed upon her that
she could imagine a world without women--she was in one, almost, at
that very moment--but not a world without men; and yet that ceaseless
roar filling the air had more to do with women than men; it went more
as a challenge of revenge, than as a stern recall to duty--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302954">It was true. The men, working night and day in the batteries,
thought little of men's rights, only of women's wrongs. Even General
Wilson in his order had appealed to those under him on that ground
only, urging them to spend life and strength freely in vengeance on
murderers.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302955">And they did. Down in the scented Koodsia Gardens the men seemed
never to tire, never to shrink, though the shot from the city--not two
hundred and fifty yards away--flew <hi rend="italic">pinging</hi>
through the trees above them; but the high wall gave cover, and so
those off duty slept peacefully in the cool shade, or sat smoking on
the river-terrace.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302957">Thus, while the first battery, pounding away from the right at the
Moree and Kashmir bastions, diverted attention, and the enemy,
deceived by the feint, lavished a dogged courage in trying to keep up
some kind of reply, a second siege battery in two sections was traced
and made in front of Ludlow Castle five hundred yards from the Kashmir
Gate. By dawn on the 11th both sections were at work destroying<pb xml:id="fswater_1302956" n="393 AT LAST"/> the defences of the gate, and pounding away to
breach the curtain wall beside it. So the roar was doubled, and the
vibrations of the air began to quiver on the wearied ear almost
painfully. Yet they were soon trebled, quadrupled. Trebled by a party
of wide-mouthed mortars in the garden itself. Quadrupled by a wicked
dare-devil, impertinent little company of six eighteen-pounders and
twelve small mortars, which, with Medley of the Engineers as a guide,
took advantage of a half-ruined house to creep within a hundred and
sixty yards of the doomed walls, despite the shower of shell and
bullets from it; for by this time the Murderers in the city had found
out that the Men were at work at something in the scented thickets to
the left. Not that the discovery hindered the work. The native
pioneers who bore the brunt of it, digging and piling for the wicked
little intruder, were working with the master, working with
volunteers--officers and men alike--from the 9th Lancers and the
Carabineers. So, when one of their number toppled over, they looked to
see if he were dead or alive in order to sort him out properly. And if
he was dead they would weep a few tears as they laid him in the row
beside the others of his kind, before they went on with their work
quietly; for, having to decide whether a comrade belonged to the dead
or the living thirty-nine times one night, they began to get expert at
it. So by the 12th, fifty guns and mortars flashed and roared, and the
rumble of falling stones became almost continuous. Sometimes a shell
would just crest the parapet, burst, and bring away yards of it at a
time.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302958">Up on the Ridge behind the siege batteries, when the cool of
evening came on, every post was filled with sightseers watching the
salvos, watching the game. And one, at least, going back to get ready
for mess, wrote and told his wife at Meerut, that if she were at the
top of the Flagstaff Tower, she would remain there till the siege was
over--it was so fascinating. But they were merry on the Ridge in these
days, and the messes were so full that guests had to be limited at
one, till they got a new leaf in the table! Yet on the other slope of
the Ridge, men were tumbling over like the stones in the
walls. Tumbling over one after another in the batteries, all through
the night of the 12th, and the day of the 13th.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302960">Then at ten o'clock in the evening, men, sitting in the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302959" n="394 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> mess-tents, looked at each
other joyfully, yet with a thrill in their veins, as the firing ceased
suddenly. For they knew what that meant; they knew that down under the
very walls of the city, friends and comrades were creeping, sword in
one hand, their lives in the other, through the starlight, to see if
the breaches were practicable.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302961">But the city knew them to be so; and already the last order sent by
the palace to Delhi was being proclaimed by beat of drum through the
streets.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302962">So, monotonously, the cry rang from alley to alley.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302963">'<hi rend="italic">Intelligence having just been brought that the
infidel intend an assault to-night, it is incumbent on all, Hindu and
Mohammedan, from due regard to their faith, to assemble directly by
the Kashmir Gate, bringing iron picks and shovels with them. This
order is imperative.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302964">Newâsi Begum, amongst others, heard it as she sat
reading. She stood up suddenly, overturning the book-rest and the Holy
Word in her haste; for she felt that the crisis was at hand. She had
never seen Abool-Bukr since the night, now a whole month past, when he
had taunted her with being one more woman ready for kisses. Her pride
had kept her from seeking him, and he had not returned. But now her
resentment gave way before her fears. She <hi rend="italic">must</hi> see him--since God only
knew what might be going to happen!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302965">True in a way. But up on the Ridge one man felt certain of one
thing. John Nicholson, with the order for an assault at dawn safe in
his hand, knew that he would be in Delhi on the 14th September--a day
earlier than he had expected.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0505" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V<lb/>THROUGH THE WALLS</head><p xml:id="fswater_1302967">It was a full hour past dawn on the 14th September ere that sudden
silence fell once more upon the echoing rocks of the Ridge and the
scented gardens. So, for a second, the twittering of birds in the
thickets behind them might have been heard by the men who with fixed
bayonets were jostling the roses and the jasmines. But they were
holding their breath--waiting, listening for something very
different;<pb xml:id="fswater_1302966" n="395 THROUGH THE WALLS"/> while in the ears of
many, excluding all other sounds, lingered the cadence of a text read
by the chaplain before dawn in the church lesson for the day
<q><hi rend="italic">'Woe to the bloody city--the sword shall cut thee
off.'</hi></q></p><p xml:id="fswater_1302968">For--to many--the coming struggle meant neither justice nor
revenge, but religion; it was Christ against Anti-Christ. So, whether
for revenge or faith they waited; a thousand down by the river
opposite the Water Bastion; a thousand in the Koodsia facing the main
breach, with John Nicholson, first as ever, to lead it; a thousand
more on the broad white road fronting the Kashmir Bastion, with an
explosion party ahead to blow in the gate, and a reserve of fifteen
hundred to the rear waiting for success. Briefly, four thousand five
hundred men--more than half natives--waiting for the assault, facing
that half mile or so of northern wall, and tines within touch of each
other. Beyond, on the western trend, were two thousand more--mostly
untried troops from Jumoo and a general muster of casuals--to sweep
through the suburbs and be ready to enter by the Cabul Gate when it
was opened to them.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302969">Above on the Ridge, six hundred sabres awaited orders. Behind it
were three thousand sick in hospital, a weak defence, and that
rear-guard of graves. And in front of all stood that tall figure with
the keen eyes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302970">'Are you ready, Jones?' asked Nicholson, laying his hand nl the
last leader's shoulder. His voice and face were calm, almost cold.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302971">'Ready, sir!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302972">Then, startling that momentary silence, came the bugle.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302973">'<hi rend="italic">Advance!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302974">With a cheer the Rifles skirmished ahead joyfully. The engineers
posted in the furthest cover long before dawn--who had waited for
hours, knowing that each minute made their task harder--rose waving
their swords to guide the stormers towards the breach; then calmly, as
if it had been dark not daylight, crested the <hi rend="italic">glacis</hi> at a swift walk, followed by the laddermen
in line. Behind, with a steady tramp, came the two columns bound for
the breaches; but the third, upon the road, had to wait awhile, as,
like greyhounds from a leash, a little company slipped forward at the
double.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302976">Home of the Engineers first with two sergeants, a native <hi rend="italic">havildar</hi>,and ten Punjabee sappers, running lightly,
despite the<pb xml:id="fswater_1302975" n="396 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> twenty-five
pound powder bags they carried. Behind them, led by Salkeld, were the
firing party and a bugler. All running under the hail of bullets,
faster as they fell faster, as men run to escape a storm; but these
courted it, though the task had been set for night, and it was now
broad daylight.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302977">What then? They could see better. See the outer gateway open, the
footway of the drawbridge destroyed, the inner door closed save for
the wicket.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302978">'Come on,' shouted Home, and was across the bare beams like a boy,
followed by the others.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302979">Incredible daring! What did it mean? The doubt made the scared
enemy close the wicket hastily. So against it, at the rebels' very
feet, the powder bags were laid. True, one sergeant, fell dead with
his; but as it fell against the gates his task was done.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302980">'Ready, Salkeld!--your turn,' sang out young Home from the ditch,
into which, the bags laid, the fuse set, he dropped unhurt. So, across
the scant foothold came the firing party, its leader holding the
portfire. But the paralysis of amazement had passed; the enemy,
realising what the audacity meant, had set the wicket wide. It
bristled now with muskets; so did the parapet.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302981">'Burgess!--your turn,' called Salkeld as he fell, and passed the
portfire to the corporal behind hint. Burgess, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> Grierson--some one perchance retrieving a
past under a new name--took it, stooped, then with a half-articulate
cry either that it was 'right' or 'out,' fell back into the ditch
dead. Smith, of the powder party--lingering to see the deed
done--thought the latter, and, matchbox in hand, sprang forward,
cuddling the gate for safety as he struck a light. But it was not
needed. As he stooped to use it, the port-fire of the fuse exploded in
his face, and, half-blinded, he turned to plunge headlong for escape
into the ditch. A second after the gate was in fragments.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302982">'Your turn, Hawthorne!' came that voice from the ditch. So the
bugler, who had braved death to sound it, gave the advance. Once,
twice, thrice, lest the din from the breaches should drown it. Vain
precaution, not needed either; for the sound of the explosion was
enough. That thousand on the road was hungering to be no whit behind
the others, and with a wild cheer the stormers made for the gate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302984">But Nicholson was already nl Delhi, though ten miinutes<pb xml:id="fswater_1302983" n="397 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> had gone in a fierce struggle
against an avalanche of shot and stone ere they could place a single
ladder, ere he could slip into the ditch, and, calling on the 1st
Bengal Fusiliers to follow, escalade the bastion, first as ever.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302985">Even so, others were before him. Down at the Water Bastion, though
three-quarters of the laddermen had fallen and but a third of the
storming party remained, twenty-five men of the 8th had gained the
breach, and, followed by the whole column, were clearing the ramparts
towards the Kashmir Gate. Hence, again, without a check, joined by the
left half of Nicholson's column, they swept the enemy before them like
frightened sheep to the Moree Gate; though in the bastion itself, the
gunners stood to their guns and were bayoneted beside them. There,
with a whoop, some of the wilder ones leapt to the parapet to wave
their caps in exultation to the cavalry below, where, in obedience to
orders, it was now drawn up, ready to guard the flank of the assault,
despite the murderous fire from the Cabul gate, and the Burn bastion
beyond it; the troopers sitting in their saddles, motionless, doing
nothing, a mark for the enemy, yet still a wall of defence. So,
leaving then to that hardest task of all--the courage of inaction--the
victorious rush swept on to take the Cabul gate, to sweep past it up
to the Burn bastion itself--the last bastion which commanded the
position!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302986">And then? Then the order came to retire and await orders at the
Cabul gate. The fourth column after clearing the suburbs was to have
been there ready for admittance, ready to support. It was not. And
Nicholson was not there also, to dare and do all. He had had to pause
at the Kashmir gate to arrange that the column which had entered
through it should push on into the city, leaving the reserve to hold
the points already won; and now, with the 1st Fusiliers behind him, he
was fighting his way through the streets to the Cabul gate.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302987">So, fearing to lose touch with those behind, over-rating the
danger, under-estimating the incalculable gain of unchecked advance
with an eastern foe, the leader of that victorious sweeping of the
ramparts was content to set the English flag flying on the Cabul gate
and await orders. But the men had to do something; so they filled up
the time with plundering. And there were liquor shops about--Europe
shops full of wine and brandy.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302988" n="398 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302989">The flag had been flying over an hour when Nicholson came up. But
by that time the enemy--who had been flying too--flying as far as the
boat bridge in sheer conviction that the day was lost--had recovered
some courage and were back, crowding the bastion and some tall houses
beside it. And in the lane, three hundred yards long not ten feet wide
leading to it, two brass guns--posted before bullet-proof
screens--were ready to mow down the intruders.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302990">Yet once more John Nicholson saw but one thing; the Burn
bastion. Built by Englishmen, it was one of the strongest--the only
remaining one, in fact, likely to give trouble. With it untaken a
thorough hold on the city was impossible. Besides, with his vast
knowledge of native character he knew that the enemy had expected it
to be taken, and would construe caution into cowardice. Then he had
the 1st Bengal Fusiliers behind him. He had led them into Delhi, they
had fallen in his track in tens and fifties, and still they had come
on--they would do this thing for him now....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302991">'We will do what we can, sir,' said their commandant, Major
Jacob--but his face was grave.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302992">'We will do what men can do, sir,' said the commandant of that left
half of the column; 'but honestly, I don't think it can be done. We
have tried it once.' His face was graver still.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302993">'Nor I,' said Nicholson's brigade-major.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302994">Nicholson, as he stood by the houses around the Cabul gate which
had been occupied and plundered by the troops, looked down the
straight lane again. It hugged the city wall on its right, its scanty
width narrowed here and there by buttresses to some three feet. About
a third of the way down was the first gun, placed beside a feathery
<hi rend="italic">kikar</hi> tree which sent a lace-like tracery of
shadow upon the bullet proof screen. As far behind was the
second. Beyond, again, was the bastion jutting out, and so forcing the
lane to bend between it and some tall houses. Both were crowded with
the enemy, and the screens held bayonets and marksmen. There was a gun
in the wall close to the bastion, but to the left, citywards, in the
low flat-roofed mud houses there seemed no trace of flanking foes.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302995">'I think it can be done,' he said. He knew it must be done ere the
palace could be taken. So he gave the orders.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302996">'<hi rend="italic">Fusiliers forward! officers to the
front!</hi>'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1302997" n="399 THROUGH THE WALLS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1302998">And to the front they were, with a cheer and a rush, overwhelming
the first gun, within ten yards of the other. And one man was closer
still, for Lieutenant Butler, pinned against that second bullet-proof
screen by two bayonets thrust through the loopholes at him, had to
fire his revolver through them also, ere he could escape this
two-pronged fork.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1302999">But the fire of every musket on the bastion and the tall houses was
centred on that second gun. Grape, canister, raked the narrow
lane--made narrower by fallen Fusiliers--and forced those who remained
to fall back upon the first gun--beyond that even. Yet only for a
moment. Reformed afresh, they carried it a second time, spiked it, and
pressed on.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303000"><hi rend="italic">Officers still to the front!</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1303001">Just beyond the gun the commandant fell wounded to death. 'Go on,
men, go on!' he shouted to those who would have paused to help
him. 'Forward, Fusiliers!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303002">And they went forward, though at dawn two hundred and fifty men had
dashed for the breach, and now there were not a hundred and fifty left
to obey orders. Less! For fifty men and seven officers lay in that
lane itself! Surely it was time now for others to step in--and there
<hi rend="italic">were</hi> others!--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303003">Nicholson saw the waver, knew what it meant, and sprang forward
sword in hand, calling on those others to follow. But he asked too
much. Where the 1st Fusiliers had failed, none cared to try. That is
the simple truth. The limit had been reached.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303004">So for a minute or two he stood, a figure instinct with passion,
energy, vitality, before men who--God knows with reason--had lost all
three for the moment, a colossal figure beyond them, ahead of them,
asking more than mere ordinary men could do. So a pitiful figure--a
failure at the last!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303005">'Come on, men! Come on, you fools--come on you--you--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303006">What the word was, which that bullet full in the chest arrested
between heart and lips, those who knew John Nicholson's wild temper,
his indomitable will, his fierce resentment at everything which fell
short of his ideals, call easily guess.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303007">'Lay me under that tree,' he gasped, as they raised him. 'I will
not leave till the lane is carried. My God! Don't mind me--Forward,
men, forward! It <hi rend="italic">can</hi> be done.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303009">An hour or two afterwards a subaltern coning out of the<pb xml:id="fswater_1303008" n="400 THROUGH THE WALLS"/> Kashmir gate saw a <hi rend="italic">dhooli</hi> deserted by its bearers. In it lay John
Nicholson in dire agony; but he asked nothing of his fellows then save
to be taken to hospital. He had learnt his lesson. He had done what
others had set him to do. He had entered Delhi. He had pricked the
bubble, and the air was leaking out. But he had failed in the task he
had set himself. The Burn bastion was still unwon, and the English
force in Delhi, instead of holding its northern half up to the very
walls of the palace, secure from flanking foes, had to retire on the
strip of open ground behind the assaulted wall.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303010">If, indeed, it had not to retire further still; for if one man had
had his way it would have retired to the Ridge. Late in the afternoon,
when fighting was over for the day, General Wilson rode round the
new-won position, and, map in hand, looked despairingly towards the
network of narrow lanes and alleys beyond. And he looked at something
close at hand with even greater forebodings; for he stood in the
European quarter of the town among shops still holding vast stores of
wine and spirits which had been left untouched bythat other army of
occupation.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303011">But what of this one? This product of civilisation and culture and
Christianity--these men who could give points to those others in so
many ways, but might barter their very birthright for a bottle of rum?
Yet even so the position must be held. So said Baird-Smith at the
chief's elbow, so wrote Neville Chamberlain, unable to leave his post
on the Ridge. And another man in hospital, thinking of the Burn
bastion, thinking with a strange wonder of men who could refuse to
follow, muttered under his breath, 'Thank God! I have still strength
left to shoot a coward.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303012">And yet General Wilson in a way was right. Five days afterwards
Major Hodson wrote in his diary: The troops are utterly demoralised by
hard work and hard drink. For the first time in my life I have had to
see English soldiers refuse repeatedly to follow their
officers. Jacob, Nicholson, Greville, Speke were all sacrificed to
this.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303013">A terrible indictment indeed, against brave men.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303015">Yet not worse than that underlying the chief's order of the 15th,
directing the provost-marshal to search for and smash every bottle and
barrel to be found, and let the beer and wine, so urgently needed by
the sick, run into the gutters; or his admission three days later that
another attempt to take the Lahore gate had failed from '<hi rend="italic">the refusal of the European<pb xml:id="fswater_1303014" n="401 THROUGH THE WALLS"/> soldiers to follow their officers. One rush and it could have
been done easily...we are still, therefore, in the same position
to-day as we were yesterday</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303016">So much for drink.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303017">But the enemy luckily was demoralised also. It was still full of
defence; empty of attack. For one thing attack would have adniitted a
reverse; and over on that eastern wall of the palace, in the fretted
marble balcony overlooking the river there was no mention, even now,
of such a word. Reverse! Had not the fourth column been killed to a
man? Had not <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn</hi> himself fallen a victim
to valour? But Soma, and many a man of his sort, gave up the pretence
with bitter curses at themselves. They had seen from their own posts
that victorious escalade, that swift, unchecked herding of the
frightened sheep. And they--intolerable thought!--were sheep
also. They saw men with dark faces, no whit better than
they--better!--the Rajpoot had at least a longer record than the
Sikh!--led to victory while they were not led at all. So, brought face
to face once more with the old familiar glory and honour, the old
familiar sight of the master first--uncompromisingly, indubitably
first to snatch success from the grasp of Fate, and hand it back to
them--they thought of the past three months with loathing.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303018">And as for <hi rend="italic">Nikalseyn's</hi> rebuff? Soma, hearing
of it from a comrade, hot at heart as he, went to the place, and
looked down the lane as John Nicholson had done. By all the <hi rend="italic">Pandâvas</hi>! a place for heroes indeed! Ah! if
he had been there, he would have stayed there somehow. He walked up
and down it moodily, picturing the struggle to himself; thinking with
a curious anger of those men on the housetops, and in the bastion,
taking pot-shots at the unsheltered men below. That was all there
would be now. They might drive the masters back for a time, they might
inveigle them into lanes and reduce their numbers by tens and fifties;
and, men of his sort, might make a brave defence here and
there....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303019">Defence! Soma wanted to attack. Attracted by the faint shade of the
<hi rend="italic">kikar</hi> tree he sat down beneath it, resting
against the trunk, looking along the lane once more, just as a day or
two before John Nicholson had rested for a space. And the iron of
failure entered into this man's heart also, because there was none to
lead. And with the master there had been none to follow.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303020" n="402 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303021">Suddenly he rose, his mind made up. If that was so, let him go back
to the plough; it also was a hereditary trade.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303022">That night, without a word to any one, leaving his uniform behind
him, he started along the Rohtuck road for his ancestral village. But
he had to make a detour round the suburbs, for, despite that
annihilation spoken of in the palace, they were now occupied by the
English. Yet but very little headway had been made in securing a
firmer hold within the city itself.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303023">'You can't, till the Burn bastion is taken and the Lahore gate
secured,' said Nicholson from his dying bed, whence, growing
perceptibly weaker day by day, yet with mind clear and unclouded, he
watched and warned. The single eye was not closed yet, was not even
made dim by death. It saw still, what it had seen on the day of the
assault--what it had coveted then and failed to reach.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303024">But it was not for five days after this failure that even
Baird-Smith recognised the absolute accuracy of this judgment, and,
against the Chief's will, obtained permission to sap through the
shelter of the intervening houses till they could tackle the bastion
at close and commanding quarters, without asking the troops to face
another lane. So on the morning of the 19th, after a night of storm
and rain cooling the air incredibly, the pick-axe began what rifles
and swords had failed to do. By nightfall a tall house was reached,
whence the bastion could be raked fore and aft. Its occupants,
recognising this, took advantage of the growing darkness to evacuate
it. Half-an-hour afterwards the master-key of the position was in
English hands; rather unsteady ones, however, for here again the
troops--once more the 8th, the 75th, the Sikh infantry, and that
balance of the Fusiliers--had found more brandy.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303025">'<hi rend="italic">Poisoned, sir?</hi>' said one thirsty trooper,
flourishing a bottle of Exshaw's Number One before the eyes of his
Captain, who, as a last inducement to sobriety, was suggesting
danger. '<hi rend="italic">Not a bit of it. Capsules all
right.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303026">But this tine England could afford a few drunk men. The bastion was
gone, and by the Turkoman and Delhi gates half the town was going. And
not only the town. Down in the palace men and women, with fumbling
hands and dazed eyes, like those new roused from dreams, were
snatching at something to carry with them in their flight.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303027" n="403 THROUGH THE WALLS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303028">Bukht Khân himself stood facing the Queen in her favourite
summer-house, alone, save for Hâfzan, the scribe, who lingered,
watching them with a certain malice in her eyes. She had been
right. Vengeance had been coming. Now it had come.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303029">'All is not lost, my Queen,' said Bukht Khân, with hand on
sword. 'The open country lies before us, Lucknow is ours--come!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303030">'And the King, and my son,' she faltered. The dull glitter of her
tarnished jewellery seemed in keeping with the look on her face. There
was something sordid in it. Sordid, indeed, for behind that mask of
wifely solicitude and maternal care lay the thought of her hidden
treasure.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303031">'Let them come too. Naught hinders it.' True. But the gold, the
gold!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303032">After he had left her, impatient of her hesitation, a sudden terror
seized her, lest he might have sought the King, lest he might persuade
him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303033">'My bearers--woman: Quick!' she called to Hâfzan. 'Quick,
fool! my <hi rend="italic">dhooli</hi>!' But even dhooli-bearers have
to fly when vengeance shadows the horizon, and in that secluded corner
none remained. Every one was busy elsewhere--or from sheer terror
clustered together where soldiers were to be found.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303034">'The Ornament-of-Palaces can walk,' said Hâfzan, still with
that faint malice ini her face. 'There is none to see, and it is not
far.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303036">So, for the last time, Zeenut Maihl left the summer-house whence
she had watched the Meerut road: left it on foot, as many better
women, as unused to walking as she, were leaving Delhi with babies on
their breasts and little children toddling beside them. Past the faint
outline of the Pearl Mosque, through the cool damp of the watered
garden with the moon shining, overhead, she stumbled laboriously; then
up the steps of the audience-Hall towards a faint light by the
Throne. The King sate on it, almost in the dark; for the oil cressets
on a trefoil stand only seemed to make the shadows blacker. They lay
thick upon the roof, blotting out that circling boast. Before him
stood Bukht Khân, his hand still on his sword, broad,
contemptuously bold. But on either side of the shrunken figure, half
lost in the shadows also, Were other counsellors. Ahsan-Oolah, wily as
ever, Elâhi<pb xml:id="fswater_1303035" n="404 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> Buksh,
the time-server, who saw the only hope of safety in prompt
surrender.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303037">'Let the Pillar-of-Faith claim time for thought,' the latter was
saying. 'There is no hurry. If the <hi rend="italic">soubadar-sahib</hi> is in one, let him go--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303038">Bukht Khân broke in with an ugly laugh, 'Yea, Mirza-<hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>, I can go, but if I go the army goes with
me. Remember that. The King can keep the rabble. I have the
soldiers.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303039">Bahâdur Khân looked from one to the other
helplessly. Whether to go--risk all--endure a life of unknown
discomfort at his age, or remain, alone, unprotected, he knew not.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303040">'Yea! that is true. Still there is no need for hurry,' put in the
physician, with a glance at Elâhi Buksh. 'Let my master bid the
<hi rend="italic">soubadar</hi> and the army meet him at the tomb of
Humayon to-morrow morning. 'Twill be a more seemly time to leave than
now, like a thief in the night.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303041">Bukht Khân gave a sharp look at the speaker, then laughed
again. He saw the game. He scarcely cared to check it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303042">'So be it. But let it be before noon. I will wait no longer.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303043">As he passed out hastily he almost ran into a half-veiled figure,
which--with another behind it--was hugging one of the pillars, peering
forward, listening. He guessed it for the Queen, and paused
instantly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303044">''Tis thy last chance, Zeenut Maihl,' he whispered in her
ear. 'Come if thou art wise.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303045">The last. No! not that! The last for sovereignty perhaps, but not
for hidden treasure. Half an hour afterwards, a little procession of
Royal <hi rend="italic">dhoolies</hi> passed out of the palace on
their way to Elâhi Buksh's house beside the Delhi gate, and
Ahsan-Oolah walked beside the Queen's. He had gold also to save, and
he was wise; so she listened, and as she listened she told herself
that it would be best to stay. Her life was safe, and her son was too
young for the punishment of death. As for the King, he was too old for
the future to hold anything else.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303047">Hâfzan watched her go, still with that half-jeering smile,
then turned back into the empty palace. Even in the outer court it was
empty, indeed, save for a few fanatics muttering texts; and within the
precincts, deserted utterly, silent as the<pb xml:id="fswater_1303046" n="405 THROUGH THE WALLS"/> grave. Until, suddenly, from the Pearl Mosque a voice came,
giving the call to prayer; for it was not far from dawn.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303048">She paused, recognising it, and leaving the marble terrace where
she had been standing, looking riverwards, walked over to the
bronze-studded door, and peered in among the white arches of the
Mosque for what she sought.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303049">And there it was, a tall, white figure looking westward, its back
towards her, its arms spread skywards. A fanatic of fanatics.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303050">'Thou art not wise to linger here, Moulvie <hi rend="italic">sahib</hi>,' she called. 'Hast not heard? The
Burn-bastion is taken. The King and Queen have fled. The English will
be here in an hour or so, and then--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303051">'And then there comes judgment,' answered Mahomed Ismail, turning
to look at her sternly. 'Doth not it lie within these walls? I stay
here, woman, as I have stayed.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303052">'Nay, not here,' she argued in conciliatory tones. 'It lies yonder,
in the outer court, by the trees shadowing the little tank. Thon canst
see it from the window of my uncle's room. And he hath gone--like the
others. 'Twere better to await it there.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303053">She spoke as she would have spoken to a madman. And, indeed, she
held him to be little else. Here was a man, who had saved forty
infidels, whose reward was sure; and who must needs imperil it by
lingering where death was certain; must needs think of his battered
soul instead of his body! Mahomed Ismail came and stood beside her,
with the curious acquiescence in regard to details which is so often
seen in men mastered by one idea.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303054">'It may be better so, sister,' he said dreamily. ''Tis as well to
he prepared.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303055">Hâfzan's hard eyes melted a little, for she had a real pity
for this man who had haunted the palace persistently, and lost his
reason over his conscience.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303056">If she could once get him into leer uncle's room, she would find
some method of locking him in, of keeping him out of mischief. For
herself, being a woman, the <hi rend="italic">Huzoors</hi> were not to
be feared.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303057">'Yea! 'tis as well to be near,' she said as she led the way.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303059">And the time drew near also; for the dawn of the 20th September had
broken ere, with the key of the outer door in her bosom, she retired
into an inner room, leaving the Moulvie<pb xml:id="fswater_1303058" n="406 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> saying his prayers in the other. Already the troops,
recovered from their unsteadiness, had carried the Lahore gate and
were bearing down on the Mosque. They found it almost undefended. The
circling flight of purple pigeons, which at the first volley flew
westward, the sun glistening on their iridescent plumage, was scarcely
more swift than the flight of those who attempted a feeble
resistance. And now the palace lay close by. With it captured, Delhi
was taken. Its walls, it is true, rose unharmed, secure as ever,
hemming in those few acres of God's earth from the march of time; but
they were strangely silent. Only now and again a puff of white smoke
and all unnavailing roar told that some one, who cared not even for
success, remained within.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303060">So powder bags were brought, and Home of the Engineers sent for,
that he might have the honour of lighting the fuse which gave entry to
the last stronghold; for there was no hurry now; no racing now under
hailstorms, and over tight ropes. Calmly, quietly, the fuse was lit,
the gate shivered to atoms, and the long red tunnel with the gleam of
sunlight at its end lay before the men who entered it with a
cheer. Then, here and there rose guttural Arabic texts, ending in a
groan. Here and there the clash of arms. But not enough to rouse
Hâfzan, who, long ere this, had fallen asleep after her wakeful
night. It needed a touch on her shoulder for that, and the Moulvie's
eager voice in her ear.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303061">'The key, woman! The key--give it! I need the key.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303062">Half-dazed by sleep, deceived by the silence, she put her hand
mechanically to her bosom. His followed hers; he had what he sought,
and was oft. She sprang to her feet recognising some danger, and
followed him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303063">'He is mad! He is mad!' she cried, as her halting steps lingered
behind the tall white figure which made straight for a crowd of
soldiers gathered round the little tank. There were other soldiers
here, there, everywhere in the rose-red arcades around the wide
sun-lit court; soldiers with dark faces and white ones, seeking
victims, seeking plunder. But these in the centre were all white men,
and they were standing, as men stand to look at a holy shrine, upon
the place where, as the spies had told them, English women and
children had been murdered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303065">So towards them, while curses were in all hearts and on<pb xml:id="fswater_1303064" n="407 THROUGH THE WALLS"/> some lips, came the tall white figure
with its arms outspread, its wild eves aflame.<ref target="#fswatern407">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern407" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">This incident is imaginary.</note></p><p xml:id="fswater_1303066">'O God of Might and Right! Give judgment now, give judgment
now.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303067">The cry rolled and echoed through the arcades: to alien ears even
as those other cries which had ended in a groan.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303068">'He is mad--he saved them--he is mad!' gasped the maimed woman
behind; but her cry seemed no different either to those unheeding,
uncomprehending ears....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303069">So the tall white figure lay on its face, half a dozen bayonets in
its back, and half a dozen more were after Hâfzan.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303070">'Stick him! Stick him! A man in disguise. Remember the women and
children. Stick the coward!' She fled shrieking--shrill, feminine
shrieks; but the men's blood was up. They could not hear, they would
not hear; and yet the awkwardness of that flying figure made them
laugh horribly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303071">'Don't 'ustle 'im! Give 'im time! There's plenty o' run in 'im yet,
mates. Lord! 'e'd get first prize at 'Ackney Wick 'e would.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303072">Some one else, however, had got it at Harrow not a year before, and
was after the reckless crew. Almost too late--not
quite. Hâfzan, run to earth against a red wall, felt something
on her back, and gave a wild yell. But it was only a boy's hand.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303073">'My God! sir, I've stuck you!' faltered a voice behind, as a man
stood rigid, arrested in mid-thrust.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303074">'You d---d fool!' said the boy. 'Couldn't yon hear it was a woman?
I'll--I'll have you shot--Oh, hang it all! Drag the creature away,
some one--get out, do!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303075">For Hâfzan, as he stood stanching the blood from the slight
wound, had fallen at his feet and was kissing them frantically.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303076">But even that indignity was forgotten as the stained handkerchief
answered the flutter of something which at that moment caught the
breeze above him.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303077">It was the English flag.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303078">The men, forgetting everything else, cheered themselves
hoarse--cheered again when an orderly rode past waving a slip of paper
sent back to the General with the laconic report:</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303079">'<hi rend="italic">Blown open the gates! Got the Palace!'</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1303081">But Hâfzan, her veil up to prevent mistakes, limped over<pb xml:id="fswater_1303080" n="408 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> to where the Moulvie lay,
turned him gently on his back, straightened his limbs, and closed his
eyes. She would have liked to tell the truth to some one, but there
was no one to listen. So she left him there before the tribunal to
which he had appealed.</p></div><div xml:id="fswater_0506" n="6" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI<lb/>REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS</head><p xml:id="fswater_1303082">So the strain of months was over on the Ridge. Delhi was taken; the
Queen's health was being drunk night after night in the palace of the
Moghuls. But there was one person to whom the passing days brought a
growing anxiety. This was Kate Erlton: for there was no tiding of Jim
Douglas. None.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303083">At first she had comforted herself with the idea that he was still,
for some reason or another, keeping to the yet unconquered part of the
city; that he was obliged to do so being impossible, the long files of
women and children seeking safety and passing through the Ridge
fearlessly, precluding that consolation. Still it was conceivable he
might be busy, though it seemed strange he should have sent no
word. So, like many another in India at that time, she waited, hoping
against hope, possessing her soul in patience. She had no lack of
occupation to distract her. How could there be for a woman, when close
on twelve hundred men had come back from the city dead or wounded?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303084">But now the 21st of September was upon them. The city was occupied,
the work was over. Yet Captain Morecombe, coming back from it, shook
his head. He had spent time and trouble in the search, but had
failed--failed even, from Kate's limited ideas of their locality, to
find either Tara's lodging or the roof in the Mufti's quarter. She
could have found them herself, she said almost pathetically; but of
course that was impossible now, and would be so for some time to
come.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303085">'I am afraid it is no use, Mrs. Erlton,' said the Captain
kindly. 'There is not a trace to be found, even by Hodson's
spies. Unless he is shut up somewhere, he--he must be dead. It is so
likely that he should be; you must see that. Possibly before the siege
began. Let us hope so.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303086" n="409 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303087">'Why?' she asked quickly. 'You mean that there have been horrible
things done of late?--things like that poor English soldier who was
found chained outside the Kashmir gate as a target for his fellows?
Have there? I would so much rather know the worst--I used always to
tell Mr. Douglas so--it prevents one dreaming at night.' She shivered
as she spoke, and the man watching her felt his heart go out towards
her with a throb of pity. How long, he wondered irrelevantly, would it
take her to forget the miserable tragedy, to be ready for
consolation?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303088">'Yes, there have been terrible things on both sides,' he replied,
interrupting himself hastily with a sort of shame. 'There always
are. You can't help it when you sack cities. The Goorkhas had the
devil in them when I was down in the Mufti's quarter. They shot dozens
of helpless learned people in the Chelon-ke-kucha--one who coached me
up for my exams. And about twelve women in the house of a "Professor
of Arabic"--so he styled himself--jumped down the well to
escape--their own fears chiefly. For the men wanted loot, nothing
else. That is the worst of it. The whole story from beginning to end
seems so needless. It is as if Fate--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303089">She interrupted him quietly, 'It has been Fate. Fate from beginning
to end.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303090">He sat for an instant with a grave face, then looked up with a
smile. 'Perhaps. It's rather <hi rend="italic">apropos de bottes</hi>,
Mrs. Erlton, but I wanted to ask you a question. Hadn't you a white
cockatoo, once? When you first came here. I seem to recollect the bird
making a row in the verandah when I used to drive up.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303091">Her face grew suddenly pale, she sat staring at him with dread in
her eyes. 'Yes!' she replied with a manifest effort, 'I gave it to
Sonny Seymour because--because it loved him--' she broke off, then
added swiftly, eagerly, 'What then?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303092">'Only that I found one in the palace to-day. There is a jolly
marble-latticed balcony overlooking the river. The King used to write
his poetry there, they say. Well! I saw a brass cage hanging high up
on a hook--there has been no loot in the precincts, you know, for the
Staff has annexed them--I thought the cage was empty till I took it
down front sheer curiosity, and there was a dead cockatoo.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303093">'Dead!' echoed Kate, with a quick smile of relief. 'Oh! how glad I
am it was dead.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303094" n="410 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303095">Captain Morecombe stared at her. 'Poor brute!' he said under his
breath, 'It was skin and bone. Starved to death. I expect they forgot
all about it when they got really frightened. They are cruel devils,
Mrs. Erlton.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303096">The Major had used the self-same words to Alice Gissing eighteen
months before, and in the same connection. But, perhaps fortunately
for Kate in her present state of nervous strain, that knowledge was
denied to her; even so the coincidence of the bird itself absorbed
her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303097">'It had a yellow crest,' she began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303098">'Oh! then it couldn't have been yours,' interrupted Captain
Morecombe rather relieved, for he saw that he had somehow touched on a
hidden wound. 'This one was green--yellowish green. I daresay the king
kept pets like the Oude man--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303099">'It is dead, anyhow?' said Kate hurriedly.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303100">And the knowledge gave her a n unreasoning comfort. To begin with,
it seemed to her as if those fateful white wings, which had begun to
overshadow her world on that sunny evenning down by the Goomtee river,
had ceased to hover over it. And then this rounding of the tale--for
that the bird was little Sonny's favourite she did not doubt--made her
feel that Fate would not leave that other portion of it
unfinished. The inevitable sequence would be worked out somehow. She
would hear something. So once more she waited like many another;
waiting with eyes strained past the last known deed of gallantry for
the end which surely must have been nobler still. When that knowledge
came, she told herself, she would be content.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303101">There was yet another thing which held her to hope even more than
this; it was the remembrance of John Nicholson's words, 'If ever you
have a chance of making up.' They seemed prophetic; for he who spoke
them was so often right. Men talking of him as he lingered, watching,
advising, warning, despite dire agony of pain and drowsiness of
morphia, said there was none like him for clear insight into the very
heart of things.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303102">Yet he, as he lay without a complaint, was telling himself he had
been blind. He had sought more from his world than there was in
it. And so, though the news of the capture of the Burn-bastions
brought a brief rally, he sank steadily.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303104">But Hodson coming into his tent to tell him of the safe<pb xml:id="fswater_1303103" n="411 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/> capture of the king and queen
upon the 21st at Humayon's tomb, found him eager to hear all
particulars. So eager, that when the Sirdars of the Mooltanee Horse (a
regiment he had practically raised), who sat outside in dozens waiting
for every breath of news about their fetish, would not keep quiet, he
emphasised his third order by a revolver bullet through the wall of
the tent; greatly too their delight since, as they retired further
off; they agreed that <hi rend="italic">Nikkalseyn</hi> was <hi rend="italic">Nikkalseyn</hi> still; and surely death dare not claim
one so full of life?</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303105">Even Hodson smiled in the swift silence through which the labouring
breath of the dying man could be heard.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303106">'Well, sir,' he went on, 'as I was saying, I got permission, thanks
to you, to utilise my information--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303107">'You mean Rujjub Ali's and that sneak Elâhi-Buksh's, I
suppose,' put in Nicholson, 'It was sharp work. The king only went to
Humayon's tomb yesterday. They must have had it all cut and dried
before, surely?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303108">'The queen has been trying to surrender on terms some time back,
sir,' replied Hodson hastily. 'She has a lot of treasure--eight lakhs,
the spies tell me--and is anxious to keep it. However, to go on. After
stopping with Elâhi-Buksh that night--no doubt, as you say,
pressure was put on them then--they went off, as agreed, to meet
Bukht-Khân, but refused to go with him. Of course the promise
of their lives--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303109">'Then you were negotiating already?'<ref target="#fswatern411">1</ref><note xml:id="fswatern411" n="1" place="foot" resp="#auth">(Hodson in his diary says that the promise was
virtually given <hi rend="italic">two</hi> days before the capture,
which was on the 21st. It must therefore have been given on the
19th. <hi rend="italic">Most likely</hi> in Elâhi-Buksh's
house; if so on Hodson's own authority. <hi rend="italic">Query</hi>. Was he there in person?)</note></p><p xml:id="fswater_1303111">'Not exactly--but--but I couldn't have done without the promise
unless Wilson had agreed to send out troops, and he wouldn't. So I had
to give in, though personally I would a deal rather have brought the
old man in dead, than alive. Well, I set off this morning with fifty
of my horse and sent in the two messengers while I waited outside. It
was nearly two hours before they cane back, for the old man was hard
to move. Zeenut Maihl was the screw, and when Bahâdur
Shâh talked of his ancestors and wept, told him he should have
thought of that before he let Bukht-Khân and the army go. In
fact she did the business for me; but she stipulated<pb xml:id="fswater_1303110" n="412 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> for a promise of life from my own lips. So I
rode out alone to the causeway by the big gate--it is a splendid
place, sir, more like a mosque than a tomb--and drew up to
attention. Zeenut Maihl came out first, swinging along in her
curtained <hi rend="italic">dhooli</hi> and Rujjub, who was beside me,
called out her name and titles decorously. I couldn't help feeling it
was a bit of a scene, you know--my being there, alone, and all
that. Then the King came in his <hi rend="italic">palkee</hi>; so I
rode up, and demanded his sword. He asked if I were Hodson-<hi rend="italic">sahib bahadur</hi> and if I would ratify the promise? So
I had to choke over it, for there were two or three thousand of a
crowd by this time. Then we came away. It was a long five miles at a
footpace, with that crowd following us until we neared the city. Then
they funked. Besides I had said openly I'd shoot the King like a dog,
despite the promise, at the first sign of rescue. And that's all,
except that you should have seen the officers' face at the Lahore gate
when he asked me what I'd got in tow, and I said calmly, "Only the
King of Delhi." So that is done.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303112">'And well done,' said Nicholson, briefly, reaching out a parched
right hand. 'Well done, from the beginning to the end.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303113">Hodson flushed up like a girl, 'I'm glad to hear you say so, sir,'
he replied as nonchalantly, as he could, 'but personally, of course, I
would rather have brought him in dead.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303114">Even that slight action, however, had left Nicholson breathless,
and the only comment for a time came from his eyes; bright questioning
eyes, seeking now with a sort of pathetic patience to grasp the world
they were leaving, and make allowances for all shortcomings.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303115">'And now for the Princes,' said Hodson. 'Did you write to Wilson,
sir?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303116">Nicholson nodded, 'I think he'll consent. Only--only don't make any
more promises, Hodson. Some of them must be hung; they deserve
death.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303117">His hearer gave rather an uneasy look at the clear eyes, and
remarked sharply, 'You thought they deserved more than hanging once,
sir.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303119">The old imperious frown of quick displeasure at all challenge came
to John Nicholson's face, then faded into a half smile. 'I was not so
near death myself. It makes a<pb xml:id="fswater_1303118" n="413 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/>
difference. So good-bye, Hodson. I mayn't see you again.' He paused;
his smile grew clearer, and strangely soft. 'No news, I suppose, of
that poor fellow Douglas, who didn't agree with us?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303120">'None, sir; I warned him it was useless and foolhardy to go back,
when my information--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303121">'No doubt,' interrupted the dying man gently. 'Still, I'd have gone
in his place.' He lay still for a moment, then murmured to
himself. 'So he is on the way before me. Well! I don't think we can be
unhappy after death. And, as for that poor lady--when you see her,
Hodson, tell her I am sorry--sorry she hadn't her chance.' The last
words were once more murmured to himself and ended in silence.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303122">Kate Erlton, however, did not get the message which would, perhaps,
have ended her lingering hope. Major Hodson was too busy to deliver
it. Permission to capture the Princes was given him that very night,
and early next morning he set off to Humayon's tomb once more, with
his two spies, his second in conmand, and about a hundred troopers; a
small party indeed, to face the four or five thousand palace refugees
who were known to be in hiding about the tomb, waiting to see if the
princes could make terms like the king had done. But Hodson's orders
were strict. He was to bring in Mirza Moghul and Khair Sultân,
ex-Commanders-in-Cliief, and Abool-Bukr, heir presumptive,
unconditionally, or not at all.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303123">The morning was deliciously cool and crisp, full of that promise of
winter, which in its perfection of climate consoles the
Punjâbee for six months of purgatory. The sun sent a yellow
flood of light over the endless ruins of ancient Delhi which here
extend for miles on miles. It was a nasty country for skulking
enemies; but Hudson's pluck and dash were equal to anything, and he
rode along with a heart joyous at his chance, and full of
determination to avail himself of it and gain renown.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303125">Some one else, however, was early astir on this the 22nd of
September, so as to reach Humayon's Tomb in time to press on to the
Kutb, if needs be. This was the Princess Farkhoonda
Zamâni. Ever since that day, now more than a week past, when
the last message to the city had warned her that the supreme moment
for the house of Timoor was at hand, and she had started from her
study of Holy Writ, telling herself piteously that she must find
Prince Abool-Bukr--must,<pb xml:id="fswater_1303124" n="414 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> at
all sacrifice to pride, seek him, since he would not seek her--must
warn him and keep his hand in hers again--she had been distracted by
the impossibility of carrying out her decision. For, expecting an
immediate sack of the town, the Mufti's people had barricaded the only
exit bazaar-wards, and when, after a day or two, she did succeed in
creeping out, it was to find the streets unsafe, the palace itself
closed against all. But now, at least, there was a chance. Like all
the royal family, she knew of these two spies, Rujjub-Ali and Mirza
Elâhi-Buksh, who was saving his skin by turning Queen's
evidence. She knew of Hodson-<hi rend="italic">sahib's</hi> promise to
the king, and queen. She knew that Abool-Bukr was still in hiding with
the arch-offenders, Mirza Moghul and Khair Sultân, at Humayon's
tomb. Such an association was fatal; but if she could persuade him to
throw over his uncles, and go with her; and if, afterwards, she could
open negotiations with the Englishmen, and prove that Abool-Bukr had
been dismissed frmn office on the very day of the death-challenge and
had been in disgrace ever since--had even been condemned to death by
the king, as he had been once; surely she might yet drag her dearest
from the net into which Zeenut Maihl had lured him--with what bait she
scarcely trusted herself to think! The first thing to be done,
therefore, was to persuade Abool to come with her to some safer
hiding. She would risk all; her pride, her reputation, his very
opinion of her, for this. And surely a man of his nature was to be
tempted. So she put on her finest clothes, her discarded jewels, and
set off about noon in a <hi rend="italic">ruth</hi>--a sort of <hi rend="italic">dhoolie</hi> on wheels, drawn by oxen, gay with
trappings, and set with jingling bells. They let her pass at the Delhi
gate, after a brief look through the curtains, during which she
cowered into a corner without covering her face, lest they might think
her a man, and stop her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303126">'By George! that was a pretty woman,' said the English subaltern,
who passed her, as he came back to the guardroom. 'Never saw such eyes
in my life. They were as soft, as soft as--well! I don't know
what. And they looked, somehow, as if they have been crying for years,
and--and as if they saw--saw something, you know.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303127">'They saw you--you sentimental idiot--that's enough to make any
woman cry,' retorted his companion. And then the two, mere boys, wild
with success and high spirits, fell to horse-play over the
insult.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303128" n="415 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303129">Yet the first boy was right. Newâsi's eyes had seen
something day and night, night and day, ever since they had strained
into the darkness after Prince Abool-Bukr when he broke from her kind
detaining hand and disappeared from the Mufti's quarter. And that
something was a flood of sunlight holding a figure, as she had seen it
more than once, in a wild unreasoning paroxysm of sheer terror. It
seemed to her as if she could hear those white lips gasping once more
over the cry which brought the vision. 'Why did'st not let me live
mine own life, die mine own death? but to die--to die needlessly--to
die in the sunlight perhaps.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303130">There was a flood of it now outside the <hi rend="italic">ruth</hi>
as it lumbered along by the jail, not a quarter of a mile yet from the
city gate. Half-shivering she peeped through the gay patchwork
curtains to assure herself it held no horror.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303131">God and his Holy Prophet! What was that crowd on the road ahead?
No: not ahead; she was in it, now, so that the oxen paused, unable to
go on: a crowd, a cluster of spearpoints, and then, against the jail
wall, an open space round another <hi rend="italic">ruth</hi>, an
Englishman on foot, three figures stripped--No; not three! only two,
for one had fallen as the crack of a carbine rang through the startled
air. Two?--But one, now--and that....</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303132">Oh! saints have mercy! the vision , the vision! It was Abool,
dodging like a hare, begging for bare life--seeking it, at last, out
of the sunshine, under the shadow of the <hi rend="italic">ruth</hi>
wheels.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303133">'Abool! Abool!' she screamed. 'I am here. Come! I am here.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303135">Did he hear the kind voice? He may have, for it echoed clear before
the third and final crack of the carbine. So clear that the driver,
terrified lest it should bring like punishment on him, drove his goad
into the oxen; and the next instant they were careering madly down a
side road, bumping over watercourses and ditches. But Newâsi
felt no more buffetings. She lay huddled up inside, as unconscious as
that other figure which, by Major Hodson's orders, was being dragged
out from under the wheels and placed upon it beside the two other
corpses for conveyance to the city. And none of all the crowd,
ready--so the tale runs--to rescue the princes lest death should be
their portion in the future, raised voice or hand to avenge them now
that it had come so ruthlessly, so wantonly. Perhaps the English guard
at the Delhi gate cowed them, as<pb xml:id="fswater_1303134" n="416 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> it had cowed those who the day before had followed the King
so far, then slunk away.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303136">So the little <hi rend="italic">cortège</hi> moved on
peacefully; far more peacefully than the other <hi rend="italic">ruth</hi>, which, with its unconscious burden, was
racing Kutb-wards as if it was afraid of the very sunshine. But the
Princess Farkhoonnda, huddled up in all her jewels and fineries, had
forgotten even that--forgotten even that vision seen in it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303137">Hodson, however, as he rode at ease behind the dead princes seemed
to court the light. He gloried in the deed, telling himself that 'in
less than twenty-four hours he had disposed of the principal members
of the House of Timoor'; so fulfilling his own words written weeks
before, 'If I get into the palace, the House of Timoor will not he
worth five minutes purchase, I ween'--telling himself also, that in
shooting down with his own hand, men who had surrendered without
stipulations to his generosity and clemency--surrendered to a hundred
troopers when they had five thousand men behind them--he 'had rid the
earth of ruffians'--telling himself that he was 'glad to have had the
opportunity, and was game to face the moral risk of praise or
blame.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303138">He got the former unstintingly from most of his fellows as, in
triumphant procession, the bodies were taken to the chief police
station, there to be exposed, so say the eye-witnesses, 'In the very
spot where, four months before, Englishwomen had been outraged and
murdered, in the very place where their helpless victims had
lain.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303139">A strange perversion of the truth, responsible, perhaps, not only
for the praise, but for the very deed itself. So Mahomed Ismail's
barter of his truth and soul for the lives of the forty prisoners at
the Kotwâl counted for nothing in the judgment of this
world.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303140">But Hodson lacked either praise or blame from one man. John
Nicholson lay too near the judgment of another world to he disturbed
by vexed questions in this; and when the next morning came, men,
meeting each other said, sadly, 'He is dead.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303141">The news, brought to Kate Erlton by Captain Morecombe when he came
over to report another failure, took the heart out of even <hi rend="italic">her</hi>
hope.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303142">'There is no use in my staying longer, I'm afraid,' she said
quietly 'I am only in the way. I will go back to Meerut and then
home--to the boy.'</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303143" n="417 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303144">'I think it would be best,' he replied kindly. 'I can arrange for
you to start to-morrow morning. You will be the better for a change;
it will help you to forget.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303145">She smiled a little bitterly; but when he had gone she set to work,
packing up such of her husband's things as she wished the boy to have
with calm deliberation; and early in the afternoon she went over to
the garden of her old house to get some fresh flowers for what would
be her last visit to that rearguard of graves; to take, also, her last
look at the city, and watch it grow mysterious in the glamour of
sunset.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303146">Seen from afar it seemed unchanged. A mass of rosy-light and
lilac-shadow, with the great white dome of the Mosque hanging airily
above the smoke-wreaths. Yet the end had come to its four months'
dream as it had come to hers. Rebellion would linger long, but its
stronghold, its very <hi rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> was
gone. And Memory would last longer still; yet surely it would not be
all bitter? Hers was not. Then with a rush of real regret she thought
of the peaceful roof, of old Tiddu, of the Princess
Farkhoonda--Tara--Soma--of Sri Anunda in his garden. Was she to go
home to safe, smug England, live in a suburb, and forget? Forget all
but the tragedy! Yet even that held beautiful memories. Alice Gissing
under young Mainwaring's scarf, while he lay at her feet. Her husband
leaving a good name to his son? Did not these things help to make the
story perfeet. No! not perfect; and with the remembrance her eyes
filled with sudden team. There would always be a blank for her in the
record. The Spirit which had moved on the Face of the Waters, bringing
their chance of Healing and Atonement to so many, had left hers in the
shadow. She had learnt her lesson. Ah! yes; she had learnt it. But the
chance of using it?...</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303147">As she sat on the plinth of the ruined verandah, watching the city
growing dim through the mist of her tears, John Nicholson's words came
back to her once more, 'If ever you have the chance'; but it would
never come now--never! She started up wildly at the clutch of a brown
hand on her wrist, a brown hand with a circlet of dead gold above
it.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303148">'Come!' said a voice behind her; 'come quick! He needs you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303149">'Tara!' she gasped--'Tara! Is--is he alive then?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303151">'He would not need the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> if he were dead,'
came the<pb xml:id="fswater_1303150" n="418 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> swift reply. Then
with her wild eyes fixed on another gold circlet upon the wrist she
held, Tara laughed shrilly. 'So the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> wears
it still. She has not forgotten. Women do not forget, white or
black'--With a strange stamp of her foot she interrupted herself
fiercely--'come, I say, come!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303152">If there had been doubts as to the Rajpootni's sanity at times in
past days, there was none now. A glance at her face was sufficient. It
was utterly distraught, the clutch on Kate's arm utterly uncontrolled;
so that, involuntarily, the latter shrank back.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303153">'The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> is afraid,' cried Tara
exultantly. 'So be it! I will go back and tell the master. Tell him I
was right and he wrong, for all the English he chattered. I will tell
him the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> is not <hi rend="italic">suttee</hi>--how could she be--'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303154">The old taunt roused many memories, and made Kate ready to risk
anything. 'I am coming, Tara--but where?' She stood facing the tall
figure in crimson, a tall figure also, in white, her hands full of the
white roses she had gathered.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303155">Tara looked at her with that old mingling of regret and
approbation, jealousy and pride. 'Then she must come at once. He is
dying--may be dead ere we get back.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303156">'Dead! ' echoed Kate faintly. 'Is he wounded then?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303157">A sort of sombre sullenness dulled the excitement of Tara's
face. 'He is ill,' she replied laconically. Suddenly, however, she
burst out again: 'The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> need not look so! I
have done all--all she could have done. It is his fault. He will not
take things. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> can do no more; but I have
come to her, so that none shall say, "Tara killed the master." So
come. Come quick!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303159">Five minutes after Kate was swinging citywards in a curtained <hi rend="italic">dhooli</hi> which Tara had left waiting on the road
below, and trying to piece out a consecutive story from the odd jumble
of facts, and fancies, and explanations which Tara poured into her ear
between her swift abuse of the bearers for not going faster, and her
assertion that there was no need to hurry. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> need not hope to save the <hi rend="italic">Huzoor</hi>, since everything had been done. It seemed,
however, that Tiddu had taken back the letter telling of Kate's
safety, and that in consequence of this the master had arranged to
leave the city in a day or two, and Tiddu--born liar and gold grubber,
so the Rajpootni styled him--had gone off at once to make more
money. But on the very eve of his going back to<pb xml:id="fswater_1303158" n="419 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/> the Ridge, Jim Douglas had been struck down with
the Great Sickness, and after two or three days, instead of getting
better, had fallen--as Tara put it--into the old way. So far Kate made
out clearly; but from this point it became difficult to understand the
reproaches, excuses, pathetic assertions of helplessness, and fierce
declarations that no one could have done more. What was the use of the
<hi rend="italic">Huzoor's</hi> talking English all night when even a
<hi rend="italic">suttee</hi> could not go out because every one was
being shot in the streets? Besides, it was all obstinacy. The master
could have got well if he had tried. And who was to know where to find
the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi>? Indeed, if it had not been for Sri
Anunda's gardener, who knew all the gardener folk, of course, she
would not have found the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> even now; for she
would never have known which house to inquire at. Not that it would
have mattered, since the <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> could do
nothing--nothing!--nothing--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303160">Kate, looking down on the bunch of white flowers which she had
literally been too hurried to think of laying; aside, felt her heart
shrink. They were rather a fateful gift to be in her hands now. Had
they come there of set purpose, and would the man who had done so much
for her be beyond all care save those pitiful offices of the dead?
Still, even that was better than that he should lie alone,
untended. So, urged by Tara's vehement upbraidings, the <hi rend="italic">dhooli</hi>-bearers lurched along, to stop at last. It
seemed to Kate as if her heart stopped also. She could not think of
what might lie before her as she followed Tara up the dark,
strangely-familiar stair. Surely, she thought, she would have known it
among a thousand. And there was the step on which she had once
crouched terror-stricken, because she was shut out from shelter
within; but now Tara's fingers were at the padlock, Tara's hand set
the door wide.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303161">Kate paused on the threshold, feeling, in truth, dazed once more at
the strange familiarity of all things. It seemed to her as if she had
but just left that strip of roof a-glow with the setting sun, the
bubble dome of the Mosque beginning to flush like a cloud upon the
sky. But Tara, watching her with resentful eyes, put a different
interpretation on the pause, and said quickly--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303162">'He is within. The <hi rend="italic">mem</hi> was away, and it was
quieter. But the rest is all the same--there is nothing
forgotten--nothing.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303164">Kate, however, heard only the first words, and was already<pb xml:id="fswater_1303163" n="420 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> across the outer roof to gain
the inner one. Tara, still beyond the threshold, watched her
disappear, then stood listening for a minute, with a face tragic in
its intensity. Suddenly a faint voice broke the silence, and her
hands, which had been tightly clenched, relaxed. She closed the door
silently, and went downstairs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303165">Meanwhile Kate, on the inner roof, had paused beside the low string
bed set in its middle, scarcely daring to look at its burden, and so
put hope and fear to the touchstone of truth. But as she stood
hesitating, a voice, querulous in its extreme weakness, said in
Hindustani--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303166">'It is too soon, Tara; I don't want anything; and--and you needn't
wait--thank you.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303167">He lay with his face turned from her, so she could stand, wondering
how best to break her presence to him, noting with a failing heart the
curious slackness, the lack of contour even on that hard string
bed. He seemed lost, sunk in it; and she had seen that sign so often
of late that she knew what it meant. One thing was certain, he must
have food--stimulants if possible--before she startled him. So she
stole back to the outer roof, expecting to find Tara there, and Tara's
help. But the roof lay empty, and a sudden fear lest, after all, she
had only come to see him die, while she was powerless to fight that
death from sheer exhaustion which seemed so perilously near, made her
put down the bunch of flowers she held with an impatient gesture. What
a fool she had been not to think of other things!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303168">But as she glanced round, her eye fell on a familiar earthenware
basin, kept warm in a pan of water over the ashes. It was full of
'chikken-brât,' and excellent of its kind too. Then in a niche
stood milk and eggs--a bottle of brandy, arrowroot--everything a nurse
could wish for. And in another, evidently in case the brew should be
condemned, was a fresh chicken ready for use. Strange sights these to
bring tears of pity to a woman's eyes; but they did. For Kate, reading
between the lines of poor Tara's confusion, began to understand the
tragedy underlying those words she had just heard--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303169">'<hi rend="italic">I don't want anything, Tara. And you needn't
wait, thank you</hi>.' She seemed to see, with a flash, the long long
days which had passed, with that patient, polite negative coming to
chill the half-distraught devotion.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303170" n="421 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303171">He must take something
now, for all that. So, armed with a cup and spoon, she went back,
going round the bed so that he could see her.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303172">'It is time for Your food, Mr. Greyman,' she said quietly; when you
have taken some, 'I'll tell you everything. Only you must take this
first.' As she slipped her hand under him, pillow and all, to raise
his head slightly, she could see the pained, puzzled expression narrow
his eyes as he swallowed a spoonful. Then with a frown he turned his
head from her impatiently.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303173">'You must take three,' she insisted; you must, indeed,
Mr. Greyman. Then I will tell you--everything.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303174">His face came back to hers with the faintest shadow of his old
mutinous sarcasm upon it, and he lay looking at her deliberately for a
second or two. 'I thought you were a ghost,' he said feebly at last;
'only they don't bully. Well! let 's get it over.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303175">The memory of many such a bantering reply to her insistance in the
past sent a lump to her throat and kept her silent. The little low
stool on which she had been wont to sit beside him was in its old
place, and half mechanically she drew it closer, and, resting her
elbow on the bed as she used to do, looked round her, feeling as if
the last six weeks were a dream. Tara had told truth. Everything was
in its place. There were flowers in a glass, a spotless fringed cloth
on the brass platter. The pity held in these trivial signs brought a
fresh pang to her heart for that other woman.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303176">But Jim Douglas, lying almost in the arms of death, was not
thinking of such things.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303177">'Then Delhi must have fallen,' he said suddenly in a stronger
voice. 'Did Nicholson take it?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303178">'Yes,' she replied quietly, thinking it best to be concise and give
him, as it were, a fresh grip on facts. 'It has fallen. The king is a
prisoner, the princes have been shot, and most of the troops move on
to-morrow towards Agra.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303179">Her words epitomised the situation beyond the possibility of doubt,
and he gave a faint sigh. 'Then it is all over. I'm glad to hear
it. Tara never knew anything; and it seemed so long.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303181">Had she known and refused to tell, Kate wondered? or in her insane
absorption had she really thought of nothing but the chance Fate had
thrown in her way of saving this<pb xml:id="fswater_1303180" n="422 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> man's life? Yes! it must have been very long. Kate realised
this as she watched the spent and weary face before her, its bright
hollow eyes fixed on the glow which was now fast fading from the
dome. 'All over!' he murmured to himself. 'Well! I suppose it couldn't
be helped.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303182">She followed his thought unerringly; and a great pity for this man
who had done nothing, where others had done so much, surged up in her
and made her seek to show his fate no worse than others. Besides, this
discouragement was fatal, for it pointed to a lack of that desire for
life which is the best weapon against death. She might fail to rouse
him, as those had failed who, but a day or two before, had sent a bit
of red ribbon representing the Victoria Cross to the dying
Salkeld--the hero of the Kashmir Gate--and only gained in reply a
faint smile and the words, 'They will like it at home.' Still she
would try.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303183">'Yes, it is over!' she echoed, 'and it has cost so many lives
uselessly. General Nicholson lost his trying to do the impossible--so
people say.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303184">Jim Douglas still lay staring at the fading glow. 'Dead!' he
murmured. 'That is a pity. But he took Delhi first. He said he
would.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303185">'And my husband,' she began.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303186">He turned then, with curiously patient courtesy. 'I know. Nicholson
wrote that in his letter. And I have been glad--glad he had his
chance, and--and--made so much of it.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303187">Once more she followed his thought; and knew that, though he was
too proud to confess it, he was saying to himself that he had had his
chance too and had done nothing. So she answered him as if he had
spoken.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303188">'And you had your chance of saving a womnan,' she said, with a
break in her voice, 'and you saved her. It isn't much, I suppose. It
counts as nothing to you. Why should it? But to me--' she broke off,
losing her purpose for him in her own bitter regret and vague
resentment. 'Why didn't you let them kill me, and then go away,' she
went on almost passionately, 'it would have been better than saving me
to remember always that I stood in your way--better than giving me no
chance of repaying you for all--ah! think how much! Better than
leaving me alone to a new life--like--like all the others have
done.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303190">She buried her face on her arm as it rested on the pillow<pb xml:id="fswater_1303189" n="423 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/> with a sob. This, then, was the
end, she thought, this bitter unavailing regret for both.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303191">So for a space there was silence while she sat with her face
hidden, and he lay staring at that darkening dome. But suddenly she
felt his hot hand find hers; so thin, so soft, so curiously strong
still in its grip.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303192">'Give me some more wine or something,' came his voice
consolingly. 'I'll try and stop--if I can.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303193">She made an effort to smile back at him, but it was not very
successful. His, as she fed him, was better; but it did not help Kate
Erlton to cheerfulness, for it was accompanied by a murmur that the
<hi rend="italic">chikken brât</hi> was very different from
Tara's stuff. So she seemed to see a poor ghost glowering at them from
the shadows, asking her how she dared take all the thanks. And the
ghost remained long after Jim Douglas had dozed off; remained to ask,
so it seemed to Kate Erlton, every question that could be asked about
the mystery of womanhood and manhood.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303194">But Tara herself asked none when in the first grey glimmer of dawn
she crept up the stairs again and stood beside the sleepers. For Kate,
wearied out, had fallen asleep crouched up on the stool, her head
resting on the pillow, her arm flung over the bed to keep that touch
on his hand which seemed to bring him rest. Tara, once more in her
widow's dress, looked down on them silently, then threw her bare arms
upwards. So for a second she stood, a white-shrouded appealing figure
against that dark shadow of the dome which blocked the paling eastern
sky. Then stooping, her long, lissome fingers busied themselves
stealthily with the thin gold chain about the sick man's neck; for
there was something in the locket attached to it which was hers by
right now. Hers, if she could have nothing else; for she was <hi rend="italic">suttee--suttee!</hi></p><p xml:id="fswater_1303196">The unuttered cry was surging through her heart and brain, rousing
a mad exultation in her, when half-an-hour afterwards she re-entered
the narrow lane leading to the arcaded courtyard with the black old
shrine hiding under the tall peepul tree. And what was that hanging
over the congeries of roofs and stairs, the rabbit warren of rooms and
passages where her pigeon-nest was perched? A canopy of smoke, and
below it leaping flames. There were many wanton fires in Delhi during
those first few days of licence, and this was one of them; but
already, in the dawn, English<pb xml:id="fswater_1303195" n="424 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> officers were at work giving orders, limiting the danger as
much as possible.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303197">'We can't save that top bit,' said one at last, then turned to one
of his fatigue party. 'Have you cleared everybody out, sergeant, as I
told you?'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303198">'Yes, sir! it's quite empty.'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303199">It had been so five minutes before. It was not now; for that canopy
of smoke, those licking tongues of flame, had given the last touch to
Tara's unstable mind. She had crept up and up, blindly, and was now on
her knees in that bare room set round with her one scrap of culture,
ransacking an old basket for something which had not seen the light
for years--her scarlet, tinsel-set, wedding dress. Her hands were
trembling, her wild eves blazed like fires themselves.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303200">And below, men waited calmly for the flames to claim this, their
last prize: for the turret stood separated from the next house.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303201">'My God!' came an English voice, as something showed suddenly upon
the roof. 'I thought you said it was empty--and that's a woman!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303202">It was. A woman in a scarlet, tinsel-set dress, and all the poor
ornaments she possessed upon her widespread arms. So, outlined against
the first sun-ray she stood, her shrill chanting voice rising above
the roar and rush of the flames.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303203">'<hi rend="italic">Oh ! Guardians eight, of this world and the
next. Sun, Moon, and, Air, Earth, Ether, Water, and my own poor soul
bear witness! Oh! Lord of death, bear witness that I come. Day, Night,
and Twilight say I am suttee.</hi>'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303204">There was a louder roar, a sudden leaping of the flames, and the
turret sank inwardly. But the chanting voice could be heard for a
second in the increasing silence which followed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303205">'Shiv-<hi rend="italic">jee</hi> hath saved His own,' said the
crowd, looking towards the unharmed shrine.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303206">And over on the other side of the city, Kate Erlton, roused by that
same first ray of sunlight, was looking down with a smile upon Jim
Douglas before waking him. The sky was clear as a topaz, the purple
pigeons were cooing and sidling on the copings. And in the bright,
fresh light she saw the gold locket lying open on the sleeper's
breast. She had often wondered what it held, and now--thinking he
might not care to find it at her mercy--stooped to close it.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303207" n="425 REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303208">But it was empty.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303209">The snap, slight as it was, roused him. Not however to a knowledge
of the cause, for he lay looking up at her in his turn.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303210">'So it is all over,' he said softly, but he said it with a
smile.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303211">Yes! It was all over. Down on the parade ground behind the Ridge
the bugles were sounding, and the men who had clung to the red rocks
for so long were preparing to leave them for assault elsewhere.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303212">But one man was taking all eternal hold upon them; for John
Nicholson was being laid in his grave. Not in the rearguard however,
but in the van, on the outermost spur of the Ridge abutting on the
city wall, within touch almost of the Kashmir Gate. Being laid in his
grave--by his own request--without escort, without salute; for he knew
that he had failed.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303213">So he lies there facing the city he took. But his real grave was in
that narrow lane within the walls where those who dream can see him
still, alone, ahead, with yards of sheer sunlight between him and his
fellow-men.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303214">Yards of sheer sunlight between that face with its confident glance
forward, that voice with its clear cry, 'Come on, men, come on,' and
those--the mass of men--who with timorous look backwards hear in that
call to go forward nothing but the vain regret for things familiar
that must be left behind--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303215">'Going, going, gone!'</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303216">So, in a way, John Nicholson stands symbol of the many lives lost
uselessly in the vain attempt to go forward too fast.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303217">Yet his voice echoes still to the dark faces and the light
alike--</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303218">'Come on, men! Come on!'</p></div></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1303219" n="[426]"/><div xml:id="fswater_0600" n="6" type="book"><head>BOOK VI</head><div xml:id="fswater_0601" n="1" type="appendix"><head>APPENDIX A<lb/>[<hi rend="italic">Enclosed in Appendix B</hi>]</head><div xml:id="fswater_0602" type="letter"><head><hi rend="italic">From</hi><name type="person">A.

have the honour to enclose a brief statement, which for convenience'
sake I have drafted under the usual headings of the annual report

from a real one, or from official papers published at the time. I am
responsible for nothing but--very occasionally--the
wording.</note>--So far as my district is concerned, the late
disturbances have simply been a military mutiny. At no time could they
be truthfully called a rebellion. In the outlying posts, indeed, the
people knew little or nothing of what was going on around them, and
even in the towns resistance was not thought of until the prospect of
any immediate suppression of the mutiny disappeared.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303222">The small force of soldiers in my district of course followed the
example of their brethren. Nothing else could be expected from our
position midway between two large cantonments; indeed the continuous
stream of mutinous troops which passed up and down the main road
during the summer had a decidedly bad effect.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303224">I commenced to disperse the disturbers of the public peace on the
21st May. These were largely escaped felons from the Meerut jail; and
the fact that they were quite indiscriminate in their lawlessness
enabled me to rally most of the well-doing people on my side. I<pb xml:id="fswater_1303223" n="427 APPENDIX A"/> hanged a few of the offenders, and having
enlisted a small corps with the aid of some native gentlemen (whose
names I append for reference), sent it out under charge of my
assistant (I myself being forced throughout the whole business to
remain at headquarters and keep a grip on things) to put down some
Goojurs and other predatory tribes who took occasion to resort to
their ancestral habits of life.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303225">No real opposition, however, was ever met with; but in June (after
our failure to take Delhi by a <hi rend="italic">coup de main</hi>
became known) there was an organised attempt to seize the
Treasury. Fortunately I had some twenty or thirty of my new levy in
headquarters at the time, so that the attempt failed and I was able to
bring one or two of the ringleaders (one, I regret to say, a man of
considerable importance in my district) to justice.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303226">I subsequently made several applications to the nearest cantonment
for a few European soldiers to escort my treasure--some two lakhs--to
safer quarters. But this, unfortunately, could not be granted to me,
so I had to keep a strong guard of men over the money, who might have
been more useful elsewhere.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303227">Until the fall of Delhi matters remained much the sauce. Isolated
bands of marauders ravaged portions of my district, often, I regret to
say, escaping before punishment could be meted out to them. The
general feeling was one of disquiet and alarm to both Europeans and
natives. My table attendant, for instance, absented himself from
dinner one day, sending a substitute to do his work, under the belief
that I had given orders for a general slaughter of Mahommedans that
evening. I had done nothing of the kind.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303228">After the fall of Delhi, as you are aware, the mutinous fugitives,
some fifty or sixty thousand strong, marched southwards in a compact
body and caused us much alarm. But after camping on the outskirts of
my district for a few days, they suddenly disappeared. I am told they
dispersed during one night, each to his own home. Anyhow they
literally melted away, and the public mind seemed to become aware that
the contest was over, and that the struggle to subvert British rule
had ignominiously failed. Matters therefore assumed a normal aspect,
but I believe that there is more shame, sorrow, and regret in the
hearts of many than we shall probably ever have full cognisance of,
and that it will take years for the one race to regain its confidence,
the other its self-respect.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303229"><hi rend="italic">Civil Judicature</hi>.--The courts were
temporarily suspended for a week or two; after that original work went
on much as usual, but the appellate work suffered. There was an
indisposition both to institute and hear appeals, possibly due to the
total eclipse of the higher appellate courts. I myself had little
leisure for civil cases.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303231"><hi rend="italic">Criminal Justice</hi>.--There has been far less
crime than usual during the past year. Possibly because much of it had
necessarily to be<pb xml:id="fswater_1303230" n="428 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> treated
summarily and so did not come on the record. I am inclined to believe,
however, that petty offences really are fewer when serious crime is
being properly dealt with.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303232"><hi rend="italic">Police</hi>.--The less said about the behaviour
of the police the better. The force simply melted away; but as it was
always inefficient its absence had little effect. Save, perhaps, in a
failure to bring up those trivial offences mentioned in the last
para.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303233"><hi rend="italic">Jails</hi>.--The jail was happily preserved
throughout; for the addition of four or five hundred felons to the bad
characters of my district might have complicated matters. I was
peculiarly fortunate in this, since I learn that only nine out of the
forty-three jails in the Province were so held.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303234"><hi rend="italic">Revenue (Sub-head, Land)</hi>.--The arrears under
this head are less than usual, and there seems no reason to apprehend
serious loss to Government.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303235"><hi rend="italic">(Opium)</hi>--There has, I regret to say, been
considerable detriment to our revenue under this head, due to the fact
that the smuggling of the drug is extremely easy, owing to its small
bulk, and that the demand was greater than usual.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303236"><hi rend="italic">(Stamps)</hi>--The revenue here shows an increase
of Rs. 72,000. I am unable to account for this, unless the prevailing
uncertainty made the public mind incline towards what security it
could compass in the matter of bonds, agreements, etc.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303237"><hi rend="italic">(Salt and Customs)</hi>--This department shows a
very creditable record. My subordinates, with the help of a few
volunteers, were able to maintain the Customs line throughout the
whole disturbances. Its value as a preventative of roving lawlessness
cannot be overestimated. Four hundred and eighty-two smugglers were
punished, and the Customs brought in Rs. 33,770 more than in '56. But
the work done by this handful of isolated European patrols--with only
a few natives under them--to the cause of law and order, cannot be
estimated in money.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303238"><hi rend="italic">Education</hi>.--The higher education went on as
usual. Primary instruction suffered. Female schools disappeared
altogether.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303239"><hi rend="italic">Public Works</hi>.--Many things combined to stop
anything like a vigorous prosecution of new public works, and those in
hand were greatly retarded.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303240"><hi rend="italic">Post-Office.</hi>--The work in this department
suffered occasional lapses owing to the murder of solitary runners by
lawless ruffians, but the service continued fairly efficient. An
attempt was made, by the confiscation of sepoys' letters, to discover
if any organised plan of attack or resistance was in circulation, but
nothing incriminatory was found, the correspondence consisting chiefly
of love-letters.</p><pb xml:id="fswater_1303241" n="429 APPENDIX A"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303242"><hi rend="italic">Financial</hi>.--At one time the necessary cash
for the pay of establishtnents ran short, but this was met by bills
upon native bankers, who have since been repaid.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303243"><hi rend="italic">Hospitals</hi>.--The dispensaries were in full
working order throughout the year, and the number of cases
treated--especially for wounds and hurts, many of them grievous--above
the average.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303244"><hi rend="italic">Health and Population</hi>.--Both were normal,

itself. In many cases also, the booty was restored amicably when it
became evident that Government could hold its own.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303245"><hi rend="italic">Agriculture</hi>.--Notwithstanding the violence
of contest, the many instances of plundered and burnt villages, the
necessary impressment of labour and cattle, and the licence of
mutineers consorting with felons, agricultural interests did not
suffer. Ploughing and sowing went on steadily, and the land was well
covered with a full winter crop.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fswater_1303246"><hi rend="italic">General Remarks</hi>.--Beyond these plundered and
burnt villages, which are still somewhat of an eyesore, though they
are recovering themselves rapidly, the only result of the Mutiny to be
observed in my district is that money seems scarcer, and so the
cultivators have to pay a higher rate of interest on loans.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303247">There are, of course, some empty chairs in the district durbar. I
append a list of their late occupants also, and suggest that the
vacancies might be filled from the other list, as some of those
gentlemen who helped to raise the levy have not yet got chairs.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303248">In regard to future punishments, however, I venture to suggest that
orders should be issued limiting the period during which mutineers can
be brought to justice. If some such check on malicious accusation be
not laid down we shall have a fine crop of false cases, perjuries,
etc., since the late disturbances have, naturally, caused a good many
family differences. In view of this also, I believe it would be
safest, in the event of such accusations in the future, to punish the
whole village to which the alleged mutineer belongs, by a heavy fine
rather than to single out individuals as examples. In a case like the
present it is extremely difficult to measure the exact proportion of
guilt attachable to each member of the community, and, even with the
very greatest care, I find it is not always possible to hang the right
man. And this is a difficulty which will increase as time goes
on.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="fswater_1303249" n="430 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/><div xml:id="fswater_0604" n="2" type="appendix"><head>APPENDIX B</head><opener><dateline><name type="place">DELHI,</name><date><hi rend="italic">Christmas

whole years have passed since I helped you to decorate a
Christmas-tree in the Government college here. Those long months
before the walls, and those others of wild chase after vanishing
mutineers over half India seem to belong to some one else's existence
now that I--and the world around me--are back in the commonplaces of
life. I was down to-day helping the chaplain's wife with another
tree--she has a very pretty sister, by the way, just out from
England--and I almost fancied, as I looked into the dim screened
verandah where we are going to have an entertainment, that I could see
you sitting there with little Sonny Seymour on your lap as I found you
that afternoon half asleep when that interminable play about the Lord
of Life and Death (wasn't it?) had been too much for you.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303251">Well, I can only hope that Mr. Douglas's health and the pleasures
of that Scotch home, of which you wrote me such a delightful
description, will allow of your returning to India sometime and giving
me a sight of you again.</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303254">Meanwhile I am reminded that I sent you off a small parcel by last
mail which I trust may arrive before the wedding--as this should
do--and convey to you the kindly remembrances of friends many thousand
miles away. Not that you will need to be reminded. I fancy that few
who went through the Indian Mutiny will ever need to have the faces
and places they saw there recalled to their memory. Terrible as it was
at the time, I myself feel that I would not willingly forget a single
detail. So, being certain that it holds your interest, your
imagination also, I am enclosing something for you to read. Can you
not imagine the Silent and Diffident Dashe writing it? I can, and the
careful way in which he would order the gallows to be removed, and lay
down his sword in favour of his pen at the earliest opportunity. You
see he favours clemency Canning. So do most of us out here except
those who have not yet recovered their nerves. I remember hearing
Hodson--sad, wasn't it? his death over a needless piece of
dare-devilry--very angry over something Mr. Douglas said about our all
being in a blind funk. I am afraid it was true of a good many. Not
Dashe, however; he kept his district together by sheer absence of
fear, and so did many another. This report, then, will carry you on in
the story, as it were, since you left us. As you will see, it is all
over except the shouting; except honours and hanging. Regarding these,
two items may interest you.<pb xml:id="fswater_1303252" n="431 APPENDIX B"/>
Bukt-Khân escaped the latter, escaped even the exile which, as
you know, overtook the King and Queen; but his fate was--if tales be
true--quite satisfactory. He was over-ridden by his own soldiers in a
rout. Concerning honours; when the troopers of the 9th Lancers were
called on for a nominee to receive the V. C. they sent up the name of
the regimental <hi rend="italic">bhistie</hi>. What is more, they
refused to amend their selection on the ground that if he didn't get
it no one else deserved it. So it wasn't given. Government has very
little tact. Have you heard of the British soldier chalking up '<hi rend="italic">Delhi taken and India saved for Rs.</hi> 30/8/6 on the
walls of the palace? That is the amount of <hi rend="italic">batta</hi>; but I think the promised prize-money will be
given eventually. For the rest, there is not much to tell. You
remember our old mess khansaman Mungal Khan? He turned up, <hi rend="italic">with his bill</hi>, and out of pure delight insisted on
feasting us so lavishly that we had to make him moderate his
transports. Even with <hi rend="italic">batta</hi> and prize-money we
should all have been bankrupt, like the Royal Family. I can't help
pitying it. Of course we have pensioned the lot, but I expect precious
little hard cash gets to some of those wretched women. One of them, no
less a person than the princess Farkhoonda Zamâni--that beast
Abool-Bukr's ally--has set up a girls' school in the city. If she had
only befriended you instead of turning you out to find your own fate,
she would have done better for herself. Talking of friends and foes,
it is rather amusing to find the villages full of men busy at their
ploughs with a suspiciously military set about the shoulders, who,
according to their own showing, never wore uniform, or doffed it
before the Mutiny began. I was much struck with one of these
defaulters the other day; a big Rajpoot, who, but for his name, might
have stood for the Laodicean sepoy you told me about. But names can be
changed, so can faces; and that reminds me that I had a petition from
that old scoundrel Tiddu the other day--you know I have been put on to
civil work lately, and shall end, I suppose, by being a Commissioner
as well as a Colonel--he has had a grant of land given him for life,
and he now wants the tenure extended in favour of one Jhungi, who, he
declares, helped you in your marvellous escape. It seems there was
another brother, one Bhungi, who--but I own to being a little confused
in the matter. Perhaps you can set me straight. Meanwhile, I have
pigeon-holed the Jhungi-Bhungi claim until I hear from you. The old
man was well, and asked fervently after Sonny, who, by the way, goes
home from Lucknow in the spring. I expect the Seymours are about the
only family in India which came out of the business unscathed; yet
they were in the thick of it. Truly the whole thing was a mystery from
beginning to end. I asked a native yesterday if he could explain it,
but he only shook his head and said the Lord had sent a 'breath into
the land.' But the most remarkable thing to my mind about the whole
affair is the rapidity with which it proved the stuff a man was made
of. You can see that by looking into the cemeteries. India is a dead
level for the present; all the heads<pb xml:id="fswater_1303253" n="432 ON THE FACE OF THE WATERS"/> that towered above their fellows laid low. Think of them
all! Havelock, Lawrence, Outram--the names crowd to one's lips; but
they seem to begin and end with one--Nicholson!</p><p xml:id="fswater_1303255">Well, good-bye! I have not wished you luck--that goes without
saying; but tell Douglas I'm glad he had his
chance.--</p><closer><salute>Ever yours truly,</salute><signed><name type="person">CHARLES
