collection of sketches now to be offered to the public.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13016">A Preface! What an order! I would as soon write another volume; it
certainly would be the easier task of the twain. It has to be done,
of course; but how, I don't know. I never wrote a Preface in my
life. I have not the least idea how to set about it; though I am in
an utter agony of apprehension, lest defects in this absolute
necessity should 'mull' the effect of the whole.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13017">I have consulted a friend on the subject, who says, 'Pooh! if you
can write a book full of sketches, you can write a Preface'; and he
says it as glibly as if it is nothing more difficult than an
acceptance of a dinner invitation, and can be dashed off at a
moment's notice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13018">I explain to him that a book full of 'sketches' is an easy
matter. I simply take a real soldier out of a real regiment, and give
him somebody else's real name; I put real jokes into his mouth, and
relate real incidents which happened to him or to somebody else. But I
cannot do that with a Preface; where shall I find a Preface a real
life?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13019">My friend assumes a serious aspect, and, leaving the question of
the Preface altogether, remarks, that, in his opinion, I am playing
a dangerous game.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13020">'Supposing,' says he wisely--'supposing any fellow recognises his
own portrait.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13021">I know that 'any fellow' is much more likely to recognise some
'other fellow's' portrait than his own: though, goodness knows, they
are nearly all unvarnished enough for the most obtuse self-blindness
to see clearly through the thin disguise cast over them.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_13022" n="iv"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_13023"><hi rend="italic">Mais revenons é nos
moutons</hi>--otherwise our Preface. I fear all of this is terribly
out of order; yet there are one or two things I should like to say,
whether they are out of order or not.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13024">I wish the sketches to be taken strictly for what they are--<hi rend="italics">portraits from life</hi> of our British-born sons of
Mars. I own frankly that characters and incidents, are, for the most
part, real characters and incidents, slightly shuffled and
embroidered, and that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> have a foundation of
truth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13025">The old letters introduced into 'His Princess' (date 1759-1761)
are simply copies of the originals. I certainly did mend up the
spelling and the punctuation a bit--both were vile; for, finding it
such a nuisance to wade through them myself, I feared my readers
would never trouble to look at them, unless I <hi rend="italic">translated</hi> them into plainer English.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13026">And thus I launch my military children (not quite of fancy) upon
the world; dedicating the portraits to the originals--to all the
gentlemen who have been unconsciously my models--I make my bow, and
sign myself the thereby greatly obliged</p><signed>AUTHOR.</signed></div></front><body xml:id="jwcaval_12032"><pb xml:id="jwcaval_13027" n="[5]"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_011" type="introduction"><head>REGIMENTAL LIFE.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_13028">VERY few people have any conception of how severe a school the Army is. I speak more especially of the mounted branch of the service, because popular writers of fiction are more fond of 'writing up' cavalry officers than any other.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13029">One has grown intimately acquainted with life in the mess-room, as so many authors depict it. One has learned all the names officers are popularly supposed to bestow upon one another. There is always a colonel, old, white-haired, and singularly amiable, who is a sort of protecting father to all his officers, He looks after their love-affairs, of which, by-the-by, in real life, a chief is supposed to remain in blissful ignorance. He sees they are not' put upon ' by their seniors; is frequently spoken to as 'old fellow,' and very often falls in love with the young lady who has gained the affections of one of his ' subs ' of, say, six weeks' standing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13030">Then comes the major—generally a woman-hater, this. Why a major should invariably hold the fair sex in detestation is not often explained; but there the truth is, stern and unvarnished, and the reader has to make the best of it. Sometimes this woman-hater falls in love, and is transformed into a husband of the most exemplary description, but more often he remains in his unpleasant character to the end of the chapter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13031">I wonder, does it never occur to the writer that, in the natural course of events, a man fond of soldiering, who sticks to it, must get promotion? In that case, does the major take up his predecessor's paternal line of action, and was the typical chief a woman-hater also, before he obtained his regiment?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13033">Amongst the captains there are various characters; there is one who
can do anything or everything. He can sing, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_13032" n="6      CAVALRY LIFE"/>hunt, fish, ride; he can win a steeplechase on the veriest screw, by virtue of his brilliant riding; he can shoot, draw, and paint, act, dance, and do everything under the sun with equal perfection. He is one of those whom the gods love, and he does not die young. He is like the princess in the fairy tale, who was fortunate enough to have three fairy godmothers, for every luxury and blessing seems to have been showered down upon him. He is singularly handsome, too—generally of the type which, but for the moustaches, might serve for the face of a young duchess; he has more money than he can spend, which, as he is in a cavalry regiment, must be considerable. He has a wonderful constitution, too, for he can drink all night—brandy-and-sodas, save the mark!—and yet he is up with the lark in the morning, at some innocent and healthy pursuit, which, though you might find occupying a schoolboy, never in this world induced an officer, after a night of unlimited brandy-and-soda, to turn out of his comfortable bed until the very last moment. And the most wonderful of all is that, in spite of these excesses, our hero's eyes never lose their brightness or their clearness; his hand and aim are invariably as steady as a rock.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13034">To finish the list of this gentleman's charms, he is an accomplished flirt; his very name is a terror to mothers and husbands, and yet he usually ends by marrying some insipid unformed child just out of the schoolroom, and, like the married major, settles down into a steadygoing country squire, without a wish or an idea beyond his childish wife, his hunting, and his shorthorns; in fact, he sinks into a state of bucolic stupidity, and altogether forgets the days when he was the boast—very frequently the toast—of 'ours,' and was known far and wide as ' Beauty' so-and-so.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13035">Then there is another captain who smokes. Of him we do not see very much; his life, his thoughts, his conversation, and his character may be summed up in the single word <hi rend="italic">smoke</hi>; and so very properly his existence, for us, is but hazy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13037">The senior subaltern and his duties are utterly ignored; and most
prominent of all these military children of fancy is the young
cornet. He is very young, this wonderful boy, and he has a decided
tendency to go wrong; but everyone pets him and makes much of him, and
he is popularly known as ' Baby ' or ' Prettyface,' sometimes as ' the
Cherub' or ' the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_13036" n="7     REGIMENTAL LIFE"/>Seraph.' For this youth the protecting friendliness of the fatherly colonel comes into play, and it is wonderful how many duties and infringements he is excused. He, like our friend the popular captain, is fair to look upon, being of the duchess type, graceful in bearing and dainty in colouring.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13038">Lastly, we have the regimental surgeon, whom we must one and all own a perfect monstrosity. He is lanky, ugly, ill-dressed, speaks with a strong brogue, or maybe a Tyne-side twang or Northumbrian burr, and altogether excites the curiosity of the reader as to how such a man attained his position.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13039">Sometimes we are admitted into the troop-rooms, and the chief feature we find there is the blind devotion of the men to the officers, or <hi rend="italic">one</hi> officer in particular; not only blind devotion, but passionate admiration and keen interest in all their proceedings.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13040">How very, very different is real life in a barrack! How respectful the 'sir' with which the colonel and the major are addressed! How very different is the behaviour of the junior officers, and how mercilessly severe are the manner and judgments of 'the senior sub'!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13041">The very slightest infringement of regimental rules is visited with an anteroom court-martial; and the punishments awarded are no mere child's play; they are often corporal, and in all cases severe.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13042">In one regiment, which for convenience' sake we will call the Cuirassiers, two subs, lately joined, omitted to rise for early stables, when it was their turn for duty as orderly-officer. The result was, not that these two only were reprimanded, but that the whole of the subalterns were called into the orderly-room, and, to use their own language, were 'jolly well slated.' The two delinquents were not especially mentioned, and thought to hear no more of the matter. Not so. The others simply bided their time until midnight, when, the senior officer having retired, an anteroom court-martial was called, and the defaulters were brought up for trial, and, being convicted, sentenced to punishment. And in what did that punishment consist? Not in a 'slating,' but each was sentenced to receive three strokes of a birch rod from every member of the court-martial; that is, about thirty strokes each, and <hi rend="italic">well laid on!</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13044">As soon as a subaltern joins his regiment, he is submitted <pb xml:id="jwcaval_13043" n="8"/>to a course of practical jokes, ill-treatment, and bullying all round, to which he must offer no resistance, or his career will be a short one. For instance, a few years ago a man named Royd joined this same regiment, and on his first evening amongst his new comrades was 'drawn.' That is to say, he was visited in his room during the small hours of the morning and ordered to go down into the anteroom for court-martial, the charge against him being that he had risen from the dinner-table whilst an officer senior to him remained sitting. Royd, being of huge stature and gigantic strength, stoutly resisted, and eventually picked up the largest man in the room, carried him out on to the landing, and dropped him over the baluster on to the flagged passage below. The effect was magical; in an instant all the hubbub was hushed, and the injured man was raised. Fortunately the result was nothing worse than a sprained ankle and a severely-bruised hip. He took it very quietly, and merely looked up at Royd, who was standing near, and said coolly, 'I'll have you out for this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13045">Very possibly the new-comer did not think much of the threat, but his career was virtually over; at every hour of the day and night did he have cause to repent that hasty action, and during the autumn manœuvres of that year the climax came. It was in this wise: On a pouring wet day, or, rather, night, he had to visit the pickets, and as, for some reason, he had no horse, was compelled to do the rounds on foot. On coming in after a tramp of some miles thoroughly soaked and tired out, he was ordered to visit yet another outlying picket six or seven miles away. Then was his tormentor's opportunity; he would not permit him to take a troop horse, though he himself was riding. Tired, cold, and wet, this young subaltern reached the picket; something went wrong, as did his temper, and he swore at one of the men. His fate was sealed. His senior immediately put him under arrest, and he was told by the colonel that he must send in his papers or undergo trial by court-martial. Of course he left the regiment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13046">A young officer is not even permitted to dress himself as he pleases. It was reported in the anteroom of the Cuirassiers that one of the junior officers had been seen in Piccadilly wearing an Inverness cloak. On his return from town he was ordered by the senior captain to produce the article in question, and it was burnt before his eyes.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_13047" n="9     REGIMENTAL LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_13048">'Whilst you are an officer of the Cuirassiers, sir,' said the senior captain, 'you will dress like a gentleman, and not as if you had bought your clothes out of a slop-shop in Blooms-bury.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13049">Sometimes a newly-joined officer attempts the hail-fellow-well-met style of intercourse with his seniors, but his intentions are nipped in the bud with marvellous celerity. Such an one joined the Cuirassiers during the leave season, and tried his system upon the major.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13050">'Ah, Houghton,' said he, one day after lunch, while several officers, including the major, were standing about the anteroom fire, 'will you go down to the rink with me this afternoon?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13051">The cool audacity of this proposal stopped every tongue in the room, and all listened breathlessly for the major's reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13052">'I don't mind,' he said quietly, much more quietly than they had expected; but probably he wished to see how far this young gentleman's assurance would take him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13053">'Ah, very well. I'll be ready about four o'clock, so come round to my rooms and look me up.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13054">This was a matter for the senior sub's notice, and although he was not in the room at the time, the conversation was quickly reported to him, and he as quickly sent for the delinquent.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13055">'Now, look here, young chap,' he began, ' this sort of thing won't do at all. If the major asks you to go anywhere with him, you will tell him whether you'll go or you won't, but you'll not propose going to the rink or anywhere else with him. And another thing, when you address him you will say "major" or "sir." I am very much astonished that the major did not speak to you himself about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13057">Then life in a barrack is by no means such an existence of ease, luxury, and time-killing as novelists would fain make us believe. Take, for example, the duties of the orderly officer for the day. He must rise at six o'clock for early stables, or the whole of the subalterns suffer in consequence; then he has to go round the breakfasts, see that they are all right, and hear any complaints; then, if it is not a field-day, he must ride with the troops to watering order; he must visit the hospital; then come morning stables, and as likely as not, if he be stationed at Aldershot or Colchester, he will be on court-martial, for which he has all the nuisance of getting into <pb xml:id="jwcaval_13056" n="10     CAVALRY LIFE"/>full dress, and may think himself very lucky if he miss the orderly-room business and the round of the dinners. In the afternoon he must again visit the hospital, and probably there will be a parade; certainly he will have the picket to mount, and as likely as not he will have to walk a mile or so to do it. Then he has the first hour's rest of the day, and at half-past five he must turn out again for afternoon stables and 'teas'; then hospital once more. He does eat his dinner in peace, but he must receive the watch-setting reports and mount the guard ere bedtime. Nor should mention be omitted of the number of times the orderly officer has to sign his name and to change his uniform. If his turn fall upon Sunday, he must accompany the commanding officer around the married quarters, but as some compensation for that he escapes church parade, and so is spared the trouble of getting into full dress—no light matter, more especially in the item of the boots.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13058">The imposition of fines is another method of punishing infringements of regimental rules. If an officer is not properly shaven, if he puts on any part of his uniform wrongly, he must pay for the champagne drunk at dinner that evening. This fine is also enforced for swearing or using bad language in the presence of the chaplain or any senior officer, and also for dropping the sword. On certain occasions an officer must pay when it is not a case of fining. If he gets promotion, if he brings home the regiment from the drill field for the first time as commanding officer, if he wins a race, or is going to be married, at all such times he has to 'stand ' champagne.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13059">Our novelists do well to give their military heroes an inexhaustible rent-roll. There are very few such out of the Guards, and soldier servants have to be very well up in methods of getting rid of duns and such other unwelcome visitors as their masters do not care to be at home to.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13061">Another terrible mistake made by novelists is the magnificence with which they surround their heroes in quarters. If such could but once peep into the room (for an officer has seldom but one room, even if he is no longer a subaltern, excepting at Colchester, where each cavalry officer has a room about twelve feet by fourteen, and a tiny dressing-room, just half that size) of any ordinary hussar, dragoon or lancer, he or she—I suspect it is most often the women who are so fond of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_13060" n="11     REGIMENTAL LIFE"/>soldier heroes—would never again depict him in rooms resembling a very fine lady's boudoir. Oh, the patched walls, the bare paint, the marks on the door where the lock gave way the last time the owner was 'drawn' by his comrades, the blackened ceiling, the almost invariable absence of window-blinds, the miserable regulation fender fastened to the floor, the more miserable regulation coal-scuttle, and, most miserable of all, the regulation barrack chairs! It is all so wonderfully unlike the barrack-room of fiction. There is the very rickety crib of a bed, made to take in pieces upon occasion, and which by daytime the servant, with the aid of cretonne covers for the pillows and a fur carriage rug, converts into a sofa; and there is the dressing-table, likewise hung all round with cretonne, and which strikes one as being remarkably high for its purpose. Just pull the cretonne curtain a little, and half the front will open, showing you that it is but a make-believe table after all, and, stripped of its hangings, would stand forth a packing-case! Well, it is both a toilette-table and a wardrobe now, for piled upon the shelves, which have been put in temporarily, are the various suits of clothes belonging to the owner of the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13063">Then over there, on the other side of the room, is the inevitable chest of drawers, which, when travelling, just fit nicely inside the dressing-table. They are exactly like the drawers in every room in the barracks, are of mahogany, have brass handles, and a despatch-box and writing-desk combined in the middle drawer at the top. Then the lid of our friend's bath, being fitted with three legs which screw in and out at pleasure, makes a very convenient writing-table if covered with a cloth, and into the bath itself, for travelling, the legs go, together with the tripod, washing-stand, and the tin basin and ewer. Some officers have pianos, but they are always hired, and most officers have a few pictures and little trifles to scatter about their room. For instance, a couple of fur rugs thrown across the huge barrack armchairs take off from their ugliness much, mid if a soldier is fortunate enough to know a lady who will work him a cover for his cot, his room will look much more presentable. And yet at best a soldier's room is but a 'shake-down,' and if he be rich or poor, he seldom attempts to make it otherwise. The handsomest room I ever saw in barracks was that of a captain of dragoons; in fact, he had been fortunate enough to secure two large rooms, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_13062" n="12     CAVALRY LIFE"/>those which, if he had required them, would have been allotted to the major. This man was very rich, and had certainly taken a good deal of trouble to make his rooms habitable, and yet—well, they were only barrack-rooms. There were the usual make-shifts, and when the fur rug slipped off the great easy-chair in which I sat, I saw the broad straps which served for arms, and which told me it was just the same as I had seen in barrack-rooms so many times before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13064">The rooms of a well-known colonel of cavalry, a man who now possesses a title and thirty thousand a year, were simply beggarly, not nearly so handsome as was the one little room of his vet, of which I had just a glimpse. And why? Because one room was the man's hobby; the other was not.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13065">One more word and I have done; it concerns the fancy names bestowed upon soldiers in novels. They are all fancy names, and in real life do not exist. In no case have I ever known a name given in recognition of a man's personal comeliness, such as Cherub, Beauty, Adonis, Apollo, Pretty-face, and the like. One of the handsomest men I ever knew was commonly known as The Spider. Why, I cannot tell ߞ not because he was like one. In closing, I will give a few names I have actually known: The Infant (weighing twenty-one stone), The Cob, David, The Winter Apple, King Kobo, Old Muzzie, The Spider, Landy-fandy-Widden, Sprouts, Bole,The Admiral, Paddy K——, Tin Whistle, Illigant John of Bath, The Lady-killer, Mother Hubbard, Billy Buttons, Piggie, Alphabet. Most frequently men's own names are abbreviated; thus, at one time in a distinguished lancer regiment there were any amount of Bills and Billys. In another of hussars, the name of David prevailed; nearly all were Davids, even a race-horse belonging to one of the officers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13066">When the personal appearance of an officer is not prepossessing, a name is quickly found for him. Any remark on the subject of 'looks' meets with a rejoinder sharp and to the point. Said one Cuirassier to another:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13067">'Why, your nose is so stuck up, one might hang one's hat on it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13068">'Well, my dear chap,' was the ready reply, 'one certainly couldn't on yours.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13069">And it was true enough.</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_13070" n="13     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_012" n="1" type="story"><head>A REGIMENTAL MARTYR;<lb/>OR HOW GERARD ST.

As he turned the handle of the door, a fragment of the conversation within fell upon his ear—</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13073">
'<hi rend="italic">Make hay in St. Hilary's room to-night</hi>.'
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13074">'The deuce!' ejaculated that young gentleman.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13075">'Sentry-box him first,' cried a voice, which he recognised as Captain Gurney's, a man well up the list of captains, who was old enough to have known better; 'and if that doesn't fetch him, hammer the door in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13076">'Ha, ha, ha!' laughed a chorus of voices, under cover of which the intended victim beat a retreat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13077">'Sentry-box me! Ah, thank you, Captain Gurney!' he exclaimed when he had reached the shelter of his own room; 'forewarned is forearmed, and I'm on my guard this time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13078">Hastily changing his undress for mufti, Mr. St. Hilary made the best of his way out of barracks, going in the direction of Milchester.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13079">The regiment of which he was butt-in-chief for practical jokes was the 52nd Dragoons of famous Peninsular memory. Perhaps his unfailing good temper made him more subject to this form of wit than would have been the case if he had borne malice and sulked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13080">An outsider would, perhaps, say, Why did not he report the offenders, and so secure peace? But anyone with the least knowledge of regimental life could answer that for a subaltern to adopt such a course would simply be to limit his career in the army to a very short period. Of course, during the process he blustered a good deal, and frequently threatened to tell the chief all about it the very first thing in the morning; but, fortunately for his brother officers, Gerard St. Hilary had a peculiarity. After 2 a.m. he could not keep his eyes open, and was glad to make any bargain that would leave him in peace.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_13081" n="14     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_13082">It was invariably the same: Lieutenant St. Hilary, lightly clad, as likely as not soaked with water, standing in the centre of a group of excited comrades in mess-dress, expressing his determination 'to have no more of this foolery, by Jove!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13083">'Go it, Jerry! pile it up, my boy!' one would cry, amidst the jeers of the bystanders.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13084">'I'm surprised at you, D'Albert!' poor Jerry would cry in disgust. 'I'll report you in the morning, upon my soul I will! though you are a captain.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13085">Small heed did the 52nd take of these awful threats. Was not the end unchanging? Presently St. Hilary would begin to shiver, then Sleep would come dropping her grains of sand into Gerard's blue eyes, and his comrades knew that then was their time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13086">'Now, Jerry, old man, if you forgive us, you shall go to bed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13087">'Well, let me be quiet,' was poor Jerry's answer (it was always the same), 'and I'll say no more about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13088">The gratitude of the rioters was generally shown on these occasions by the careful way in which they tucked Gerard up in bed and reduced his room to something like order. Alas! only something. Order generally took days and a visit to the upholsterers to effect, with much groaning from Jerry's man on the subject of what he called 'them idjiots.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13089">Poor Gerard had undergone every possible form of practical joking, and he was become a little tired of it; the trodden worm will turn, and he was thoroughly determined to put a stop to it once for all, though it must be owned he didn't quite know how to set about it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13090">However, enough on that head. I will just explain what is meant by ' sentry-boxing 'and' making hay,' and then go on with my story.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13091">The doors of an officer's rooms are usually made of strong material, the hammering in of which is a long process; in order, therefore, to draw the victim from his lair, without his suspecting mischief, they knock at his door and tell him the colonel or the major wants him at once, or cry 'Fire!' at the other end of the corridor. If this succeeds, well and good; but on gala nights the sentry-box is brought into play. It is placed close against the victim's door, after the manner of a trap, so that when he comes out he may go crash against the back of the box. I need not add that the more bruised and angry he is the better pleased his comrades are.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_13092" n="15     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_13093">Making hay is simply breaking or turning topsy-turvy everything the intruders can lay their hands upon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13094">The cavalry barracks at Milchester are about a mile from the town, which is a cathedral city, chiefly noted for the beauty of its young ladies and the good tone of its society.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13095">In common with most cathedral towns, Milchester was just a little dull. In summer the Botanical Gardens, and in winter the Winter Palace, were the principal places of amusement. To the latter Mr. St. Hilary made his way, it being, when my story opens, the dreary month of November. It was an 'off' day. Had the bonny dappled hounds been after their little red-coated friend, Captain Gurney would probably have come in too tired and stiff to think of anything beyond his dinner and his bed; but there was no meet that day, and thus we have a striking instance of what Satan finds for idle hands, which is not, I trust, too severe a reflection on the gentlemen of Her Majesty's army.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13096">It was three o'clock; the Palace was full, and a crowd of well-dressed people were promenading to the strains of 'Geleibt und Verloren' waltz.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13097">Gerard passed in with all speed, and quickly made his way up and down the gay throng, as though seeking for some particular individual. He was evidently a great favourite with the fair sex, for wherever he went he was greeted with smiles and other little pleasantries. Tall, short, fair, or dark, all seemed equally pleased to see him. There were girls in blue and girls in green, in sealskin and sable, in spoon bonnets and pork-pie hats; and for each and all he had a bright word or compliment, but he lingered with none.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13098">He did not find the object of his search very readily, for he was a trifle short-sighted, and, as I know from experience, the wearing of an eyeglass confines one's sight to the space immediately in front.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_13099">At last his patience was rewarded; walking slowly with several gentlemen came a young lady, who attracted the attention and admiration of all. She was not very tall, rather under than over the middle height, with a graceful figure and carriage, delicate little hands and feet, and a small mignon face, of which the nose was just a wee bit up-turned, and the eyes were brilliant gleaming hazel. Her hair, which was extremely abundant, was twisted round her small shapely head in massive coils, and was of the deepest auburn hue.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130100" n="16     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130101">She was dressed in a tight-fitting costume of prune-coloured serge, and her hat was of the same material. Her waist and throat were clasped by a heavy silver belt and a necklet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130102">The name of this young lady was Elinor Warwick. Her father held the appointment of deputy-assistant commissary-general. She lived on the same side of the town as the barracks were situated, and was, as was natural from her father's position, on very intimate terms with both the cavalry and infantry officers stationed in Milchester.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130103">The preference was, however, given to the former, and Mr. St. Hilary enjoyed the distinction of being Miss Warwick's slave-in-chief. Poor Gerard! slave-in-chief and butt-in-chief. Not an enviable fate; but the former office he would not have delegated for any consideration, while words will not express Mr. St. Hilary's feelings on the subject of the latter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130104">It was a remarkable fact that, although ladies never could see anything in Miss Warwick, 'a little pert, snub-nosed thing,' she always had three or four men 'in tow.' On that afternoon she had a cavalier on either side, while one or two others made up the rear. As she said herself, 'The clumsy fellows could never get out of the way; it was just like walking with outriders.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130105">Gerard went up, his blue eyes ablaze, and sauntered alongside of her for some distance, to the intense disgust of the man he had supplanted. Miss Elinor had, however, no intention of allowing him to remain there. Her way of showing him favour was by ill-using him, yet giving him certain small liberties which she did not accord to the men she took the most pains to please. One man would say to another when she was ordering Gerard about: 'I would not stand that; what a big duffer the fellow is!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130106">But Gerard would not have exchanged the sweet familiarity of his intercourse with Elinor for all the civil speeches in the world—in fact, it was a case of 'Betty know'd her man.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130107">'You're coming to our ball, Miss Warwick?' asked he.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130108">'Oh yes, of course!' she answered, in a quick clear voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130109">'How many am I to have?'—pleadingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130110">'I really don't know. How many do you want?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130111">'Every one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130112">' Well, but you can't have them. I'll give you one quadrille if you like—the third.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130113">'And four waltzes besides?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130114" n="17     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130115">'No'—very decisively. 'I'll give you three, if you will make yourself generally useful and agreeable this afternoon—do your duty like a man, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130116">'May I walk home with you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130117">'Well—yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130118">'I won't do it for three,' announced he, leaning forward with a dangerous look in his blue eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130119">'Four, then,' said Elinor, in rather a frightened tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130120">'<hi rend="italic">And</hi> supper?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130121">'Now, Mr. St. Hilary, you're asking too much. It's not in season.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130122">'And supper,' repeated our hero firmly, 'or I'll not stir an inch.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130123">'Well, go away!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130124">Away he went, having learned a soldier's first lesson thoroughly. He managed to keep Miss Warwick in sight, and when she disappeared from the gay throng he followed in time to help her into a huge fawn-coloured paletot, which, as the inhabitants of Milchester remarked, 'no one but Miss Warwick would have the courage to wear.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130125">As the two walked home together through the dreary November fog, Elinor became aware that something was amiss with her companion. More than once he sighed dolefully, and was altogether so different from the Gerard St. Hilary whose jolly laugh was heard every two minutes that she was completely puzzled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130126">'Whatever is the matter, Mr. St. Hilary?' she said at last.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130127">'Oh,' moaned Gerard, with another long sigh, 'I've got such a dose before me to-night!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130128">'A dose?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130129">'Yes; the fellows are going to make hay in my room tonight.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130130">'Make hay?' repeated Elinor, in a tone of real surprise. 'What, in November?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130131">Then Gerard told her what he had heard, and described the process.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130132">'I assure you, Miss Warwick,' he said, shaking his head solemnly, 'that by this time to-morrow everything in my room will be smashed to bits.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130133">'What a shame!' cried Elinor warmly. 'If I were you I'd try——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130134">'What?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130135" n="18     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130136">She reached up to her companion's ear, and whispered a few words to him; he burst into a roar of laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130137">'By Jove! what a brick you are!' he cried, forgetting his manners. 'I never heard such a splendid idea in my life. Gad, what a clever girl you must be!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130138">'It's quite original,' she responded saucily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130139">'It's absolutely perfect,' replied Gerard, 'and worthy of you in every way. How they will hop to-night!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130140">Elinor's musical treble joined his deeper laugh; and as she parted from him at the gate of her father's house, she turned! back, and said impressively:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130141">'Mind it's white, and don't stint the quantity.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130142">'All right,' answered Gerard; 'I'll get plenty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130143">He did not go into the barracks, but walked past them straight into Milchester, meeting on his way several of the officers returning to dinner. He evaded all their inquiries and offers to go back with him, and went on his way alone. He stopped at the first tinner's shop he came to, and purchased the largest flour-dredger they had. This he took with him, in spite of the shopman's entreaties to be allowed to send it. He next went to a general dealer's, and made another purchase, which he put into his pocket with much care, and as though he were very much afraid the paper might burst. What could it be?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130144">Lieutenant St. Hilary went to mess that night with a face as innocent as that of a little child.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130145">'Well, Jerry, my boy,' quoth Captain Gurney, 'what have you been doing to-day?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130146">Gerard looked at his superior sideways. He would have known what this display of affectionate interest meant without any previous warning.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130147">'Palace,' answered he, with laconic laziness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130148">'Was the lovely Elinor there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130149">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130150">'Did you see her home?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130151">'Of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130152">'Have tea there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130154">'No; I had some shopping to do'—with a little grin at the remembrance of that same shopping; 'I'm downright done up. Trailing up and down that Palace is fifty times harder work than hunting. I shall turn in early to-night, to be fit for to-morrow'—with another small grin at the look of intelli-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_130153" n="19     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/>gence which passed round the room. 'Are any of you fellows going to the theatre to-night? They're having "The Rivals."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130155">'Yes,' answered Gurney; 'but I can't go. I've promised to go in and see old Patterson to-night; so I'm on duty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130156">'On duty,' thought Gerard—'on duty with a sentry-box.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130157">After this the conversation was on general topics; and soon after eleven o'clock Gerard, with many yawns, departed, ostensibly to bed. To that haven of rest, however, he did not to, but, piling up his fire, threw himself into an easy chair, and quietly bided his time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130158">He had not long to wait, for presently he heard the sound of men treading lightly in their stockings. Thereupon he carefully snored, so as to make them believe he was safe in the arms of Morpheus.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130159">'He's fast asleep,' he heard Middleton say.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130160">'Then fetch it, and be quick,' was the answer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130161">As noiselessly as possible the heavy sentry-box was brought up and placed against his door. Then the officers, retreating, went laughing, and with much joking and bear-fighting, to their different rooms, shutting the doors with good hearty bangs, which seemed to indicate retirement for the night.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130162">In a few moments a sharp knocking began at Gerard's door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130163">'Hallo!' bawled he, in a sleepy voice; 'who's there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130164">'Please, sir, the Colonel wants you at once. There's something wrong with B troop, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130165">B troop was Gerard's.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130166">'Tell the Colonel to go and be hanged!' was Gerard's unceremonious answer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130167">'I daren't, sir,' was the reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130168">'You daren't? Then go and be hanged yourself! This fish don't bite!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130169">'He twigs it!' shouted Middleton. 'Come out, you beggar, or we'll stove the door in!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130170">'Stove away, old man!' laughed Gerard, rising, and taking his flour-dredger to within a yard of the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130171">'Come on!' yelled Gurney's voice. 'Yeave ho! push with a will, boys; nothing like haymaking!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130172">Gerard waited till they were all exerting their strength to uttermost, then flung open the door, showering the contents of the flour-dredger upon them as they tumbled headlong into the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130173">'Ah!' (sneeze).</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130174" n="20     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130175">'Ugh!' (sneeze).</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130176">'Brute!' (sneeze, sneeze).</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130177">'I'll pay you out for this!' gasped Gurney, shaking his fist at Gerard, while the tears ran down his face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130178">'Will you?' laughed Gerard, sending another shower full into his face; 'then take that, and that, and that, and make hay elsewhere, confound you! I'm about sick of this game;' as he spoke keeping up a continual shower upon the intruders.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130179">Raving, swearing, spitting, sneezing, choking, and stamping, the crestfallen officers made the best of their way down the corridor in all the ignominy of utter defeat. From head to feet they were covered with the strongest white pepper, the embroidery on their mess-jackets forming grand receptacles for the frightful powder. Their hair, eyes, noses, mouths, and moustaches were all filled with it, and it was hours before the terrible sneezing and choking subsided. So thoroughly was it scattered over each practical joker that for several days the opening of a door or window would send a fresh waft of it across the anteroom or dinner-table, to the intense disgust of the more peaceably-disposed members, who were loud in their demands that for the future St. Hilary should be left in peace.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130180">In peace, however, Gerard St. Hilary was not allowed to remain. On making his appearance in the mess-room on the morning following the <hi rend="italic">feu du poivre</hi>, he was greeted with a volley of forage-caps, newspapers, and other small missiles of a similar character.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130181">He came into the room with a jolly laugh, his blue eyed shining with merriment, and looking, in his well-got-up hunting costume, as he always did look, 'thoroughbred.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130182">'Expect a good run this morning, Gurney?' he began, as he sat down, 'or is your cold too bad?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130183">'My cold?' said that gentleman interrogatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130184">'Yes. I heard a good deal of sneezing in my vicinity last night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130185">'Ah, you rascal!' cried Gurney, laughing in spite of himself; 'we are going to pay you out for that fine trick.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130186">'By Jove, how you did sneeze!' cried Gerard with shrieks of laughter. 'This was it, major: "Ugh!" (sneeze); "Ah!" (sneeze); "Brute!" (choke); "I'll pay you out for this!" (sneeze, choke, choke, sneeze.) Gad, it was fine!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130187">'Serve them right!' growled the Major; 'they'll let you alone now, St. Hilary.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130188" n="21     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130189">'Will we!' cried a chorus of voices; 'don't flatter yourself, Jerry.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130190">At this moment another officer in 'pink' entered the room, and seated himself next to St. Hilary.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130191">''Pon my soul, Jerry,' he began, 'but that was a scurvy trick you played us last night. I can't get your confounded pepper out of my moustaches.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130192">'That's awkward for you, Jack,' laughed Gerard. 'It's my idea that when fellows get engaged to be married they should leave their neighbours in peace.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130193">'Perhaps you're right,' answered Jack Hilton. 'Anyhow, I left my man cursing you after the fashion of Rheims; but, unlike the little jackdaw, you seem to flourish under it amazingly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130194">'I had an uncommonly good night; and you'd better tell your man that "curses, like chickens, come home to roost."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130195">'I think his come home to him with every shake of my clothes or movement of his brush,' cried Hilton, laughing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130196">'Ha, ha, ha!' screamed Gerard in high glee. 'Well, I must be off. Are you coming, Jack?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130197">At the door he turned back to fire a parting shot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130198">'I hope on my return, my dear fellows, to find that the influenza is somewhat improved.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130199">'You were a big fool, too, Jerry,' said Jack Hilton gravely, as the two rode through the soft November fog. 'I never saw any fellow in such a rage as Gurney was in last night—never in all my life. He swore he would be revenged on you; take my word for it he will. They're going to fill your bed with beetles to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130200">'That's pleasant,' said Gerard grimly. 'However, you are a good fellow to tell me. And now let us talk of something else; what's done cannot be undone, and I suppose I must grin and bear it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130201">They found the meet that day but very poorly attended, There was only one lady present. Of course that one was Elinor Warwick.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130202">'Well,' she inquired eagerly, as Gerard rode up, 'how did it answer?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130203">'Oh, if you'd only been there!' cried Gerard, giving her a graphic description of the stampede, but ending with, 'I hear from Hilton that I am to suffer a perfect martyrdom of retaliation.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130204" n="22     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130205">'Poor thing!' said Elinor softly; whereupon Gerard forgot all his troubles, and only remembered that, whatever happened, he would be sure of Elinor's loving pity and commiseration.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130206">The word which he had used to Elinor Warwick in jest was realized by him in all its stern hideousness. A martyr he in very truth became. It seemed as if his tormentors could neither forget nor forgive the <hi rend="italic">feu du poivre</hi>. They no longer dared disturb him at night—their fear of his pepper-pot was too wholesome, but by every other means in their power did they worry and annoy him. His bed was, as Jack Hilton had predicted, filled with cockroaches; and this course was followed up by frogs, dead mice, fender and fire-irons, plentiful administration of lard and wet sponges. His boots were filled with burrs or cobbler's wax, and, in fact, his life was made a burden to him. On the day of the ball, however, matters came to a climax.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_014" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130207">IT was a fortnight after the <hi rend="italic">feu du poivre</hi>. The officers had tried their best to get Gerard made 'orderly' on that day, but failed, and while he was down at the Palace with Miss Warwick they set their wits to work to devise some new form of torture. They went to the Colonel and asked as a great favour that dressing for mess might be excused, on the plea that it would be a great nuisance to dress twice, and their full dress was very inconvenient to dine in on account of the heat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130208">'You see, Colonel,' said they, 'we shall be obliged to dance all night, and we want to begin as cool as possible.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130209">With a slight demur the Colonel consented, and then they knew that their trick was safe.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130210">Gerard went in rather late, and, on hearing that dressing was excused, sat down to dinner without going near his room. At nine o'clock one of the mess waiters came behind his chair and whispered that his man wanted him at once.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130211">From the sudden 'hush' in the room, poor Gerard suspected mischief. His man was awaiting him at the door with an anxious face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130212">'What's the matter?' demanded Gerard.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130213">'Oh, sir!' exclaimed he, 'I hardly dare tell you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130215">Gerard dashed up to his room, and there on the bed lay his<pb xml:id="jwcaval_130214" n="23     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/>tunics and mess jackets, with every seam neatly ripped up. Going to the ball was out of the question; etiquette would not permit him to go in ordinary evening attire.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130216">'Don't look like that, sir,' said Jones in an imploring tone—for Gerard had never uttered one word, but stood gazing on the wreck of his property, growing whiter and whiter every moment—'don't look like that; I've sent for the master tailor. I should think he will be able to get them sewn up in something like time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130217">In a few minutes that functionary arrived, but could not promise that the work should be complete before midnight. For three weary hours did Gerard pace his room, giving no answer to the various knocks from the men who wanted to know how their trick had succeeded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130218">Soon after midnight Gerard was in a cab, driving as fast as possible to the assembly-rooms, where the ball was given. Colonel Lifford, with whom he was a great favourite, was standing near the door when he passed in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130219">'Well, my boy,' he said kindly, 'you are very late.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130220">'Yes, sir, I am rather,' answered Gerard, his voice shaking still.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130221">'Why, what's the matter, St. Hilary?—you are very white. Are you not well?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130222">'Yes, thanks, Colonel;' and Gerard passed on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130223">Now, Gerard was engaged to Miss Warwick for the first, fifth, tenth, and sixteenth dances. The tenth, he very well knew, was the supper waltz. He found that the ninth was then being danced; so, after all, though he had missed two dances with her, he was not so very badly off.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130224">He hung about looking for her, and at last saw her bright chestnut hair in very close proximity to Captain Gurney's scarlet-clad shoulder. Gerard's blue eyes flashed at the sight, for Gurney was not a favourite of Elinor's; yet here she was sitting in an out-of-the-way corner, flirting desperately with the man who had done his best to prevent his coming to the ball.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130226">He waited impatiently for the dance to end, that he might claim Miss Warwick for the waltz, and meanwhile amused himself by studying her face and dress, which was of white silk, unrelieved by any colour. Her hair was plaited in a long braid and hung far below her waist; and nestling in it were two white roses, placed just at the top of the braid behind the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130225" n="24     CAVALRY LIFE"/>left ear. She wore no ornaments whatever, and the only speck of colour she had about her was a large bouquet of crimson and white flowers which Gerard had sent her. His foolish heart throbbed at the sight of it; but it sank to zero when she raised her face, and he saw that it was as white as her dress, and that she had, what he had never seen there before, a hard glittering look in her gleaming hazel eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130227">At last the dance was ended, and the instant the signal sounded for the next one Gerard crossed the room, and, bending his arm to Elinor, said:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130228">'My dance, I believe.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130229">'I have given your dance away,' said Miss Warwick coolly. 'I sat out the two best waltzes of the evening waiting for you, and you really must forgive me if I did not care to waste any more. 'And taking Captain Gurney's arm, she swept away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130230">Gerard was thunderstruck. He stood for a moment speechless with rage and astonishment. This was a catastrophe he had never bargained for. No, poor fellow! He had expected to receive at Elinor's hands sweetest pity and commiseration. He determined not to leave the room without an attempt at an explanation; so he followed them, and began gently:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130231">'Will you not let me explain?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130232">But Elinor was too thoroughly angry to listen to reason, and she faced him haughtily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130233">'Thank you, Mr. St. Hilary, that is quite unnecessary. I assure you, it is not of the slightest consequence.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130234">With a frigid little bow she passed away, leaving Gerard with anything but a pleasant expression on his usually pleasant face. He stood and watched them go down the room; he saw Captain Gurney bend towards her, as though he were saying something especially tender; and the sight of that, and the sound of the light laugh with which Elinor answered it, were more than he could bear. He rushed out of the room, and, entering the first cab, ordered the man to drive as quickly as possible back to barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130235">'Tell you what, George,' said one of his tormentors to another, 'I wish I was well out of this joke: that fellow will go mad.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130236">'Umph! Gurney is such a beggar for running an idea to death.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130238">Gerard reached his room in a state of misery too intense for words. He felt sick and dizzy, and was thankful that for once <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130237" n="25     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/>his bed had been left in decent order. Sleep, however, he could not. He tossed about to and fro; his bed was hot and uncomfortable; and first one and then another of his comrades disturbed him by coming along the corridor with clanking of spurred boots.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130239">At last he sank into a troubled fretful doze, which lasted until Jones came to wake him at six o'clock, for he was orderly officer that day. When the candles were lighted, what Gerard in his agony called the 'fiendishness of the plot' was revealed: from head to foot he was as white as any miller.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130240">His man begged him not to have his usual bath, but be rubbed down with coarse towels as quickly as possible.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130241">'If you get into water, sir, 'he entreated, 'it will all turn to paste. I'll rub it off in a few minutes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130242">'You'll have to be uncommonly quick,' said St. Hilary grimly; 'for I must be out in ten minutes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130243">Jones rubbed and scrubbed with a will, until Gerard was quite clean and presentable, except on one point. That point showed itself with painful obtrusiveness: it was his hair. That and his particularly long yellow moustache were as white as the driven snow. Jones got a couple of big brushes, and worked hard; but though a tremendous cloud of the treacherous white powder came off, no perceptible difference was made in Lieutenant St. Hilary's appearance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130244">'I don't know what to do, sir,' said he at length, with a great sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130245">At this moment a knock was heard at the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130246">'Come in,' roared Gerard.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130247">'Stables, sir,' announced an orderly; 'the Adjutant's out, sir,
already.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130248">This was the last ounce on the camel's back.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130249">'Good heavens!' gasped Gerard. 'Ask him to come up here.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130250">Presently the Adjutant came up, amazed at the unusual request.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130251">'Just look here, Harrington,' said Gerard, displaying his whitened hair;' see what those brutes have done. I can't come into sight like this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130252">'Certainly not,' answered he promptly. 'I'll tell Hilton to do your duty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130254">'And I say, Harrington, don't peach, there's a good chap.' But Harrington, 'a gentleman adjutant,' was a married man, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130253" n="26     CAVALRY LIFE"/>and did not approve of the pranks which were carried to such excess amongst the officers of the 52nd Dragoons. So he departed without vouchsafing any reply to Gerard's continued entreaties.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130255">He breakfasted alone, and soon after ten o'clock the Colonel sent for him to the orderly room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130256">'What's the meaning of this, St. Hilary?' began the chief sternly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130257">'I couldn't go on duty like this, sir', said poor Gerard deprecatingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130258">'What in the world——' began the Colonel, suddenly breaking off into roars of laughter, as his eyes fell upon Gerard in all the freshness of a hoary old age. Then, recovering himself, he said stiffly, 'This should have been reported to me at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130259">'Please, sir,' said Gerard, ' I've been trying to get it out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130260">Again the Colonel was afflicted with a sudden convulsive choking, something between a cough and a sneeze.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130261">'Well, you had better report it now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130262">'I don't know who did it, sir,' was the reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130263">'My good fellow,' said his chief, 'I admire your principles immensely; but you don't expect me to believe that you could be covered with flour from head to foot without knowing who did it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130264">'Yes, sir,' answered Gerard, laughing, 'for they filled my bed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130265">'With flour?' said the Colonel incredulously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130266">'I don't think it is flour, Colonel; it's scented, and I think it's complexion stuff, and that, you know, is made to stick on.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130267">'Umph! Well, you are excused duty to-day; go away.' And Gerard went.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130268">After another brushing by Jones he went to luncheon with as unconcerned a face as he could put on, and for a few moments no one took any notice of him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130269">Presently, however, Captain Gurney left his seat, and, coming behind him, took a leisurely survey of his still whitened locks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130270">'What have you been doing with yourself, my boy? Have you been
acting in private theatricals, or are you going to a <hi rend="italic">bal masqué</hi> at the Palace to-night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130271">Gerard answered never a word; and with another attempt at chaff, Captain Gurney retired to his seat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130273">'I should advise you to let that fellow alone, Gurney,' said <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130272" n="27     REGIMENTAL MARTYR"/>the Surgeon-Major, next to whom he was sitting; 'the chiefs awfully keen about it, and St. Hilary had some difficulty to prevent peaching.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130274">'Oh, Jerry 'd never peach,' said he carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130275">'I don't know; but apart from that, you are knocking the poor lad's health up.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130276">'The poor lad's four-and-twenty,' laughed Gurney, with a sneer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130277">'He cannot stand having his rest broken, and you must stop it.' said the Surgeon decisively. 'If anything more of this kind occurs, I shall report it immediately. I won't stand by and see any fellow's health tampered with, and this persecution has gone on beyond all bounds.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130278">Gerard St. Hilary sat throughout the meal in dignified silence, and presently his dogcart with his high-stepping roan mare was brought round, and he drove away in the direction of Colonel Warwick's house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130279">The young lady's anger had cooled down during the night, and she was repenting very bitterly her unkindness of the previous evening. She told herself that she ought to have listened to his excuses. If, as Captain Gurney had hinted, he had purposely avoided dancing the two first dances with her, why had he come for the supper waltz of all others? He would never ask her to make friends again, and she had thrown away her life's happiness at the instigation of a man she thoroughly disliked and despised. Poor Elinor! She did not realize, till she thought she had lost him, how very dear the yellow-haired, blue-eyed dragoon had grown to her!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130280">She sat alone in her pretty drawing-room—alas that she had no mother to share it with her!—and wondered, with a dull aching at her heart, whether all those happy days were past and gone, never to return.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130281">She heard a carriage drive up to the door, but so little did she expect Gerard that, when he was ushered into the room, she uttered a low cry of surprise and joy, and went with outstretched hands to greet him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130282">'So you have forgiven me?' said Gerard, forgetting all his sorrows at the sight of her tender hazel eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130283">Elinor hung her head, the painful blushes coming thick and fast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130284">'I was very rude last night, and unkind, but I thought——' she stammered.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130285" n="28     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130286">'You thought what?' said Gerard eagerly</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130287">'I—I thought you did not care to dance so many times with me, for Captain Gurney said you were lounging about your rooms doing nothing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130288">'Curse him!' muttered Gerard under his breath. 'So you thought I had forgotten you, did you, darling? And if I had, would you have minded much?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130289">Elinor did not speak; and, strange to say, Gerard did not notice the omission, for he established her in a low chair in front of the blazing fire, and, bending over her, said in a dangerously gentle voice:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130290">'My child, you were very cruel to me last night; nothing else than the cause which kept me away could have held me from your side.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130291">Then he told her all his troubles, and showed her his still whitened hair, which in her agitation she had not noticed. Poor Elinor was in an agony of confusion and regret.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130292">'Can you ever forgive me?' she murmured.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130293">'Yes, my love, on one condition—that, as a penance for your sins, you give me your darling self.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130294">'That will be a curious penance,' said Elinor, looking upwards lovingly. 'No penance at all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130295">'Don't be too sure. I shall be horribly jealous, and exacting to a degree. I shall not allow any flirting, and shall probably make your life a burden to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130296">'I shall not want to flirt,' whispered Elinor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130297">'Won't you, my darling? Will your great, stupid, lumbering husband content you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130298">Elinor thought he would—she thinks so still.</p><milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130299">Amongst the regimental plate of the 52nd is a large golden pepper-pot, encrusted with jewels, and the date engraved thereon is that of Gerard St. Hilary's wedding. It was given by Elinor's wish in remembrance of the regimental martyrdom which had gained for her the truest heart that ever beat, though her husband frequently assures her that he had made up his mind ages before, so that it only hastened matters by a few weeks.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130300" n="29     REGIMENTAL VALENTINE"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_020" n="2" type="story"><head>A REGIMENTAL VALENTINE; OR, HOW PATRICK O'SHAUGHNASSY WAS HELPED INTO

B-y Jove! I should think I did run, as hard as ever I could lay legs to ground!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130302">'What made you so late, Pat?' inquired George de Lyle, the 'senior sub,' next to whom he sat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130303">'Up at the Colonel's. Mrs. Lifford had a lot of girls in to tea, and I couldn't get away,' he answered. 'Just had seven minutes to get here and dress in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130304">'Sharp thing, that! Why didn't you wait for the late dinner?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130305">'Concert down town; can't get off going.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130306">'Did you try?' said De Lyle slyly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130307">'Well, no,' said the other honestly, 'I didn't.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130308">Mr. de Lyle laughed, and, when after a very hurried meal Pat O'Shaughnassy rose from the table, remarked to his neighbour on his other hand that 'it really is an awful pity, but Pat, poor devil! is going the way of all the others.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130309">'What way's that?' said the man in question, who, being brother to one of the officers, and only a visitor in barracks, did not understand the allusion; 'I don't see anything amiss with him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130310">'I'll tell you,' answered De Lyle. ' You must know that the Colonel is guardian to a niece, who is immensely rich and very pretty, but the most terrible flirt in creation. Well, whenever a young fellow joins, it is part of the programme that he shall go through a course of instruction at Miss Lifford's hands. They all do, just as children have the measles and the whooping-cough.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130311">'And how old is Miss Lifford?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130313">'Oh, perhaps two-and-twenty; and really the very nicest girl you ever met. She takes them all in hand, and, somehow, contrives to keep good friends with them, even after they've <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130312" n="30     CAVALRY LIFE"/>got their dismissal. Now the joke is, that Pat O'Shaughnassy has known her ever since she left school; and as he stands second on the list of subs, he might reasonably be expected to know better. Within the last few weeks he has literally lived to the tune of Alys Lifford. The days he is on duty he! is an absolute nuisance to everyone; indeed, I am obliged to I lock my door against him. And yet, do you know, I'm sorry! for him, for he's a downright good sort of chap.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130314">An hour later the regular mess-dinner was in full swing, when suddenly Captain Gurney asked 'what had got Pat O'Shaughnassy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130315">'The old game,' answered a voice from the other end of I the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130316">'Silly fool!' remarked the senior Captain, with great contempt.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130317">'He's not been polished off quite so soon as they usually are,' observed Jack Hilton. 'I should have thought Miss Lifford would have got sick of him by this time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130318">'Don't know,' laughed another. 'Pat's very amusing sometimes. I heard a lady ask him, at St. Hilary's wedding, whether his name was pronounced O'Shanassy or O'Shaucknassy, as she knew both families. Pat told her, with the most barefaced coolness, that he wasn't an Irishman at all; he came from Kent.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130319">'Awfully good!' cried a chorus of laughing voices.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130320">'Ah, but he said a neater thing than that,' put in Jack Hilton. 'One day last week Miss Lifford asked us to go in to tea on Sunday afternoon; and Pat said gravely, "I think I will be on duty, but I'll come if I can; but if I don't come, you won't expect me."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130321">This raised another laugh. Most of my readers are probably aware that it does not take much to provoke mirth and hilarity at a military dinner-table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130322">'Stop a bit, stop a bit!' cried Jack; 'you haven't heard the cream of the joke yet. On Sunday, you know, young Drew was on duty; so Pat and I went up to the chief's together.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130323">'"So you managed to get off," said Alys, as we went in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130324">'"Well, no, I didn't," answered Pat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130325">'"Then, how is it you're not in barracks?" she asked, evidently thinking he had been fool enough to sneak out unawares.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130327">'"Because I told Micky Drew's man to call him early this <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130326" n="31     REGIMENTAL VALENTINE"/>morning; and, faith, the poor chap got up, in all the cold, and did my work, without being any the wiser."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130328">'And the beauty of the joke is,' continued Hilton, 'that Pat, in his innocence, really thinks he has stolen a march upon Drew, and hasn't a ghost of an idea that his name was changed for Drew's in the order-book late on Saturday night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130329">'How was it his man did not tell him?' said someone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130330">'Because, to make all complete, Pat told him that Mr. Drew was going to take his duty to-morrow; and of course the man, having seen the order-book, thought nothing about it. It was pure good luck his pitching upon Drew, though.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130331">'By George!' exclaimed Captain Gurney, 'this is the 12th, surely. We must send Pat a valentine!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130332">'So we must!' cried the others.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130333">'I wonder if Miss Lifford will send him one?' said Fred Gordon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130334">'Not she. Suppose we send him one from her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130335">'So we will. What shall it be? Hollo, Gurney! what have you got in your head now?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130336">For the senior Captain was leaning with both elbows on the table, his face buried in his hands. Presently he raised it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130337">'Wait a minute, you fellows,' he said slowly. 'Pat's on duty to-morrow, isn't he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130338">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130339">'Then, we'll write a proposal from him to Miss Lifford, and send the note by an orderly; her answer, which is safe to be a refusal, will be a grand surprise for him on St. Valentine's Day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130340">This daring proposition was received in silence; the officers of the 52nd Dragoons looked from one to another in speechless amazement, mingled with admiration for the master-mind which had conceived this brilliant plot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130341">At length Fred Gordon relieved his feelings by a prolonged 'B-y Jove!' and then the whole assembly broke out into a torrent of eager questions.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130342">'Will it be safe?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130343">'You'll tell us exactly what to say to Pat?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130344">'You'll write as if from him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130345">'I suppose she is quite sure to refuse him?' said Jack Hilton doubtfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130346">'Safe to' replied Captain Gurney confidently; 'it will be the best joke we have had since St. Hilary got spliced.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130347" n="32     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130348">'Who will write it?' said George Wintringham; 'because it must be done carefully, and made spoony enough.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130349">'I'll write the rough copy,' replied Captain Gurney, 'and then we must get hold of some of Pat's writing to imitate.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130350">'You need not do that,' announced Fred Gordon; 'Billy Childers writes exactly the same fist as Pat.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130351">'Are you sure?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130352">'Perfectly certain; I don't think even Pat himself could tell the difference; and Miss Lifford will not be so familiar with his hand as all that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130353">By the united efforts of the officers the following letter was produced:</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_1205"><body xml:id="jwcaval_1204"><div xml:id="jwcaval_300" type="letter"><opener><dateline>'<name type="place">Cavalry Barracks, Milchester</name>,

If it were not posted Pat would smell a rat directly, and never believe it came from Miss Lifford at all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130366">The answer was accordingly posted; and on the following day, as usual on the feast of St. Valentine, all the letters were saved until luncheon, at which meal the officers were assembled to enjoy the fun.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130367">'Here's one for you, Chim,' said Patrick O'Shaughnassy, taking a packet from the heap; ' come, open it out, man, and let us see.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130368">The packet contained a lady's long fur ruff, and a very official-looking note, purporting to have come from the commanding officer of the 90th Hussars (for Mr. Drew had only a few months before exchanged into the 52nd from that regiment), to the effect that the caudal appendage had been found in Sub-Lieutenant Drew's quarters, and was therefore forwarded, with a request that any other such property which Mr. Drew might have left behind should be at once removed, otherwise his late quarters in——Barracks would be seriously incommoded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130370">Mr. Drew might certainly have passed for the missing link we hear so much about, and his regimental cognomen of 'Chimpanzee,' more often shortened into 'Chim,' suited his personal appearance to a nicety. As usual, he had to laugh off <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130369" n="34     CAVALRY LIFE"/>his chagrin with the best grace he could muster, when, happily for him, the general attention was diverted from him, as Patrick O'Shaughnassy carelessly picked up from the heap on the table the delicately perfumed crested note which was to convey such startling news to him. He did not dream that it came from Miss Lifford, and turned it over with infinite a contempt.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130371">'Ugh!' said he; 'an afternoon tea, I suppose. "My dear <hi rend="italic">Captain</hi> O'Shaughnassy"—ah, I know their little ways.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130372">'For the love of Heaven, don't sit drivelling there, man!' cried an impatient voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130373">'Oh, it isn't a valentine,' remarked another, in a disappointed tone, when O'Shaughnassy took out a note and began reading it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130374">'Go on with the others,' said Gurney, in order to avert suspicion—a command which no one obeyed, all being too busy watching Pat, amid a silence which had become quite oppressive.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130375">'What the d——' began he, then checked himself, and, turning the paper over, read it again; changing colour the while from scarlet to white, then from white to scarlet, as though he could not make up his mind which was most becoming to his complexion, finally compromising the matter by remaining the colour of a mangel-wurzel. He picked up the envelope and examined it; then he took up the letter again carefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130376">'Well,' he said at last, surveying the eager faces crowding round him, 'you chaps have got yourselves into a fine shindy this time, and no mistake about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130377">'What is it? what does she say?' they cried, as with one voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130378">'Upon my——' he began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130379">'Here, give it to me,' said Gurney, who began to suspect Pat was right, and they had got into a 'shindy,' as he said—'give it to me,' at the same time snatching it out of his hands, and reading it quickly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130380">It was not a very long epistle, but its contents elicited an oath, not loud, but deep, from between the reader's closed teeth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130381">'I told you so,' said Pat reassuringly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130382">'What is it?' cried the others. 'She has not, surely, accepted you?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130383" n="35     REGIMENTAL VALENTINE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130384">O'Shaughnassy nodded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130385">'Oh, well, it's all right, then,' said Gordon, in a relieved tone. 'Pat's got all he wants, and she need never know anything at all about it; a very good thing for Pat, I say.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130386">'Perhaps Pat says the contrary,' interposed that young gentleman. 'I've not asked Miss Lifford to marry me, and, what is more, I am not going to do so. I don't intend to marry a woman simply to get you fellows out of a scrape. No. no; Pat O'Shaughnassy may be a thundering fool, he's not quite such an idiot as to do that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130387">'Why, Pat,' exclaimed Jack Hilton, ' we all thought that you were "dead nuts" on Miss Lifford.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130388">'Did you, really? Well, all I have to say is, that you've got yourselves into a pretty shindy this time, and won't there be old Harry to pay when the chief comes home! By Jove! I wouldn't stand in your shoes for a good sum. Perhaps, after this, you will be leaving your neighbours' private affairs alone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130389">'Dash it all!' snapped Gurney, 'why can't you marry Miss Lifford, and have done with it? You've been dangling after her, morning, noon, and night, for weeks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130390">'To tell you the honest truth, my dear fellows,' said Mr. O'Shaughnassy, with slow deliberation of utterance, 'to tell you the honest truth—<hi rend="italic">I am already engaged to be married!</hi>'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_023" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130391">IF the hero of this little history had suddenly emptied a pail of iced water over the group of officers assembled in the mess-room of the Milchester Barracks, a more perceptible shiver could not have run through them. Not a word was spoken. The brave men who would have cheered their troops on against an enemy, or faced grim death without a sign of flinching, looked in one another's faces blankly, each asking a tacit question, ' What are we to do?' receiving for answer, 'I'm dashed if I know!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130392">In their midst stood Patrick O'Shaughnassy, taller by some inches than any of them; his arms carelessly crossed upon is broad chest; his good-humoured face wearing a pleasant Smile, and his gray eyes—real Irish eyes they were—shining with mirth. At last the smile deepened into a laugh, which displayed strong white filbert-shaped teeth.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130393" n="36     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130394">'Well, as I said before, gentlemen, you've got yourselves into a pretty shindy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130395">'No one can compliment you on the pleasing variety of your remarks,' sneered Captain Gurney. 'That's the fourth time you've made that brilliant observation.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130396">'So it is. Well, Gurney, you've a very good opportunity of showing your wonderful cleverness,' said Pat, who could afford to be civil, 'and letting the world see if you are as clever at getting out of scrapes yourself as you are of getting other fellows in. When you've got the thing settled, I'll change the " into" into "out," and say it as many times again. I'm going now. I shouldn't like my presence to be any hindrance to the general conversation. Good-bye.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130397">With a gay laugh, O'Shaughnassy went noisily out of the room, and ran quickly up the echoing corridor to his own domain. Safely there, he immediately locked the door, and, flinging himself on his bed, indulged in the luxury of a hearty laugh, rolling over and over—burying his face in the pillows to smother the sound of his hilarity. At last he calmed down a little, and, smoothing out Miss Lifford's letter, which he had recaptured from Captain Gurney, read it again with care. I mentioned before that it was not lengthy; indeed, it ran thus:</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_1207"><body xml:id="jwcaval_1206"><div xml:id="jwcaval_301" type="letter"><p xml:id="jwcaval_130398">'You have made me happy—very happy indeed.

Then his more natural mode of expressing his satisfaction came in the words, 'By Jove! what a lucky chap I am!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130401">Could Mr. O'Shaughnassy be alluding to the young lady about whom there had been so much discussion below?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130402">His next movement was to change his uniform for plain clothes, and, after locking Miss Lifford's note in a secure place, to light a cigar, and proceed to search amongst the chaos on the table for a pair of gloves. Whilst he was thus employed, someone tried to open the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130404">'Come in!' roared Pat. 'Come in, you fool, can't you? <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130403" n="37     REGIMENTAL VALENTINE"/>Oh, the door's locked, is it? Well, old man,' as Jack Hilton came in, 'what's up now?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130405">''Pon my word,' began Jack dolefully, 'how the deuce we are to get out of this business I don't know; I've a good mind to send my papers in at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130406">'About the best thing you can do,' said Pat consolingly, and still continuing his search; 'and as you are going to be married, it won't make much odds to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130407">'By George! but Gurney is in a funk.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130408">'And so should I be,' said Pat, 'if I were in his shoes—a confounded fool! It's to be hoped this will cure him. Well, now,' having found his gloves, 'I must be off; ta-ta!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130409">'Stop, stop!' cried Hilton; 'where are you going? To the Colonel's?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130410">'Now, my good fellow, do you expect me to go and patch up your damages just by being asked?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130411">'O Lord! I didn't know. You always do go there.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130412">'If it's any satisfaction to you to know it, I'm going into Milchester.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130413">'To meet Miss Lifford?' said Hilton eagerly, like a drowning man ready to catch at the weakest straw.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130414">'I am not going to meet Miss Lifford,' said Pat, looking back at the door, and closing it just in time to escape a missile, in the shape of a boot, which Mr. Hilton flung at his head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130415">Ah, it is only in a university or a barrack that one man can go into another man's room and fling his own boots at his head without provoking offence! Truly there is something of Arcadia in both places!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130416">When Patrick O'Shaughnassy told Jack Hilton he was going into Milchester, he was speaking sober truth; for into that most dreary of dreary towns he really did go. At the first stand, however, he took a cab, and, pulling up the blind windows, ordered the man to drive to Colonel Lifford's. The chief's house was in the centre of a village about a mile and a half from Milchester, on the road which led past the barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130417">Having satisfied himself by a peep from the little window at the back that none of the officers were in sight, he slipped out, telling the driver to come back in an hour, and answer no questions.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130418">He found Alys Lifford sitting alone in the drawing-room, and, as she sprang up with pretty eagerness to meet him, took her bodily into his arms.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130419" n="38     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130420">'My darling! My best and dearest!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130421">For some time their conversation was not rational, nor indeed was it fluent. Then Patrick, feeling that 'life is short and time is fleeting,' set about broaching to Miss Lifford the subject which was just then occupying the attention of the gentlemen in the Milchester Barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130422">'My darling,' he began, with a cough, 'you got a note from me yesterday?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130423">Miss Lifford raised her head from his shoulders and regarded him with blank amazement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130424">'Of course I did, and answered it. You didn't write to me again, did you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130425">'I didn't write at all,' blurted out Pat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130426">'Did not write at all? What do you mean? Are you mad, Mr. O'Shaughnassy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130427">'Well, it was "them." I knew nothing at all about it till I got your letter this morning.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130428">'<hi rend="italic">Them?</hi>' repeated Alys slowly, unconsciously using Pat's ungrammatical form of speech. ' Did they write the letter I got yesterday?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130429">'Yes; confound them!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130430">'And did they see my answer?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130431">'I could not help it,' said Pat humbly. 'What was one against so many? You won't be angry with me, will you, my darling?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130432">'Captain Gurney and Mr. Hilton,' said a servant, opening the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130433">Alys Lifford came forward as the two men walked into the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130434">'I never, in all my life, heard of such an ungentlemanly, disgraceful action—never! I could not have believed it possible. Unmanly, cowardly!' she cried passionately, though the sound of tears was in her voice. 'I do not know which of you is the worst or the most to be blamed; but, as surely as I am Alys Lifford, I will never speak to any of you again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130435">She vanished into an inner room, and the three men stood as if turned to stone. All the colour faded from Patrick O'Shaughnassy's ruddy face, leaving it as white as death. He crossed the room to where his senior was standing, and gripped his shoulder with trembling fingers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130437">'As I live, I'll pay you out for this fine trick!' he said, in a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130436" n="39     REGIMENTAL VALENTINE"/>low voice, shaking with suppressed passion. ' You shall live to repent it, confound you!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130438">Then he stalked out of the room without another word.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130439">'I shall send in my papers at once,' said Jack Hilton, in the tone of a martyr. 'As for you, Gurney, you had better shoot yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130440">'Umph!' said Captain Gurney doubtfully.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_024" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130441">A WEEK passed away, and still Colonel Lifford did not return from his leave. The officers of the 52nd during that time went through various stages of misery.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130442">Occasionally they displayed symptoms of swaggering bravado, but they neither deceived themselves nor each other, and the general tone of society in the mess-room might be fairly described as 'hang-dog.' Colonel Lifford was a martinet of the very fiercest calibre, and the dread with which his return was anticipated was simply pitiable.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130443">The state of Mr. O'Shaughnassy's temper did not add to the general hilarity of the community. As George de Lyle expressed it, ' Pat was for all the world like a bear with a sore head.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130444">None of them ventured into his room, nor, indeed, said a word to him on any subject whatever, except one or two who were not involved in the scrape.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130445">Jack Hilton kept his word and sent in his papers, so consequently felt a little more at his ease than his comrades; and Miss Lifford kept her word and 'cut' the whole of them, Which was, as Thorold told her, an awful shame, on the strength of which she made an exception in his favour, and flirted with him in a disgraceful manner. For poor Patrick O'Shaughnassy she had no mercy. At the cathedral, palace, theatre, and at all other places where they met, she did not deign to notice him in the least, though he, poor fellow! as all his comrades knew, tried again and again to soften her wrath.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130446">At the end of a week the news came that Colonel Lifford had fallen in the hunting-field and broken his arm. I'm afraid his officers were not so sorry as they should have been; but the accident meant to them a respite, and when Mrs. and Miss Lifford departed to join the sick man, they fell back into their old ways and breathed freely once more.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130447" n="40     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130448">Patrick O'Shaughnassy's ill-temper, however, increased visibly, and, after a fortnight not very pleasantly passed, he announced that he had got a month's leave and was going to be married.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130449">'Going to be married!' cried the officers in chorus. 'Why, Pat, we all thought——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130450">'What business had you to think, then?'retorted Pat, it must be owned somewhat uncourteously. 'I can't stand this any longer, so I'm going to get married, and see if that will mend it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130451">At the door he fired a parting shot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130452">'And I hope you'll find it pretty warm when the chief comes back.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130453">'Selfish brute!' remarked Captain Gurney, when he had gone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130454">'Poor devil!' commented De Lyle. 'I never thought Pat would have taken it so much to heart. Any way, I do pity the girl.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130455">The weeks slipped away, and still Colonel Lifford was absent; his broken arm proved very troublesome, and he had received such a shaking from his fall that his medical advisers forbade his returning to duty for some time. At length he was able to do so, and the Major announced that he might be expected on the 7th of the month, during the week that the Yeomanry Cavalry were assembled in Milchester for their annual training. This news filled the gallant officers of the 52nd anew with dismay and consternation. They were in ' no end of a funk, by Jove!' And when it was reported that he had arrived in the town, and did not make his appearance in the barracks, it was considered a very bad sign, from which they inferred that his wrath was indeed terrible.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130456">Whilst this black state of affairs was being discussed in the anteroom, Patrick O'Shaughnassy walked in, looking as bright and jolly as if he had never had a trouble in his life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130457">'I hear the chiefs back to-day,' he said, with a hearty laugh. 'I suppose you men are all quaking in your shoes!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130458">No one answered, and there was silence until Gordon said that they understood he had gone away to be married.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130459">'So I did,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130460">'And didn't it come off? We never saw any announcement.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130461" n="41     REGIMENTAL VALENTINE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130462">'Come off? Of course it did. The missis is down at the Royal Swan.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130463">'Who is she?' asked Billy Childers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130464">'Who is she? Why, Mrs. O'Shaughnassy, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130465">'Shall we see her at the ball those yeomanry fellows give to-night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130466">'Oh yes. Good-bye. Wish you good luck for to-morrow!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130467">A few hours later the officers of the dragoons went into the brilliantly-lighted ballroom.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130468">'Do you think the O'Shaughnassys have come?' said De Lyle to one of the hosts.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130469">Yes, half an hour ago, at least. What a pretty girl she is! You'll see them somewhere about,' said he, and moved away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130470">'There's Pat,' said Gurney; 'and, by the Lord Harry! he's dancing with Alys Lifford. What does that mean?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130471">'She looks happy enough, and better friends than Pat's wife will like if she hears the story.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130472">'Oh, she never will hear it. Pat isn't such a fool as to tell her himself. I wonder which is she?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130473">'There's Pat. I say, Pat, aren't you going to introduce us to your wife?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130474">'Oh yes, to be sure. Come along.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130475">He led them across the room to where a lady, dressed in the richest bridal costume, was talking with other ladies.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130476">'My darling, here are some of my brother officers come to make your acquaintance,' he said. 'Captain Gurney and Mr. Gordon—Mrs. O'Shaughnassy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130477">To their unspeakable astonishment, Mrs. O'Shaughnassy had the dark eyes, the pure profile, and the smiling mouth of Alys Lifford.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130478">'Why—Miss Lifford!' gasped young Gordon. 'I—I—you—at least——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130479">'Ah,' she laughed, 'you are thinking of the tragic vow I made the day I found you out. Well, I have kept it. I am not Alys Lifford now, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130480">'And I think I kept mine,' laughed her husband joyously 'I think I paid you all out. Oh, did we not steal a march upon you! I can tell you, though, it was precious hard work keeping up the sulks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130482">Although everything came to such a happy and orthodox ending, Colonel Lifford said a few words the next day which brought the tingling blood into the cheeks and ears of his <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130481" n="42     CAVALRY LIFE"/>listeners; and since that time Captain Gurney finds it as well to leave his friends' private affairs in their own hands. He has learnt from experience that there is a Nemesis which repays even such apparently insignificant unkindness as he took so much pleasure in inflicting upon others, for into two of the most pleasant houses amongst the married officers of the 52nd he is never asked; and, although Gerard St. Hilary; and Patrick O'Shaughnassy, having obtained their hearts' desire, would willingly forget and forgive past offences, their wives imperatively decline to give Captain Gurney the chance of making more mischief, on the very sensible ground that 'prevention is better than cure.'</p></div></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_030" n="3" type="story"><head>A REGIMENTAL POET;<lb/>OR, BORROWED PLUMES.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_031" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130483">IT was just eleven o'clock when Stephen Thorold went up the dreary stone staircase to his rooms on the second floor of the block known as G in Colchester Barracks. He was very tired, for he had been orderly officer for the day, with the delight of a court-martial thrown in. The Colonel had been particularly disagreeable all day, and he had after dinner, worse luck, as he told himself, somehow got into conversation with the Major, who had talked the prosiest and driest of 'red-book' for two long hours. It was, therefore, with a sense of intense relief that he found himself free to go to bed, with no fear of being orderly officer again for at least a week.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130485">He went slowly up the empty, echoing stairs, his sword clanking after him noisily, and entered his room, banging the door to as if he wanted to try the strength of its panels and the reliance to be placed on its lock. Everything looked very comfortable and inviting: the fire blazed brightly in the grate and cast a pleasant, mellow glow over the whole apartment; the crimson curtains, drawn closely over the windows—there were no blinds—if a little faded and shabby by daylight, looked well and cosy enough in the firelight's fitful glow, which danced and gleamed over everything—now on the broad frames of the pictures, then on the ivory keys of the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130484" n="43     A REGIMENTAL POET"/>open piano. It flickered across Stephen's crisp, curly, yellow hair, and for a moment dazzled his tired gray eyes, so that he had to put up his hand to shade them. Then he slipped off his belts, hung his forage cap on one of the pegs behind the door, and sank lazily into the huge armchair, with a sigh of the deepest content that the worries of the day were over. And it certainly had been a tiresome day; he didn't know what had possessed the chief lately, but he was very different to what he used to be; perhaps it was with getting married! And then a vision of a bright face, with ruddy brown hair and laughing blue eyes, came before him, and he decided that matrimony could not surely be the cause of the lamentable alteration in the commanding officer of his regiment. But, all the same, the bright face and the ruddy brown hair and laughing blue eyes did not belong to Mrs. Lifford, but to Judith Scrope, the fifth daughter of the Brigade-Major's father-in-law; that is to say, she was Mrs. Winton's only unmarried sister. Stephen wondered wistfully what she had been doing all day. He had passed her house, or, rather, the Brigade-Major's house, that morning, when he rode with the troops to watering order, but not a glimpse of her had he seen, either in going or returning. There had been a garden-party up at Lexden, he believed; he wondered had Judith been there. He hardly thought so; she had said a few days before that it was getting too cold for garden-parties, particularly as she did not care much for them. Having arrived at this important conclusion, Stephen thought he would go to bed; he upheaved himself therefore out of his chair, locked his door, kicked his boots off, not without an anathema upon their tightness, and, after a careful survey of himself in the glass, went into the little inner room where his bed was, and in less than two minutes was sound asleep. But in that sleep—at least it seemed so to him; it was not like the half-moment between sleeping and waking, but must have been drawn out over hours—Stephen had a dream, a truly awful one, for he dreamed that Judith Scrope had married the Devil, and that they had come to take him away to the infernal regions, that they might there amuse themselves and the numberless legions of the imps and fiends, by putting him to death by torture of the most cruel and lingering description.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130487">As might reasonably be expected, Stephen Thorold awoke with a start, trembling in every limb, and with great beads of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130486" n="44     CAVALRY LIFE"/>agony standing out upon his forehead. There was a great noise going on, and for a moment he hardly realized that he had just then no fiends to encounter worse than his brother officers and comrades-in-arms. As soon as the truth of the situation flashed across his brain, he jumped out of bed and opened the door into his sitting-room. Pouf! It was all filled with smoke! Then, those confounded idiots were trying to blow his door in. Ugh! the rooms would smell of gunpowder for a week. He went back to bed and laid listening to them. He could hear hushed voices just outside the door, then a dead silence, save for a faint sound as of one metallic substance tapping against another! He knew what that meant well enough; they were filling the lock with powder. Then there was a breathless pause, followed by a scramble across the landing, and a fouf—f—f—fizz—<hi rend="italic">bang!</hi> Stephen leaned out of bed, and, as the smoke gradually cleared away, saw, with a thrill of intense satisfaction, that the door had not given way. Of course, he did not doubt for a moment that they would ultimately succeed in effecting an entrance—he had been there too often for that—but, still, it was some satisfaction to know that they had had a good deal of trouble in doing it. He lay peeping round the corner between the two rooms, so that he might hear what went on, and yet be ready to jump under the bedclothes and feign slumber when the crisis did come. They were wonderfully quiet; whatever could they be at now? He had not the smallest hope that they had gone away and left him in peace; he knew them all too well!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130488">'Scatter a good lot under the door,' he heard a voice say; Chantry's he thought it was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130489">'All right,' was answered with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130490">Quick as thought Stephen sprang out of bed. 'Confound them! the whole place will be on fire,' he muttered, then ran and flung the door open. 'What the devil do you want?' he asked fretfully. 'Hang it! I do think you might choose a night when a poor devil hasn't been on duty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130491">He might as well have talked to the winds! There were eight or ten of them, all flushed with champagne and full of mischief, exasperated by the two tedious hours they had to remain whilst the Major was prosing to Stephen. Amongst the babel of voices Stephen's was lost entirely, and they shoved him in with scant ceremony, and began 'hay-making!'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130492" n="45     A REGIMENTAL POET"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130493">Poor Stephen was so thoroughly tired and sleepy that he almost dozed off as he stood, notwithstanding the general havoc which was being made of his furniture. He half hoped they were going to leave him in peace and quietness when they had turned everything thoroughly topsy-turvy, and he wished they would be quick and get their task done.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130494">Unfortunately, he had left the despatch-box drawer in his chest open, and one of them perceiving it, half a dozen hands plunged into it instantly; that roused him quickly enough.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130495">'Oh, confound it!' he exclaimed energetically, and rushed into the midst of the excited group. 'Leave that alone, will you!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130496">But the harder he fought, the more they persisted in ransacking the contents of the drawer. He raved, he cursed, he swore, to no more purpose than making them laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130497">He was a fine strong young fellow, nearly six feet in his stockings; but what was the strength of one man—in his nightshirt, too, and with bare feet, which every now and then got a prick from his tormentors' spurred heels—against so many?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130498">'Hold him fast, can't you?' said Captain Gurney, in an authoritative voice, as Stephen almost succeeded in wrenching a handful of papers out of his grasp. 'Oh, by Jove, they're poems!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130499">A shriek of laughter greeted this announcement, and Stephen struggled yet more fiercely to shake off his captors' grip.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130500">'They're poems,' said Captain Gurney complacently, crossing the room leisurely, and proceeding to light the two tall candles on the mantel-shelf. 'Ye-es, they're poetical effusions, Now, if you'll keep the young cub quiet, I'll read them aloud.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130501">A cheer of applause greeted this proposal, followed by renewed but ineffectual efforts from Stephen to free himself. At length, however, order was sufficiently restored for the senior Captain to make himself heard.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130502">'"To an Old Glove!"' he began, amid loud cheers and an authoritative order for 'Silence!'</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Crumpled and buttonless,</l><l>Tarnished and torn;</l><l>You're to be pitied, but—</l><l>You she has worn.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Pressing her little hand,</l><l>Happy you were;</l><l>You toyed with her earring,</l><l>Played with her hair.</l></lg><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130503" n="46     CAVALRY LIFE"/><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Fortunate more than all,</l><l>Blessed tinger-tips—</l><l>You kissed her dainty cheek,</l><l>Even her lips."</l></lg><p xml:id="jwcaval_130504">'Rather strong that,' said the reader, by way of comment.</p><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Constant companion,</l><l>But for a day;</l><l>Truly your happiness</l><l>Fleeted away!</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Why all this rhapsody?</l><l>You're but a glove,</l><l>Bringing before me</l><l>The ghost of a love.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Like you, love faded, and</l><l>Lightly was worn,</l><l>Lightly was thrown away,</l><l>Tarnished and torn."'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_130505">'So she tossed you over, did she, Stephen?' said Hugh Chillingly, more commonly known as 'Cabbage.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130506">But Stephen, finding his efforts unavailing, had relapsed into sulky silence, and did not reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130507">'Old Stephen looks as black as a double-distilled thundercloud,' laughed Jennyns, sending a pellet of paper at Stephen's head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130508">'Here's another,' said Gurney at that moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130509">'Oh, let's have it, by all means!' cried Hunt.

Then he went to bed as before and slept, not dreaming this time that Judith Scrope had married the Devil. His visions were even worse than that, for he dreamed that she had married Captain Gurney; and when he awoke he was not sure that, of the two, the latter would not be the greatest and most dire calamity. He absolutely hated the senior Captain.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_032" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130538">THERE was no doubt whatever that Stephen Thorold, Lieutenant of the 52nd Dragoons, was very much in love with the Brigade-Major's sister-in-law. That the senior Captain of that regiment was in the same boat with him was a fact not generally so well known; nevertheless, it was perfectly true. At last Captain Gurney had fallen in love! Not, mind you, in the 'lightly-come-lightly-go' fashion, in which nine men out of ten are perpetually paying court to the sightless god, but in real, genuine, downright earnest. He had two or three years earlier been attracted by Mrs. St. Hilary—then Elinor Warwick—and later he had admired Alys Lifford sufficiently to do everything he could to prevent Patrick O'Shaughnassy from marrying her; but for neither of these ladies had he ever felt as he did for Judith Scrope. He used to wonder sometimes what there was in the girl to make him care for her so much. She was hardly a beauty—indeed, her beauty was chiefly of the kind known across the Channel as <hi rend="italic">du diable</hi>. She was young and bright, had clear, laughing blue eyes and ruddy brown hair, but she really was not a beauty. Captain Gurney admitted that, and yet—and yet—those laughing eyes disturbed his slumbers quite as often as Stephen Thorold's; and since he had known her he had grown <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> tired of practical joking. After all, he thought, when he left Stephen's room that night and sought his own—after all, it was but poor fun; and he didn't know if it was not rather beneath <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130537" n="50     CAVALRY LIFE"/>him to indulge in it. He would most likely be Major before very long, and then, of course, that sort of thing would be utterly out of the question—as impossible almost as for the Commander-in-Chief himself. And so, he thought, as, with a great sigh, he flung himself into a chair and stared moodily into the fire, he didn't know if it would not be as well to give it up at once. It certainly was but stupid work, and lately he had found it but poor sport—that was since he had known Judith. And then Captain Gurney leaned back in his chair and, closing his eyes, gave himself up to delicious waking dreams, dreams of the bright chestnut-haired girl that he had learned to care for, even so much that he wanted to amend his ways for her sweet sake—dreams of her, Judith Scrope no longer, but his wife—dreams of her, together with him, in foreign lands on their wedding-tour—at home in the old house, where he had scarcely ever cared to go since his mother died because the memories which pervaded the whole place seemed out of harmony with the life he was accustomed to lead quiet, happy, <hi rend="italic">respectable</hi> dreams they were, in which Judith Scrope was the leading figure.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130539">The little travelling-clock above his head rang out two sharp strokes ere Captain Gurney roused himself. Then, unlike Stephen, he divested himself of his clothes very deliberately, and stayed to read several much-crushed papers ere he at length sought his couch—and the papers were some of Stephen's poems of which he had taken possession!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130540">When Stephen Thorold turned out of his bed the following morning, his man had set his room in something like order. Therefore, to his master's eyes, the 'hay' which had been made the previous night was of a very trilling description. He looked round with an air of satisfaction, and muttered:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130541">'Not so bad; they've torn that chair-cover, though. I say Simpson—Simp—<hi rend="italic">son!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130542">'Yes, sir,' Simpson answered, bustling in with two large cans filled with water.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130543">'See Mrs. Saunders mends that chair-cover,' he said; 'I think that's all the damage.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130544">'This 'ere glass vase smashed, sir,' Simpson returned, pointing to an empty space on the top of the drawers; 'and the piano's scratched a good deal.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130545">'Umph! Well, there'll be the deuce to pay when Aggio sees that. Ah, well, I suppose it can't be helped.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130546" n="51     A REGIMENTAL POET"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130547">There was no doubt of that; and Stephen Thorold was a young man of as fairly a philosophical turn of mind as may be met with nowadays—ergo, he said no more about the mischief done in his room, but set about dressing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130548">Five minutes later the outer door opened, and Hunt entered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130549">'Are you here, Stephen?' he asked, as he pushed the door open. He glanced round the empty room, and, hearing the splashing of much water in the adjoining apartment, seated himself leisurely in the largest of the three easy—chairs to await Stephen's appearance. At last he came—fresh, rosy, smiling.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130550">'Oh, it's you, is it?' he remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130551">'Yes. I say, old man, you're in for it, and no mistake.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130552">'In for what?'—turning sharply round, and looking inquiringly at his comrade, with his comb suspended in the air above his head, and his curly hair all over his eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130553">'For a three weeks' march.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130554">Stephen groaned aloud, and banged his comb down, with an ugly naughty word upon his lips.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130555">'No use making a row,' laughed his friend.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130556">'No, hang it! I only wish there was!' returned poor Stephen, in great disgust. 'How do you know? Where is it to?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130557">'It's to Dublin, with that draft of horses for the 4th,' he answered. 'And I know, because I've just been down to the mess, and the Major told me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130558">'Why on earth, I wonder, couldn't the Colonel have sent Osborne?' Stephen grumbled, taking up his brush again and proceeding with his toilet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130559">'Oh!'—with a laugh—'he has got out of it nicely. Told the Colonel he has a boil under his knee, and got the doctor to back him up.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130560">'Brute!' said Stephen, with a sigh. 'By Jove! but I will pay him out for this!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130561">'Can't you get up an ailment?' Hunt laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130562">'Why, look at me,' he muttered dolefully. 'A miserable pasty—faced duffer like Osborne can always be ill on occasion but I—why, the chief would only laugh at me'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130563">'Well, you must make the best you can of it,' his friend said, rising and taking a leisurely survey of the numerous little knick—knacks on the mantel—shelf. 'I say, Stephen.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130564">'Well?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130565" n="52     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130566">'Has it ever occurred to you how Gurney is altered?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130567">'Altered! No.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130568">'Ah! I thought you'd have seen it. I can't make out whether he's getting old, or fallen in love, or what; but if you just think of it a moment, he is very much tamer a quieter than he used to be.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130569">'Yes, perhaps he is,' Stephen answered. 'He doesn't care so much about "drawing" fellows as he used to do. Getting past it, I should think.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130570">But no suspicion of the truth crossed his mind. He found, when he went down to the mess, that Hunt's news was but too true. His orders were to start at nine the following morning in charge of a draft of forty—four horses and thirty—four men—the horses for the 4th at Dublin, and to return with the men by sea from Dublin to Portsmouth, and back to Colchester by rail.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130571">'It will take at least three weeks,' muttered Stephen blankly, when he had learned these details and given up a forlorn hope which had, until that moment, flourished in his breast that, after all, Hunt's information might be but a joke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130572">'Cost you a pound a day,' said one officer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130573">'Wish I was going,' cried another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130574">'Horrid boreߞthe responsibility and all that,' quoth a third.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130575">'I shouldn't mind it but for the beastly sea part of it,' remarked a fourth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130576">But Stephen took no heed of their comments; he hurried through his breakfast, and was already outside the mess when officers' call sounded. He was one of the first into the office, and, as soon as he had received his orders, asked for leave from morning stables. It was granted as a matter of course, and Stephen rushed up to his rooms, hurrying off his uniform and dragging on plain clothes with double—quick speed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130577">'Hallo, Stephen, where are you off to?' cried one or two comrades who were dawdling about outside.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130578">'Bye—bye,' Stephen shouted in reply, and was off like the wind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130579">His way took him to the Brigade—Major's house on the Lexden Road, which he reached in an incredibly short time, ringing a peal loud enough to awaken the seven sleepers, and supplementing his efforts by a prolonged hammering at the door. He was performing in the last respect, when the man flung the door open.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130580" n="53     A REGIMENTAL POET"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130581">'Miss Scrope at home, or Mrs. Winton?' he asked, mentioning Mrs. Winton as an after—thought, just for the sake of appearances.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130582">'The ladies have gone up to town, sir,' the man replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130583">'For the day?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130584">'Yes, sir. They are to return by the last train.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130585">'Oh, thanks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130586">He left a card, though it was so early in the day, and turned away feeling dazed and queer, for upon such a calamity as this he had not for a moment counted. And yet, that two ladies should go up to town for the day was not an unusual occurrence; it was only particularly unlucky. For a moment, as he went slowly along the pretty road, he wondered whether it would be much use to go up to town after them. No; it would be like looking for a needle in a bottle of hay, or a pearl amongst a peck of barley. No, that was out of the question; but there was one thing he could do. He might be at the station—by accident, of course—when the last train came in, and there would be no chance of missing them. Having decided upon this plan, he went more hopefully into town, to do a moderate amount of shopping, necessarily of a very moderate description in Colchester, and found his way back to barracks in time for lunch. Most of the officers were already at the meal, and the moment he showed himself in the mess—room he was greeted by a volley of chaff.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130587">'Hallo, here's D.C.L.!' one laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130588">Stephen looked very blank indeed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130589">'What the deuce is the joke of that?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130590">'I say, Stephen,' cried another, 'you won't forget me when you get to the top of the tree?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130591">'What tree?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130592">'Stephen Thorold, D.C.L., Poet Laureate,' he laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130593">'Oh, shut up!' Stephen cried, with great good temper, all things duly considered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130594">'Are you good at impromptus, Stephen?' asked a bald-headed Captain, who, having been in the ranks, was much older than any officer at the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130595">'Pretty fair,' said Stephen, and forthwith put up a long arm and emptied the contents of the mustard—pot over the ancient Captain's hairless pate. 'Of that kind, at least, my friend.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130597">Stephen was like Betty, of world—wide renown—'he knowed his man'; and he disposed of Captain McKey's chaff in a more <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130596" n="54     CAVALRY LIFE"/>summary manner than he would otherwise probably have dared to do. For a moment the laugh turned against the Scotch—man, but it surged back to its original butt immediately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130598">'Well,' remarked the Captain next in seniority to Gurney, 'I've been in this regiment a good many years, and I've seen a good many changes. We've had fellows who could sketch and paint; fellows who could sing and play, or shoot and ride; but I'll be shot if we ever turned out a poet before.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130599">'By—the—by', exclaimed another, 'how did the chief get to hear anything about it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130600">Stephen looked up, the very picture of dismay.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130601">'The chief?' he gasped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130602">'Yes, man, the chief! I heard him laughing with the Major about it this morning.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130603">'Where?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130604">'Oh, I was lying on the sofa in the anteroom, and they were outside.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130605">'What did they say, Standish?' Hunt asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130606">'The Colonel said he understood they were very clever, and then the Major—confound him!—croaked out that he thought. Thorold would be better employed learning his duty, instead of occupying his time in trashy sentimental verses.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130607">'What did the chief say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130608">'Oh, he laughed outright, and said: "Well, I dare say you will never waste your time that way." '</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130609">The tide was quite turned from Stephen then, and the absent Major took up everyone's attention.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130610">'I should think not, ugly brute!' muttered one officer. 'I never could understand how he kept civil long enough for that nice little wife of his to marry him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130611">'Nor I,' Stephen answered. 'How miserable she does look always!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130612">'Oh, they say he thrashes her,' put in the man on Stephen's right.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130613">'Nonsense!' said one or two incredulous voices.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130614">'Fact! I've seen her wrist all finger—marks myself, though, of course, they mightn't be his doing; but, from the way I've seen her watching him when I've been calling or dining there, I should be inclined to believe the worst.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130615">'I wonder she doesn't leave him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130616">'Nowhere to go. Don't you know who she was?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130617">'Not an idea.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130618" n="55     A REGIMENTAL POET"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130619">'Her father was Major of the—rd Foot, and she hasn't a relation in the world—she told me so herself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130620">'Poor little soul!' said Stephen tenderly. 'Oh, but upon my word! the women have hard times very often.' And then be wondered, would the time ever come when he would leave black tokens of his fingers upon Judith Scrope's little slender white wrists? Stephen felt very sure he would not; but, then, doubtless, no man—not even the objectionable Major—Starts with the fixed intention of leading his wife a life of terror and wretchedness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130621">Colchester is not a particularly amusing place, and the day seemed almost as long as the previous one had done. Stephen dawdled through the dull afternoon as best he could, and hailed the dinner—hour with unusual gladness; generally he did not care much about it, one way or another. The Colonel was dining that night, so he was spared any very marked chaff, and the little that went on, in a subdued tone, in his neighbourhood he did not mind. He could not help reddening a little, though, when Colonel Lifford addressed him once or twice; but since he nothing on the subject, he did not care for that very much; either, and so the evening slipped over quickly and pleasantly enough—rather too quickly for Stephen, for it was nearly eleven when the Colonel rose and he was free to betake himself to the station.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130623">He did not, naturally, spend much time in changing his clothes, and, being a good walker, was at the station long before the arrival of the train. Well, that was a comfort! He lounged about the platform, looking at the placards posted up on the walls, consulting his watch, and thinking it not a little strange that Major Winton had not come to meet his wife and sister—in—law. Perhaps he was away; at all events, it would be all the better for him, for he would be able to see them safely home, and thus have a chance of saying what he wanted to say to Judith. He had not to wait 'very long, for presently the appearance of a light in the distance told him that the train was coming. The light gleamed larger, and clearer, and nearer, through the darkness and the night—gloom, and then the train, like an insinuating monster, glided almost noiselessly out. Stephen stood still and watched eagerly. There was Bernard of the Artillery, Lucy of the 200th and his wife, a few soldiers, the quartermaster of his own regiment, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130622" n="56     CAVALRY LIFE"/>and a dozen or so of shabby civilians and women—<hi rend="italic">but there was no Judith Scrope</hi>.
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130624">Poor Stephen was utterly dismayed. He waited until the train had taken its departure, and then he walked slowly out of the station like a man in a dream, refusing an offer of a seat in Captain Bernard's cab without thinking of what he was doing. What could he do? They must have returned by the five o'clock train! What a fool he had been not to come up and meet that one on the chance of their having come by it. Well, he had never thought of it, and it was no use crying over that now; nor could he very well make any excuse to go to Major Winton's house at that time of night. Therefore he could do nothing but submit himself to Fate; that was what was against him. When he reached his rooms he opened his blotting-book and took therefrom a sheet of paper, on which was written a little poem which had escaped the eyes of his tormentors on the previous night.</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_12013"><body xml:id="jwcaval_12012"><head>'KISMET.</head><lg><l>'Alii il ilia,</l><l>Wah Mahmoud rasool ila!</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>Fellow-mortals, why complain</l><l>When you suffer grief or pain?</l><l>Or why triumph when you gain?</l><l>Kismet!

If it's for the best, "Kismet" will keep her true until I come back. I'll run the risk of trusting her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130627">And so it happened that Stephen Thorold went away from Colchester without seeing Judith Scrope again, though, if he had known what a very determined rival he had in the person of Captain Gurney, it is probable that he would not so readily have left his future so trustfully to Fate! And thus also it was that he never missed the verses which had been purloined during the scramble on the previous evening; he had thrust those left on the chimney-shelf back into his drawer, and never thought of examining them closely to see if any were gone.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_033" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130628">STEPHEN THOROLD had gone, and then Captain Gurney had, he felt, a fair field; for, what was best of all, there was no probable, or, indeed, possible, chance of his return for at least three weeks. And what might he not be able to do in three weeks? He sauntered up to the Brigade-Major's house that afternoon, and, more lucky than poor Stephen had been on the previous day, found Mrs. Winton and her sister at home. He was just in time to join them at their afternoon cup of tea, and contrived to make himself so agreeable that Mrs, Winton asked him to dine on the following evening.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130630">And he had a good deal of chat with Judith, too, for several other people came in, and engrossed Mrs. Winton's attention. He was very glad of that, of course, and thought Judith's blue eyes looked more irresistible than ever; he caught himself thinking wistfully, yet with great happiness, that, if only he could win them for his own, if only he could teach the bright face to brighten at his return, the soft eyes to sadden when he left them—he thought his future would have much more real placid, lasting joy than he had ever had in the past. His past had not been happy! He was ashamed, now that he contrasted himself with this ruddy-haired, blue-eyed girl, wearing in all her looks and words, and, surely he could trust his life upon it, in her thoughts, too, 'the white flower of a blameless life:' he was ashamed of his past; it was <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130629" n="58     CAVALRY LIFE"/>so widely apart from hers. The last fifteen of his five-and-thirty years he had spent to worse than no purpose. If he could have gone to sleep at twenty and never wakened up to the present day, he felt even such oblivion would have been better than his worse than wasted years.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130631">'What are you thinking of?' Judith asked suddenly. 'I am sure, of something unpleasant.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130632">'The past,' he answered briefly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130633">'Dear me!' with a laugh. 'Has that been so very disagreeable?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130634">'It has been regretful,' said he gravely, 'and I regret it, though I never did until—<hi rend="italic">now</hi>.'
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130635">'Oh!' she cried lightly, 'it is never any use looking back; and between you and me, Captain Gurney, I always thought it a little—a little—what shall I say? well, spiritless.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130636">'Your past and mine have been different.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130637">'How do you know?' she asked coquettishly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130638">Captain Gurney smiled. 'I know what mine has been,' he answered, the smile about his lips deepening, 'and I look at you and—<hi rend="italic">voilà!'</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130639">Some swift, subtle instinct told Judith that he was right. She knew nothing of the wild orgies, the reckless dissipation, the mad follies and sins, in which his life had been spent; but she looked in his face and she saw the traces of those years' work but too plainly visible. Perhaps Captain Gurney saw that she perceived it, for he changed the subject abruptly, and they drifted away into other topics of a less personal nature, and presently Miss Scrope showed him a well-drawn caricature of the commanding officer of the 200th, which Major Winton had brought home from their mess-table the previous evening.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130640">'I say, it is incomplete,' she said brightly; 'it should have a few words or verses of explanation at the foot; but Mr. Osmond, who drew it, says he has no gift that way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130641">'Let me add the footnote,' he suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130642">'Very well. Here is a pencil, or do you care for ink?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130644">'This will do, thanks.' He wrote a few lines hastily beneath the sketch, and handed it to Judith for perusal. She looked half puzzled for a moment, then began reading, in a low voice, '<hi rend="italic">Speaks short and sharp, eyes unsettled, face flushed. Alas! poor Roland.

'What is it out of?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130646">'Oh, it is part of a scene I wrote some years ago,' the soldier answered carelessly. 'I thought I had mistaken my vocation, and ought to have been poet instead of dragoon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130647">'Oh, you write poetry?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130648">'Certainly not'—with a laugh. 'But in my schoolboy days I strung a few lines together, and thought them verses.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130649">'You have not any with you, I suppose?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130650">'My dear young lady, most assuredly not,' he returned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130651">'I am so fond of poetry,' Judith said dreamily. 'I wish you would bring some of your verses to-morrow evening.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130652">'If you really insist upon it'—in a deprecating tone; 'but really, Miss Scrope, my poor attempts are—are not worth the trouble of reading.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130653">'Bring them,' said she imperatively. 'I shall be dreadfully disappointed if you do not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130654">'Then you leave me no choice,' he replied gallantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130655">He betook himself back to barracks a few minutes later, as sorely puzzled as ever any man was in this world. What he should do he didn't know. He knew perfectly well that the verses he had spoken of would only make Miss Scrope laugh—being the merest doggerel, of this type:</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Oh! my heart is very sore,</l><l>For I shall never see her more,</l><l>And very often I could roar</l><l>For Mary Jane!</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'Oh!

Then suddenly an idea occurred to him. Ah! why should he not copy out those verses he had taken from Stephen Thorold the other night? Happy thought! He would act upon it.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130657" n="60     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130658">Act upon it he certainly did, and found his way to the Wintons' house the following evening, fully prepared to undergo a searching examination from Miss Scrope on the subject of verse-writing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130659">'I hope you have not forgotten the verses,' she said confidentially, when he gave her his arm in to dinner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130660">'I could not forget anything you wished,' he responded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130661">'Oh,' remarked Miss Scrope a little blankly: she had not bargained for that tone of devotion. But after dinner, all the same, she demanded the poems, and, with a little show of unwillingness, Captain Gurney produced them. She took then from him and began reading, in the way she had done on the previous day, almost to herself:</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_12015"><body xml:id="jwcaval_12014"><head>'CHARGE OF CHASSEURS.</head><lg type="stanza"><l>'"The smoke cleared away as the foe was advancing,</l><l>Their massy battalions loomed darkling and large;</l><l>The sun on their bayonets was fitfully glancing</l><l>As the notes of our trumpets rang out for the charge,</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'" And Fortune, alas! ever fickle, had left us,</l><l>And hurled us from victory into defeat;</l><l>Of our best and our bravest black Death had bereft us,</l><l>The rest of the army was beating retreat.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'" The Moblôts were routed, the fellows who spouted</l><l>In terms so heroic—the ci evant braves;</l><l>Save the wounded and dying, the rabble were flying</l><l>Mixed up with the line and the tawny Zouaves.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'" An aide-de-camp, panting, our orders had brought us,</l><l>With bloody foam flecked was his gay sabretache!</l><l>He reeled, ere our lesson he fully had taught us,</l><l>The blood welling under his yellow moustache.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Our colonel's stern face, as he turned to address us,</l><l>Lit up with the battle-glow, lurid though wan,</l><l>'The foe must be checked; you perceive how they press us,</l><l>My lads: we must stop them, or die to a man.'"'</l></lg></body></floatingText></q></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_130662">Miss Scrope laid the paper down with a long, long sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130663">'I think it is perfectly lovely,' she said at last.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130664">'Oh! hardly that!'

He appeared smiling and happy at mess that night, for he had arrived early in the forenoon, and had therefore had time to pay a visit to a certain villa on <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130680" n="62     CAVALRY LIFE"/>the Lexden Road, and where, if the truth must out at once, he had had a most satisfactory interview with a young lady called Judith Scrope. If Stephen looked bright and happy, the senior Captain was the very reverse. He greeted Stephen with a growl, scarcely touched his outstretched hand, and 'shut up' every effort he made to converse with him, with scant ceremony. And poor Stephen was so very innocent! and unsuspecting of the tumult which was going on in his senior's breast. He had come back from a tiresome three weeks' march, a wearisome dawdle of twenty-four hours in Dublin Bay, waiting for orders, a more wearisome voyage of four days, with fearfully rough weather, and a long railway journey back to the place where he should find his love—where he had found her. What wonder was it that, having! found her and set everything 'right,' he should be overflowing with kindliness and <hi rend="italic">bonhomie</hi> to all his brother officers? He took all their chaff good-naturedly, as usual; he told them all about his long journey, and caused screams of laughter by the recital of his adventures, and then someone asked him if he had written any more poetry.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130682">'Well, no, I haven't,' he answered cheerfully; 'and, I say, whilst the subject is afloat, I may as well tell you that I did not write those verses you made such a fuss about just before I went away.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130683">'Oh, by Jove!' cried one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130684">'Who wrote them?' asked another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130685">'Anyone we know?' said a third.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130686">'Well, I'm not at liberty to tell you, except that they were written by a lady,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130687">'A lady!' They were all too much astonished to make a noise, and
most of my readers will know that it takes a good deal to astonish
officers of dragoons.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130688">In spite of their efforts to discover who the author was, Stephen refused to tell them, but presently, when Captain Gurney came up and asked him the question plainly, he gave him a plain, straightforward reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130689">'Who wrote those poems, Thorold?' he asked curtly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130690">'Miss Scrope,' said Stephen quietly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130691">Captain Gurney stood quite still for a moment, and Stephen, being like Duncan Grey of old, 'a lad o' grace,' forbore to look at him at all, but confined his attention strictly to the pictures on the opposite wall.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130692" n="63     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130693">The older man tried for a moment to think. The events of the past month surged into his brain with painful distinctness: How Judith had praised the poems and lifted her blue eyes with such innocent sweetness to his; how she had held him at arm's-length, yet each day drawn him on a little further and a little further; how she had—bah! he couldn't think of it any longer, but he rapped out two short words, which nearly sent Stephen's gravity off the balance, and they were—'Little Devil!'</p></div></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_040" n="4" type="story"><head>THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_328" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130695">CAPTAIN GURNEY was utterly tired of his old regiment, and had made up his mind to leave it. So long as his comfort depended upon the behaviour of his brother officers, he was very well content, for all soldiers are willing to overlook practical jokes, and subalterns are compelled to do so. But sometimes the juniors have wives, and when those wives are very beautiful and very popular women, they have it in their power to make matters particularly unpleasant for any officer to whom they may have taken a dislike. However greatly an officer may be offended and annoyed by so-called jokes, even though they have been carried beyond all bounds of reason, three words will generally set everything straight, and make him forget all about it; but with his wife reconciliation is not always so easily effected; if she resolutely declines to forget what is past, and cannot forgive 'fun'—at the worst only intended to relieve the tedium of dull country quarters—the unlucky offender may find his life much less pleasant than it might otherwise have been to him. Now, this was precisely the box in which Captain Gurney found himself, and he did not relish the position at all. When, after dinner or ball, the men were one and all raving of the beauty and the wit and the charms of Mrs. Gerard St. Hilary or Mrs. Patrick O'Shaughnassy, not forgetting Mrs. Stephen Thorold, it was galling in the extreme to this gallant gay Lothario to be obliged to own that he had no acquaintance with any of them. When all his comrades went on Sunday afternoon to the house of one or other of those ladies for an early cup of tea, he could not do likewise, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130694" n="64     CAVALRY LIFE"/>because he had not been asked. when he met the two first in the street (Judith was more merciful), and they looked him full in the eyes without the slightest inclination of either handsome head, he felt all his temper—and it was a passionately fierce one—surging up tumultuously within him, and he vowed bitter vengeance against the pair of them, and looked forward with intense eagerness to the day when he should have brought one or both of them to his feet; when they should acknowledge his power and atone for bygone scorn with pleading humiliation; when those eyes which looked so straightly into his own should drop before his in supplicating fear. Nay, I must confess, he looked eagerly forward to the time when Gerard St. Hilary and Patrick O'Shaughnassy should find their hearts desolate; but
<q><l>'There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</l><l> Rough-hew them how we will.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130697">The day which Greville Gurney anticipated never came. Without doubt he was handsome enough and fascinating withal, but, bless you! the man never got a chance. Elinor St. Hilary and Alys O'Shaughnassy wouldn't have him at any price; they agreed that their safest plan would be to keep on the firm ground of non-acquaintance, and not trust themselves upon the perilous and extremely uncertain ocean of Captain Gurney's friendship. At last he felt he could endure life in the old regiment no longer; he was too fond of his profession to dream of leaving the army, but he made up his mind that he must exchange, when, to his unspeakable joy and satisfaction, he obtained the majority, and immediately exchanged with Major Ford of the 7th Lancers, then in India. So he turned his back upon the old set, followed only, I fear, by the regrets of his commanding officer, for he was a smart soldier, whom Colonel Lifford was sorry to lose, and Colonel Cornwallis was glad to gain. He gave a handsome piece of silver to the mess-plate, and had a grand farewell dinner given to him, at which, if my reader had been present, he might reasonably, have supposed that the officers were one and all convinced that the hope and prestige of the regiment were departing from them in the person of Greville Gurney; and yet they knew—and, what was worse, he knew—that they were all very glad to be rid of him. But his advent into the 7th was eagerly expected; more especially by the chief, for smart <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130696" n="65     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/>officers, like good-looking curates, are at a premium, so he felt that the change was all for the best.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130698">He had never thought, or indeed intended, to go to India; but after all, he rather liked the idea. The 7th had only some three years to remain in India, and by the time he returned he could set about finding a wife in downright good earnest</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130699">However, before the good ship sighted the Rock, the idea had entered his brain and taken very firm root there, for, curiously enough, he found amongst the passengers Mrs. Cornwallis, the wife of his new Colonel, and her sister, Miss Bannister</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130700">Violet and Dorothea Bannister were co-heiresses, and had been left orphans at a very early age. In appearance they were not much alike, for Violet, the elder by two years, was fair, with a gentle, saint-like expression of countenance, and large, limpid eyes, of so deep a blue that her fanciful young mother had insisted upon her being called Violet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130701">'You know, Jack,' she had said to her husband when he demurred a little, wishing himself to call the child after her, 'we can give the next one my great mouthful of a name;' and so the child was christened Violet, later shortened into Vi; but when the next one came there was no question of dispute about her name, for the young mother lay in a darkened chamber above, while a grave-faced clergyman performed the ceremony of baptism in haste, fearing that the morsel of humanity, whose tiny life had cost so dear a price, would die in his arms ere it was concluded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130702">But the child did not die; the elder Dorothea, with all her strong affections and her bright hopes of life, passed away, but the younger one, with her few hours' hold upon existence, struggled on and lived.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130703">About her name there had been no question, but by it she was never called. Mr. Bannister could not bear the sound of it, and was eagerly glad when, somehow, the tiny, dark-haired, dusky-eyed child came to be known in the household as Floss. So Floss she was called, and Floss she remained, long after her father had followed his young wife across the dark river, and after Vi had been three years married to Colonel Cornwallis of the 7th Lancers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130705">"When Vi had married, at twenty, to go to India immediately—for she had met Colonel Cornwallis whilst on leave—Floss <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130704" n="66     CAVALRY LIFE"/>had not been in very robust health, and the doctors had advised her not accompanying her sister just then. She therefore went to live with the aunt with whom they had spent all their holidays, and who divided her time equally between Paris, London, and Scarborough. The three years had passed in a perfect whirl of pleasure for Floss, but she had not followed her sister's example and entered upon the holy state of matrimony. Mrs. Garth was in no hurry to lose the girl who made her life so daily, hourly bright, whose fascinating ways made her house the most sought-after domicile in whatever town they happened to be living; and so it happened that when, after a few hours' illness, Mrs. Garth was taken away from the pleasures she loved so dearly, Floss was completely left alone. She had no relatives but the Cornwallises, and she telegraphed to Vi to come, if possible, to settle their aunt's affairs, and take her back to India with her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130706">Thus it happened that, after a three months' sojourn in England, Mrs. Cornwallis was returning to her husband, taking Floss with her. And then everything seemed <hi rend="italic">couleur de rose</hi> to Greville Gurney's eyes. Surely no man ever went that voyage with a more contented heart than his! He had nothing to do, nothing to worry him, no disagreeable, handsome subalterns' wives to annoy him with their airs and graces; he had no temptations to indulge in his old favourite pursuit of practical joking, and he had at all hours of the day Floss Bannister to watch and talk to. And, of course, it was pleasant for the sisters to have the Major of their own regiment travelling with them: they made pleasant little excursions wherever they stopped; they had a dozen little innocent jokes of their own—that is to say, strictly among themselves—which they did not share with the other passengers, and the trio enjoyed life immensely. It was <hi rend="italic">couleur de rose</hi> for all of them. Vi, who was going back to her husband, and to seeing whom she counted the days and almost the hours, used to idle under a huge white umbrella, thinking of little else save the stern, bronzed face, with its well-waxed dark moustaches, which was to her as no other on the whole earth; and Floss, always restless, always with some employment, flirting with Greville Gurney, who, for his part, was so supremely, calmly happy that he almost wished the voyage would last for ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130707">But it did not: in time it came to an end, and they reached</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130708" n="67     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130709">Bombay, where they found Colonel Cornwallis waiting for them. It may readily be imagined that during the days which followed Major Gurney's opportunities of seeing Floss Bannister were not lessened; he opened his eyes in astonishment at the marvellous way in which the chief's little wife bloomed out and expanded after they landed; he could hardly believe it was the same woman. He had wondered during the voyage if she could really be Miss Bannister's sister; they seemed so different: the one all fire and vivacity, the other so languidly indifferent to all subjects save that of reaching Bombay. But now that he saw her under what Floss called 'favourable circumstances,' he was fairly dumb with amazement. It was as if a little sickly bud, with seemingly not sufficient strength to bloom, had suddenly been transformed into a gorgeous rose, with all her velvet-like petals, her fragrance and her many graces set forth for the benefit of all beholders; he wondered if Floss would ever love him like that. He did not know; he was not sure. He thought she seemed brighter and more sparkling when he was near her; he fancied her great dark eyes lighted up with more than their usual radiance when he approached her; he tried hard to persuade himself that he was <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> sure she loved him, but he could not altogether succeed. He had made several mistakes upon that subject lately, and, somehow, he had not heart enough to put it to the test and have done with it. He haunted the Colonel's bungalow until the chief suggested to his wife that Gurney had better take lodgings with them altogether, but he got no further with Floss. Try as he would, he could not induce her to look at anything in a serious light: if ever he approached, no matter how cautiously, the topics of loneliness or marriage, Floss immediately opened out upon what she called her 'views.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130710">'I don't think I quite believe in marriage, Major Gurney,' she said one day, when he had expressed his envy of a fellow-officer who was just entering the holy state. 'It's all very well for <hi rend="italic">men</hi>, but for us poor women!—why, it is neither more nor less than giving up a kingdom to become a slave. Now, just take me for an example! I have now between twenty and thirty adorers—humble, abject adorers.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130711">'Yes, I know,' muttered Major Gurney between his teeth. There were just seven-and-twenty, without counting himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130713">'Not that I consider them very delightful,'Floss continued, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130712" n="68     CAVALRY LIFE"/>with gravely pursed-up mouth. 'In fact, strictly between you and me, they are rather a nuisance, so many of them. But, then, supposing I was to marry one of them—why, he might turn out like the husband of a friend of mine. What do you think he does?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130714">'Beats her, perhaps,' suggested the Major.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130715">'<hi rend="italic">Much</hi> worse,' Floss cried energetically—she had not been in India long enough to become languid. 'She is five-and-twenty, a gentlewoman by birth and education, the mother of two children, and he <hi rend="italic">never gives her a penny!'</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130716">'By Jove!' muttered the Major, in astonishment; 'but perhaps she has money of her own?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130717">'Not a farthing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130718">'But how does she dress herself?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130719">'Oh, when she cannot do without a dress any longer, he goes and buys her one, and he pays her dressmaker's bill himself. I have seen him buy six pair of gloves for himself and <hi rend="italic">one</hi> for her; and once, when I was staying there, he went himself to pay a woman who had been helping in the kitchen,' she ended indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130720">'What a mean hound!' ejaculated Major Gurney, in very real tones of condemnation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130721">The mischievous laughter in Floss Bannister's dusky eyes deepened, and the indignant ring in her voice grew more pronounced.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130722">'Ah! but I told that story once to a man who wanted to marry me,' she laughed, 'and he used those very words, "What a mean hound!" I must admit that they sounded so real that he completely took me in, but I heard not long afterwards that during the nine years he was married—for he was a widower—he never once bought <hi rend="italic">his</hi> wife a gown, and the only decent dresses she had her mother gave her!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130723">Within himself Major Gurney groaned. It was no use arguing with Floss any further, he knew; she had triumphed. Yet he laughed! He had, he was perfectly aware of it, many objectionable points, but meanness was not one of them. He laughed half a dozen times that day at the idea of his paying Floss's bills, and doling out a pair of gloves at a time. He thought it would be rather nice than otherwise to have those coaxing eyes uplifted to his, that coaxing mouth teasing for a new dress or a set of furs, to hear her winning tones saying persuasively, 'Greville, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> buy me that bonnet.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130724" n="69     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130725">And yet to him there was something absolutely appalling in the idea of a pretty woman not being able to have as many gowns and bonnets as she required. He should like the coaxing eyes, the coaxing mouth, and the winning tones dearly enough, but he would prefer to hear them say, 'Greville, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> take me for a drive,' or, 'Darling, <hi rend="italic">please</hi> don't stay away a moment longer than you can help,' to 'Greville, <hi rend="italic">do</hi> buy me that bonnet'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130726">When a man is in love, it does not take much to put him into a perfect paradise of bliss—only about as much as is required to throw him into a fever of unrest and misery. Major Gurney that evening was happy—very happy. He went to bed and slept soundly; he did not often do that. He was not bitten once by <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> during the whole night, and he dreamt that Floss Bannister had come and put her soft arms round his neck and said, 'Love me, Greville.' Poor fellow! it was like falling from heaven into the nethermost torment, when he woke to find his bearer's black face peeping through the curtains, and 'Four o'clock, sahib,' sounding in his ears. Why, it was an absolute insult to Floss that a wretched Hindoo should recall her to his mind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130727">As usual, during his morning ride, he fell in with the Cornwallises and Miss Bannister, and, for a wonder, the latter was unattended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130728">'How grave you look!' she remarked, when they were riding quietly abreast. 'Had a bad night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130729">'Quite the contrary—an unusually good one,' he replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130730">'Then, what is the matter?' she persisted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130731">'Oh, I've been thinking of what you said yesterday,' he returned gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130732">'What about?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130733">'About getting married.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130734">An expression of intense amusement came into her eyes, as quickly followed by a certain tenderness, which, if Major Gurney had noticed, would have set everything straight between them; but unfortunately he did not, for Floss's face was bent almost to her saddle.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130735">'And what have you been thinking about?' she asked at length.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130737">Well, of course, what you told me was very bad, very despicable,' he answered, 'and a fellow who behaves like that to his wife ought to be sent to Coventry; but, still, there's <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130736" n="70     CAVALRY LIFE"/>something to be said on our side. Now, I know a lady, Miss Bannister, who never speaks to her husband, if she can possibly help it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130738">'Perhaps he deserves it,' Floss suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130739">'Very likely; only that is hardly the way to help him to grow better, is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130740">Floss pulled her horse up sharply. 'Don't speak to me in that way,' she cried; 'I'm not anyone's wife, thank goodness—if I were, I should behave myself properly; but don't bully me for someone else's misdoings.' And then, like two silly children, they burst out laughing, and rude on again. The Major, however, had something to say, and he meant to say it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130741">'And I once knew a lady who spent just five times as much as her husband could afford, He was a barrister; and to see the poor chap toiling and slaving and working to provide things for her, without thanks even. Oh, by George! but it did make my blood boil. She used to do all sorts of things, too, that he didn't like; and once she proposed a mad freak which I said I was certain her husband would never permit. ' " Permit!" she laughed. "Pooh! I have a hold over that man." '</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130742">'Hateful wretch!' cried Floss passionately. 'I should like to marry her to Winny's husband—he would let her see! Hateful wretch!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130743">But still, although he had gained a victory over Floss, it cannot be said that Major Gurney's wooing throve apace. As if to make up for the serious conversations they had indulged in, Floss for a few weeks gave Major Gurney but little of her society. Of the seven-and-twenty adorers, each had a turn—such a turn, too, that with every one a match was predicted; and then one or two new ones arrived on the scene. Floss polished them all off. She was very particular, too, to carry on her warmest flirtations just under the Major's nose, driving him thereby to the very verge of desperation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130745">And then the Cornwallises obtained leave and went to Simla, from whence he heard plentiful accounts of Floss's doings, and, shall I dare to say it? misdoings. Poor Major Gurney! he railed at the fate which would not give him leave; at the utterly unjust and unequal way in which the little blind god distributes his favours; and thus March a April slipped away. And then he had fresh cause grumbling, for just as the Cornwallises returned, an attack of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130744" n="71     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/>fever laid him on the sick-list, and another fortnight passed before he saw her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130746">And, when at length he was able to crawl over to the Colonel's bungalow, there were rumours afloat which put such thoughts as favour and marriage out of his head—rumours which gave the officers grave faces and the wives fearful hearts, for the chiefest of them was—MUTINY.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_042" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130747">All English people know the history of that fearful struggle by heart—some by the brotherhood of nationality, others by bitter heartaches and weary blanks in the family circle, which may be filled up never more. And there are not a few who can look back to those weary months, when they stood cheek by jowl with grim Death, with famine, torture, and even dishonour in his ghastly train. The words 'Cawnpore,' 'Delhi,' and 'Lucknow' are sufficient to bring to our minds scenes and details which sickened us to read, and which sicken us now to recall to our remembrance. How gently-born, delicately-nurtured women and little children went through fearful privations and hardships during that awful time, only to end by finding themselves widowed or orphans How thousands won for themselves a glorious crown of martyrdom, cruelly as did ever saints of old. How parents saw their little innocent babes murdered before their eyes while waiting for their own turn to come. How husbands shot their wives to save their honour—the tender wives whom they had brought from the safe shelter of their English homes. How, even after that, we are told, they died praying to the end—died, seeing resistance useless, as only the English aristocrat can die—and are not the English of the truest aristocracy, inasmuch as they can fight like tigers and die without a murmur?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130749">Colonel Cornwallis's first anxiety was to get his wife and sister as much out of harm's way as possible, and to he comparative safety of Simla he decided to send them; but, when the arrangements were all completed, an obstacle, unthought of before, presented itself in the shape of Mrs. Cornwallis's consent. He had taken that for granted. The idea of gentle, obedient Vi dreaming for one moment of setting up her will in opposition to his had never occurred to him. Vi, who lived <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130748" n="72     CAVALRY LIFE"/>and breathed and had her very being in him! Vi, who drooped and faded like a flower torn from the parent stem if parted from him even for a day! That Vi should flatly refuse to go he had never anticipated, yet that was what she did.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130750">'I won't go,' she said decidedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130751">'Neither will I,' announced her sister.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130752">Colonel Cornwallis fairly groaned. That Floss should show her will was nothing new, or that she should follow her sister's lead, once in a way. If Vi had stormed and cried, had begged him, with sobs and tears, not to send her away, he would, he knew, have prevailed, but Vi did nothing of the sort. She lifted her great violet eyes boldly to his, she folded her hands placidly, and she said, 'I won't go.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130753">'Neither will I,' said Floss.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130754">'But, my dearest,' the Colonel replied, 'God only knows to what this may lead. In Simla you will be fairly safe. Think of my anxiety, if I see you here suffering and am unable to help you; think of my sorrow, if—if you are wounded, if—oh, Vi, my darling, you must go! I shall at least have the comfort of knowing that you are safe. I insist upon your going.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130755">'No,' she replied firmly, 'I will not go. I have never once crossed your will since our marriage-day. I cross it now by refusing to obey you. It is of no use insisting; I refuse to obey. I took you,' she continued, with a sob in her voice, 'for better for worse, for richer for poorer, till death us do part! This is my place, and here I remain.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130756">'But, great heavens!' cried the Major, who was present, 'you may be killed! We cannot tell what the consequences may be. Floss'—stepping forward and taking her hand—'Floss, persuade her to do as we wish.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130757">But Floss turned upon him with an indignant flash in her dark eyes, and flung his hand from her. 'Do you think we Bannisters are cowards?' she cried passionately. 'If there is danger, we can share it; privation, we can try to lighten it; death, we can die like Christians.' And so they gave in, and the two brave girls won the day, but not before Colonel Cornwallis tried once again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130758">'Supposing I am killed, Vi,' he said gravely, 'I shall die with the agony of knowing that you are left at the mercy of these savages. Will you add that misery to my difficulties?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130760">'No, Bruce,' she answered, 'if we should be taken, I shall find death come sweetest from your hand, out of the pistols <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130759" n="73     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/>which I have loaded and polished for you so often. Yes, in that case, to save me greater torture, you will shoot me—it will be over in a moment. If you are killed, I can trust your officers to protect me, and, failing them,' with a smile, 'I shall have quite sufficient courage to send the bullet home myself.' And so the day was won.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130761">The story went from mouth to mouth, bringing tears to the eyes of the rough stalwart troopers, courage to the drooping hearts of their wives, who had not had the chance of escape, and comfort to the souls of the two men, who knew now what was the depth of those brave, loving, faithful hearts. They were glad then that their entreaties had not prevailed, for the two gentle girls had not stayed to become a burden and a hindrance. Their time was fully occupied, tending the sick and wounded, cheering the brave little band—which grew daily smaller and smaller; going fearlessly amid shot and shell on their rounds of hope and mercy, the sisters won the passionate love and admiration of every man, woman and child in the garrison. It was Vi who gave her last tin of milk for the sick child of a private's wife; it was Vi whose breast pillowed the dying head of trooper and officer alike; Vi, who wrote down loving messages of farewell, to be given if she should live through the rebellion; it was to please Vi that wounded men hushed their groans and terrified women tried to be brave. And Floss, what of her? Of the nursing and the cooking and the washing she did her share, but there was one duty she took upon herself and never failed in. The chaplain had enough upon his hands in burying the dead and helping Vi to comfort the dying; more than twice in the day, he could not visit the outposts. Floss went almost every hour. How the men looked for her coming! With her pale, pale face, and her dark eyes, with her dark silky hair cut close to her head, partly on account of the terrible heat, partly to save time and trouble; with her gown, which had once been white, but, alas! was now all stained and yellow; and with her brave heart, open to all alike now, she seemed to them like some glorious angel, for surely it was the light of heaven which shone upon her face. Sometimes she brought her Bible and read a few verses, sometimes she sang a hymn, but more often she knelt simply down and repeated ' Our Father' in her clear, ringing tones, ending 'The Lord bless us and keep us.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130762" n="74     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130763">She would bring to one man news of his sick wife, to another tidings of his wounded comrade, to all courage and comfort, and still she did not shirk her woman's work.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130764">And then the labour which fell upon her grew heavier, for Colonel Cornwallis was grievously wounded. Vi, who had worked like a very slave, left much of her work in the hospital to Floss; she could scarcely be torn from her husband's side, and so Floss worked harder than ever. Her face grew paler and more wan, her eyes more haggard, her gown more torn and yellow, and upon the little hands, which had once been so white and soft, the traces of work became more apparent, and the enemy crept closer and closer. As her work in the garrison grew heavier, so did her self-imposed labour of love at the outposts and fortifications diminish, for with almost every day she had fewer to visit. Every day brave, bronzed, bearded faces were missing—faces that had brightened at her coming; eyes that had lifted up with tenderest love for her were now closed in the sleep of death; lips that had kissed the little work-worn hands gratefully were silenced for ever. She missed them, with a bitter heartache, and dared not trust herself to think which face might be gone when she came again; but she bore up bravely through it all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130765">In what the defenders of the garrison were pleased to term safety, the misery was greater. No one had time for grief; widows saw their dear ones carried away, but they might not sit down and weep; there was more work than could be done waiting for their hands. Even Vi, having managed to get hen husband a room alone in the little bungalow which stood in the compound of the one they had occupied, but which now formed the hospital, left him a good deal, that she might lighten her sister's load; and so the time went on. Amongst others, the chaplain was killed, so then Floss was the only comforter of the defenders. They watched, anxiously enough, the pale face growing paler, the circles round the dark eyes deepening; they noted the least falter in the gentle voice, which had not much ring left in it, which had neither time nor strength for reading or for hymns, which now only gave utterance to those two short prayers: 'Thy Kingdom come, Thy will be done.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130766">Only that and 'The Lord bless us and keep us.'</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130767" n="75     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/><div xml:id="jwcaval_043" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130768">AT last Greville Gurney had given in, not from wounds, not sunstroke, not malady of any kind—only from sheer fatigue, from overpowering sleep.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130769">Some of the men lifted him on to a mattress, and carried him to the first room of the hospital. Just as they turned away, Floss came out of an inner apartment with scared eyes and a single word upon her lips—'Wounded?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130770">'No, no, miss darlin',' answered one of them, 'only dead beat he is; an hour of sleep 'll do him all the good in the world.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130771">'Ah!'—with a great sigh of relief; then she leant her head against the wall and closed her eyes. The big Irishman looked at her in silence for a moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130772">'I'd just go an' lie down meself, if I was you, miss dear,' he said. 'At last you'll be wearin' yerself out, and we'll have never a soul to say a word of comfort to us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130773">'I'm afraid I must,' she answered. 'I'd go and lie down by the Colonel, only I'm so tired.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130774">The big lancer picked her up like a baby, and ran across the compound with her, taking her right into the chief's room, not a little to Vi's dismay, who feared she was hurt.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130775">'Miss Floss is just tired out, mem,' he announced, 'and We've frightened her to death by carrying in the Major, who's dead beat.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130776">'I thought he would have to give in,' Mrs. Cornwallis said, as the man retired. 'Lie down here, Floss, and I will go and see after things.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130777">'Could you go round the posts?' Floss asked imploringly, 'They will be expecting me, and it wouldn't take you long—just the "Our Father" and the blessing, Vi.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130778">'Yes, I'll do it;' and then she went away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130779">And so the brave souls slept heavily—Floss within sight of the wounded Colonel, and Greville Gurney on the floor of the hospital; and while they slept the enemy crept a little nearer, forced the defenders back, and covered the space between the two bungalows with their fire. At the very first shot Vi Cornwallis sped back to her husband's side, just as Floss, with dazed eyes and scattered senses, sat up on her bed, ordering what the noise meant.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130780" n="76     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130781">'What is it, Vivi?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130782">'I think the end has come,' she said calmly. 'Let me have your hand, Bruce darling.' All her bravery, all her courage rose to the surface then. She sat down quietly beside her husband, with one hand in his, a revolver in her right hand, and a second lying ready loaded on the bed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130783">'<hi rend="italic">What'a that?</hi>' Floss cried, clasping her hands together.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130784">There was no answer; a shell came through the roof with
a crash, while from the opposite building rose a wild shriek of 'Fire!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130785">'What's that?' Major Gurney asked, starting up from his hardly-earned repose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130786">A young officer, just entering the room, answered him hastily:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130787">'A shell has sent the Colonel's room to smash, and they're all there!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130788">Greville Gurney sprang from his couch without a moment's delay, and ran as fast as possible round to the side of the hospital opposite to which the Cornwallises' room was. A little group of soldiers and ladies were standing within the shelter, one of the women sobbing unrestrainedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130789">'Good heavens! are you going to leave them there?' Greville cried passionately.'A wounded man and two helpless women in a burning house!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130790">'The roof has fallen, Major,' one of the men replied, 'and there is a sharp fire between us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130791">So there was; they could watch the bullets whistling and whirling through the air between them and the Cornwallises' hut. As the man spoke, several officers came running to the spot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130792">'The Colonel's room?' one asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130793">'Yes, I'm going,' the Major answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130794">'So am I!' and 'So am I!' cried the others.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130795">'No, no; I'll have no married men!' Greville cried decidedly. 'Maude, you may come.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130797">As he spoke he caught up a mattress, and dashed straight across the open space, followed by young Maude, both of them reaching the veranda of the opposite bungalow in safety. There, under the veranda's scanty shelter, they found the two women, who between them had managed to drag Colonel Cornwallis out of the rapidly-burning building. Floss uttered a glad cry as the two men ran round the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130796" n="77     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/>corner, little Mrs. Cornwallis breaking into a passionate torrent of tears.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130798">'Maude, you are less than I,' Major Gurney said hurriedly, when they found the ladies were still unhurt; 'take Mrs. Cornwallis; she is the least. Put your arm round Maude's throat, Mrs. Cornwallis, and try your best to keep behind the shelter of the mattress.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130799">'I won't leave Bruce,' the little woman announced. 'You must take him first.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130800">'Nonsense! do as we tell you'—imperatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130801">'I won't!'—sitting down by her husband and taking his hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130802">'You must!' said the Major firmly. 'Colonel, will you use your influence?'—bending over him tenderly. 'Mrs. Cornwallis objects to leaving you, but we will come back for you when they are in safety.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130803">'Go, my darling,' said the Colonel faintly; 'but kiss me first.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130804">Vi bent over to do his bidding, and did what was, perhaps, the best thing she could possibly do under the circumstances—fainted away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130805">'That's better,' muttered Greville. 'Pick her up, Maude, and run off with her. Stay, have your mattress so'—tearing a long hole in the cover for the young man to pass his arm through.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130806">'Now, Floss, trust yourself perfectly to me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130807">'No, no; I'm heavy,' she answered. 'I can run, you've no idea how fast; and I'll slip this long skirt off, and surely between us we can carry Bruce across.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130808">'Nonsense! I must take you myself,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130809">'Well, then, here is the mattress Bruce was on when we dragged him out; let me take that and go by myself; I'm not afraid. Oh, Major Gurney, what is the matter with Bruce? Is he dead?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130810">'Fainted,' he returned briefly; 'all the better for my purpose. If you're not going to take that skirt, I will use it as a sling, and regularly hang him round my neck—so.' Then, having slipped the long muslin skirt under the Colonel's knees, and tied a knot ready to slip over his head, he turned to Floss: 'I must see you off first, darling.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130811">'I am ready when you tell me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130812">Major Gurney arranged the mattress to the best advantage and led her to the corner.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130813" n="78     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130814">'Floss,' he said hoarsely, taking her by the hand, and bending his face down to hers, 'will you kiss me before you go? And if I get hurt—for I shall have a good weight to carry'—looking doubtfully at the unconscious form beside them—' I shall know if you cared or not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130815">'Yes, dear,' Floss answered simply, holding up her face to his.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130816">'Now go,' he said quietly—'go at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130817">Floss Bannister turned her soft dark eyes upon his in silence, and, with that one look, ran boldly round the corner, and was lost to view.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130818">'Alone?' cried a dozen eager voices, as she gained the opposite veranda. 'Why, where's Gurney?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130819">'Bringing the Colonel,' Floss replied, at which poor Vi's tears broke out anew—tears of gratitude those.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130820">'Where's Mr. Maude?' Floss asked, looking round.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130821">'Shot in the shoulder; Dr. Moss is attending to him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130822">'All my fault,' Vi sobbed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130823">'Hush! here he is'—as Greville Gurney left the shelter of the opposite building, staggering under the heavy weight of the still unconscious Colonel, yet keeping to his task bravely, and holding his slender cover as best he could between them and the enemy's fire.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130824">'He'll do it!' cried one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130825">'Somebody run out and help him,' said another. 'Let me go.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130826">'No, no, Jack!' cried an anxious wife, holding him back.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130827">'Let him alone,' put in another, with his arm in a sling; 'he'll manage it best alone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130828">'He's shot!' Floss screamed; 'I saw it. Oh! I tell you I saw it. I saw him stagger.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130829">'No, no; it was the chief's weight.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130830">'I don't know; he's very shaky. Now, put your hand out; I've only one. Ah! here he is. Bravo! well done!'—as the Major reached the shelter, and a dozen hands were ready to relieve him of his burden. ' Hold up a moment, man, till we get it off'—trying, with his left hand, to free the Major's throat from the muslin sling.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130831">'I can't,' he gasped, sinking on his knees.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130832">'Hallo!'—forgetting his shattered arm in his effort to hold him up. 'You're not hurt, surely?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130833">I'm done for,' Greville said faintly. 'Did she get in safe?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130834" n="79     THE HERO OF THE REGIMENT."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130835">Mrs. Cornwallis, with an ingratitude for which she may surely be forgiven, had flown to her husband's side, and left his deliverer unheeded; but Floss, with a face so white and eyes so filled with pain that the little group stood aside to let her pass, came swiftly beside him, and lifted his head upon her arm.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130836">'I am here,' she said softly. 'The doctor will be with us in a moment.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130837">'No use, dear; it's all up,' he gasped—'got a bullet through my lungs.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130838">'Don't talk,' she said imperatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130839">'Make—no difference, and there are some things I must say. Floss, if all this trouble had never been, would my love have been of any good? Would you ever have loved me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130840">For one moment she raised her eyes to the sorrowful, sympathetic faces round them; then she answered clearly:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130841">'If it pleases God to take you from me, I will come to you in heaven—Floss Bannister still.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130842">'Thank you, dearest. No, don't touch me, doctor—no use.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130843">'My dear fellow, we cannot tell that till I have looked at you,' the surgeon said kindly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130844">'No use; it will be over in a minute or two now. Floss, if ever you come across any of the old 52nd, tell them I am sorry now I did not make myself more to them; that I thought of them all kindly at the last.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130845">'Yes, I'll tell them,' Floss answered, in a strangely far-off sounding voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130846">'I dare say they've forgotten all the old quarrels now,' he said faintly. Then, after a long silence: 'Still there, Floss?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130847">'Still here, darling.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130848">He smiled at her words, and felt blindly for her hand. His breathing grew more laboured, his face more deadly pale. Then a sudden glad light flooded into his blue eyes, the smile on his lips deepened, and he tried to speak again. But the effort only ended in a crimson stain upon the kerchief Floss held to his lips, followed by a sigh and a shiver, and Greville Gurney lay dead, with his face turned up to the brilliant Indian sky, surely one of the grandest heroes that ever Queen regiment boasted of. And beside him lay Floss Bannister, in the blessed unconsciousness which sometimes comes to lull our keenest agonies, for a little while, to rest.</p><milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130849" n="80     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130850">It was months later that Geoffry Maude, writing to Stephen Thorold, gave, at Floss Bannister's desire, Greville Gurney's last message to his old comrades, and Mrs. Stephen, with tears in her soft eyes, read the letter to such of the regiment as had assembled in her drawing-room that Sunday afternoon for tea and chat. It was received in silence, more than one hardy soldier turning away to hide the emotion he was ashamed to show. Alys O'Shaughnassy had hidden her face against her husband's arm, but little Mrs. St. Hilary looked up bravely, though there was an ominous glitter of tears in her large eyes, and a piteous quivering about her mouth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130851">'I always liked him,' she said, trying hard to steady her voice, 'I <hi rend="italic">always</hi> liked him, and I'm sorry I bore malice so long. So are you, Alys, I know; but he was a gentleman and a brave soldier, and he will have forgiven us. He has come out in his true character—that of a chivalrous hero; and now that he has gone where mistakes and resentment have no place, he will surely know how deeply we regret him, how any ill-feeling there may have been between him and us blotted out by the glorious way in which he has shown us all how duty may be done!' And then the little woman broke into a passionate torrent of tears.</p></div></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_310" n="5" type="story"><head>THE ORDEAL BY PAINT;<lb/>OR, MY FIRST DAY IN THE REGIMENT.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130852">'Here he comes!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130853">'By Gad, so he does! Hurrah! Some sport to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130854">'Looks rather pale, doesn't he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130855">'Yes, and will want a good deal of setting up, too.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130856">'Poor devil! I pity him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130857">As I was not at all afflicted—in that instance I might have said blessed—with deafness, these were a few of the remarks I could not help hearing, as I drove up to the officers' mess of the cavalry barracks at Colchester, where I had come to join the regiment, to which I had been gazetted a couple of months before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130859">Quite unwittingly, I had chosen a very poor time for presenting myself. 'Mid-day stables' were just over, and almost all the officers of the regiment were waiting about the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130858" n="81     THE ORDEAL BY PAINT."/>veranda till luncheon should be ready. They were none of them in very amiable tempers; for they had just heard in the office that a letter had come down for them to hold themselves in readiness to march to the autumn manœuvres at Aldershot, and Aldershot is, as most people know, a spot no cavalry officer rejoices to find himself near, even when there are no Manœuvres going on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130860">Anything more uncomfortable than were my feelings that morning could not be easily imagined. I had never met my regiment before. I knew none of the men, and I was quite at a loss to know to whom I must address myself. However, I was compelled to act; and stumbling out of the cab, with my heart in my throat and great beads of perspiration breaking out upon my forehead, I stood for a moment while my future comrades inspected me, as if I were a polo pony for sale.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130861">My hesitation lasted but an instant. I chose my man, an elderly, rather good-looking officer, with a bald head and well-waxed moustache; so, with a ghastly grin, I blurted out:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130862">'I've come to join.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130863">'Oh, have you?' said he carelessly, and with an expression of
intense amusement on his face. 'Your name's Winter, I suppose? Oh, all
right. Come along with me, and I'll introduce you to the Colonel. I
think you have not met him yet?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130864">No,' I answered, beginning to feel a little more at my ease.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130865">'Wait a moment; I'll just make you acquainted with these fellows first.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130866">This terrible ordeal over, I was hustled off by my elderly friend to be presented to the Colonel, whom we found sitting in the office with his Adjutant making arrangements for the coming manœuvre.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130867">'I've brought Mr. Winter to see you, sir. He's come to Join,' said my guide.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130868">'Ah, how are you?' said the Colonel. 'I'm very glad to see you, for we're rather short of subalterns, and every audition is as great help. Have you got your uniform and that sort of thing? I hope you'll like your work. Are you fond of riding?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130870">I answered modestly that I was, but I was afraid my experience in that line was rather limited. As I spoke, a few riding-school anecdotes began to crop up in my mind; for during the two last months every man I had met seemed to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130869" n="82     CAVALRY LIFE"/>
consider it his duty to impress upon me the fact that a riding-school is neither more nor less than a second <hi rend="italic">inferno</hi>.
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130871">'Brought any hunters down with you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130872">'No, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130873">'Umph! A pity! This is a fair hunting district. However, those are little additions easily made, and I've no doubt you'll soon fall into the ways of the regiment. You'll find your brother officers quite ready to help you in anything so far as sport is concerned.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130874">Of a truth I did; for as soon as it became known that was anxious to buy a hunter, there was scarcely an officer in the regiment who was not anxious to sell me one, 'perfectly sound, and quite good enough to win a steeplechase.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130875">My interview with the Colonel over, I was taken by my elderly friend to have lunch. On the way to the mess-room we met an officer, who seemed to me very old to be still in the army.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130876">'Here's old Muggins, the riding-master,' said my guide, whom I afterwards found was called 'the Fossil,' on account of his antique appearance. 'Well, Muggins, this is Mr. Winter, just joined.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130877">'Ho!' said Mr. Muggins. 'Glad to sec you. Fond of riding? Hey?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130878">I returned the same answer that I had given to the Colonel on that subject, and Mr. Muggins grinned—a grin which somehow reminded me of a cat playing with a mouse.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130879">'Ho, my boy,' said he, 'don't know much about it, don't you? Well, we'll soon tickle you hup a bit. Hey, Moore?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130880">'Yes, I dare say,' in rather a bored tone. 'Come along, Winter. Beastly old cad, Muggins!' he burst out, as soon as we were out of earshot. 'Always sneaking about and getting the young chaps into trouble, except they happen to he willing to bribe him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130881">At lunch I was posted next to a young subaltern of about six months' service, who, having himself just got over the rough part of joining, thought it his bounden duty to 'swagger' over me. He was a babyish-looking, flaxen-haired cornet, with about as much hair on his upper lip as you might find upon that of a boy of twelve. He went—as I very soon heard, in spite of my fright—by the name of 'the Boy,' occasionally varied by that of 'the Brat.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130882">'Ah! which is your county?' drawled this youngster, quite affecting the old soldier.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130883" n="83     THE ORDEAL BY PAINT."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130884">'Devon,' said I, trying in vain to swallow a lump of cutlet which had found its way into my mouth; how, I was really too much excited to know, for I was painfully aware every eye in the room was upon me.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130885">'Ah! any hounds down there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130886">'Oh yes, I think so,' I stammered, being in too much of a 'funk' to know, or, rather, remember, whether there were or not.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130887">'Ah!' said my young Cornet. And there our conversation ended, and I was thus enabled to hear a little of what was going on at the other end of the room; for two or three fellows, who had finished their lunch, had left the table, and were standing in a group on the hearthrug.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130888">'I should like to buy that chap at my valuation, and sell him at his own,' said one. 'I'm rather hard up, and a profit might help me a bit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130889">'What a rum way the young beggar pronounces his <hi rend="italic">h'</hi>s!' said a second, taking no notice whatever of the previous remark.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130890">'Ah!' put in a third. 'Yes, poor devil! Probably he's only just learned them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130891">'Not much to look at, is he?' said the first one, following up his own train of thought.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130892">It may easily be imagined that these remarks did not tend to cure my extreme nervousness, which was evidently taken for 'swagger.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130893">After I had finished, or pretended to finish, some lunch, during which I managed to capsize a tumbler of beer half into my plate, and half over the table, I was shown my room by the boy of tender years, who, being junior, was told off to look after me and set me straight a bit.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130894">My room proved to be about thirteen feet square by eleven high, and there I found two men busily engaged in unpacking my furniture, which had been sent down from town the day before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130895">Amongst a great number of deficiencies, I found I had forgotten to buy sheets for my bed; but, luckily, one of the men, who was servant to another officer, managed to borrow a pair for me until I could get some sent up from the town.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130897">In course of an hour or two my room was put into something like order; and, just as the men were leaving, I asked how my luggage had got there, and who had paid for my cab. They told me that they had done so, having rescued my boxes <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130896" n="84     CAVALRY LIFE"/>from a lot of young officers, anxious, I dare say, to discover where I had bought my uniform, belts, boots, and, indeed, everything I possessed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130898">In my gratitude for their thoughtfulness, I inquired how much they had paid the cabman, magnanimously intending to double it when I repaid them. The price they named, however, entirely precluded the possibility of this; in fact, it was so large that it would, I thought, have been sufficient to buy the cab itself, horse, man and all, out and out. One on the men informed me that he had been ordered to look after, me until I had got a servant of my own, and that he would return at half-past seven to dress me for dinner. As there was only about an hour to spare, I got out some writing materials and wrote a letter to my father. Then I lay down upon my new bed until half-past seven should arrive.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130899">I think I must have fallen asleep, for I remember nothing until I heard a loud 'jar-r-r-r-at' at my door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130900">'Come in!' I cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130901">'It's half-past seven, sir, and I've brought you some hot water and your uniform; but I can't find no mess-waistcoat, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130902">'The devil!' I ejaculated, remembering suddenly that my tailor had told me the day before that it still required a little pressing, but should be sent down that night without fail—a promise he had, of course, taken infinite pains not to keep.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130903">'Perhaps I can borrow one for you, sir,' suggested Robinson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130904">'For goodness' sake go and try,' I said eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130905">He left on the table a letter, which I immediately opened, and found it was an invitation from the Colonel and officers of the regiment to dine. Not knowing the custom of the service, I at once set that down as 'chaff', and the idea of answering it never once entered my head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130906">In about five minutes Robinson returned, with a dilapidated article, which I almost failed to recognise as a cavalry mess-waistcoast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130907">'I am not going to put that thing on!' I said, with much indignation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130908">Robinson, however, assured me that, even if I had it, it would be useless to wear anything better; for the 400th Foot, who were quartered on the opposite side of the town, were to dine with the 52nd Dragoons that night, and there was sure to be some extra rough work going on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130910">When my dressing was complete, I found, as everyone <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130909" n="85     THE ORDEAL BY PAINT."/>does on joining, that my uniform did not fit as it seemed to do in the tailor's shop. My overalls were too loose and baggy, and not high enough in the waist. Indeed, it was only by strapping them up till I thought they would crack that I managed to make the top of the overalls and the bottom of the waistcoat meet at all. The borrowed waistcoat, too, was so tight and uncomfortable about the neck that I thought if I could persuade anything more solid than soup or champagne to pass down my throat that night, I should be extremely lucky.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130911">At last I was ready, and compelled to betake myself off in spite of the utter discomfort I was in. It was wonderful how I missed the tails of my ordinary evening coat; and I went down the steps—one could hardly call them stairs—and along the veranda into the anteroom, feeling as if I had suddenly been transformed into an exceedingly long-legged Manx cat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130912">Here I found a couple of waiters busily handing sherry-and-bitters to a room full of officers, some of whom, from the difference in their uniform, must, I knew, belong to the 400th. I approached one of the latter in a very deferential spirit, and had certainly not said a dozen words before he remarked,' Ah, I suppose you've just joined!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130913">This was a fact which I was most anxious to conceal, and the same sort of feeling crept over me which I should fancy comes over a man suddenly convicted of theft. I thought further parley with him would be useless, as he would be sure to laugh at everything I said, so I left him, and sat down in a corner by myself until dinner was announced.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130914">Being a guest, I was allowed to pass in amongst the first few, and had the pleasure of sitting next Major Silver, a man devoted to hunting, and never happy except in the pursuit of that sport, or when talking of long runs, hunters, and hounds. Now, as I wasn't very well versed in that line, we bored each other terribly, and I was glad when he transferred his conversation from me to his right-hand neighbour, and I was left alone. I was very tired with unpacking; the dinner was so long, and the ready banter and chaff so bewildering, that once or twice it was as much as I could do to keep myself from failing asleep—an achievement which, if I had indulged in it, would have probably been attended by very serious consequences, and of which, so long as I remained in the army, I should never have heard the end.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130916">Happily, however, dinner could not last all night, and at <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130915" n="86     CAVALRY LIFE"/>eleven o'clock the Colonel and Major, with some of the senior 400th guests, rose and went into the anteroom. I was following them, at a very respectful distance, when—whirr, squash!—against the back of my head came an over-ripe orange, which sent me flying, as I thought for a moment, into another world. I turned as quickly as I could to see who had thrown it, but not a man was out of his place; there was not a smile upon a single lip. One of them, however, asked me to come back and have another glass of champagne before I went to bed. So I returned, and had the pleasure of a glass of wine with a man called Burroughes, the senior Subaltern, and a wild harum-scarum sort of fellow, as I afterwards found to my cost.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130917">This glass was followed by another and another and another, with first this and then that member of the mess, and, as the order of the night was no 'heel-taps,' I began to think that the best thing I could do would be to slip away and be off to bed. So five minutes afterwards, little thinking how eagerly my brother officers were awaiting this event, and fondly imagining they were all too much occupied to take any notice of me or my exit, I quietly went to bed. In ten minutes I was sound asleep; but how long that sleep lasted I cannot say. I only know that I had a terrible dream, for I thought I had fallen into the hyena's den at the Zoological Gardens, and then I awoke. There was such a yelling and shouting and holloaing at the foot of my stairs that at first I feared there must be a fire or something of that sort. I soon discovered that the sounds were approaching my door with startling rapidity; and then, catching the sound of my own name, I knew instinctively that they were seeking me, and meant me no good.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130918">My first idea was that the best thing I could do would be to jump out of bed and slip on a smoking-suit or dressing-gown, and pretend I hadn't been to bed at all; but, on consideration, I thought I would stick to my bed and feign sound sleep. I was fool enough to imagine that perhaps, if they found me asleep, they might go away. Poor deluded Cornet Winter!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130919">My heart had given a tremendous jump when I first heard them; and as they came nearer and nearer, so it got higher and higher, until by the time they reached my door it was fairly in my mouth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130920">'Has he locked the door?' I heard a voice say.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_130921" n="87     THE ORDEAL BY PAINT."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_130922">'Yes, rather.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130923">'Oh, capital!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130924">What could that mean?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130925">'Go on, somebody.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130926">In two minutes my door gave way, and about a dozen officers came rolling and tumbling over each other into the room. Then a voice, which I recognised as Burroughes', called out:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130927">'Winter!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130928">No reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130929">'Winter!' This time a little louder.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130930">Still no answer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130931">'Young devil's shamming! Pull him out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130932">Thereupon one or two seized the bar at the head of my bed, while as many others took hold of that at the foot, and they completely overturned me on to the floor, where I lay quite helpless with fright. Two young fellows immediately lifted me up, and, in spite of my urgent protests, conducted me downstairs to the anteroom, a prisoner of war, and dressed exactly as I had tumbled out of bed, with the addition of a pouch-belt and girdle, which they put on over my night-shirt to give me a martial bearing, as they termed it. I found that the anteroom table had been completely cleared of the newspapers, which were usually scattered upon it, and five chairs had been placed round it. In front of each were put blue paper, pens, and ink. I grew more and more frightened when I found I was to be tried by court-martial for a great and heinous offence committed against Her Majesty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130933">Burroughes did not waste a moment in taking his seat at the table as president of the court-martial, and the other four were quickly filled in by junior officers. A sixth was appointed prosecutor; two were announced as witnesses, and three were told off as a guard, one of them being promoted to the rank of corporal of the guard in charge of the prisoner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130935">The charges were then read as follows: 1. Conduct prejudicial to the maintenance of good order and discipline on the part of John Strange Winter, Cornet of the 52nd Dragoons, in having, at Colchester, on the night of the 10th of July, 18—gone to bed, whilst several guests, officers of another regiment, remained in the anteroom—it being the duty of John Strange Winter, Cornet, to entertain them. 2. Conduct unbecoming a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130934" n="88     CAVALRY LIFE"/>Subaltern in going to bed whilst senior officers remained in the anteroom.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130936">I was then placed at the foot of the table between my escort, one of whom shouldered a pair of tongs and the other a shovel, whilst the corporal of the guard was armed with a poker, wherewith he every now and then gave me a dig behind, if I did not stand bolt upright at 'attention'.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130937">I was asked if I objected to be tried by any of the officers whom I saw at the table, and on receiving my answer in the negative, the oath was read.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130938">'You shall well and truly try and determine the case according to the evidence in the matter now before you, so help you, Jorrocks,' etc.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130939">This was taken in due form, and with the utmost gravity, 'Handley Cross' being, I believe, the book used; and the trial proceeded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130940">Lieutenant Bates, on being duly sworn, stated:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130941">'Sir, at Colchester Barracks, on the night of July 10, 18—, I saw the prisoner now before the court-martial sneak off to bed about half-past eleven. There were several guests, officers of another regiment, still remaining in the anteroom. I was also present when the prisoner was arrested in his own room.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130942">Lieutenant Cavasson, being duly sworn, stated:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130943">'Sir, I was in the mess-room when the prisoner went to bed. There were several captains and other senior officers still in the room.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130944">This closed the evidence for the prosecution, and the question was put to me:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130945">'Have you anything to urge in your defence?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130946">I told them in a tremulous voice that I really was very tired, that I did not dream that I was committing an outrageous offence, and that I wouldn't do it again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130947">Then I was conducted out of the room whilst the court considered its sentence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130949">Whilst we were waiting outside, my guards, with the witnesses and junior officers, amused themselves and terrified me by relating previous sentences, and wondering what I should get. It was awfully cold waiting about, for, although it was midsummer and very hot in the day, yet, in the small hours of the night, to wait ten minutes in a draughty hall, with no more clothing than a nightshirt and a pouch-belt, is a very different <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130948" n="89     THE ORDEAL BY PAINT."/> 
matter. At last we were summoned within, and I was led to my place at the foot of the table. Lieutenant Burroughes broke the silence:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130950">'John Strange Winter, you have been found guilty of two very glaring and very heinous offences, and this court has adjudged that you receive two strokes from a birch-rod from every member of the mess now present. I hope it may be a warning to you for the future.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130951">This announcement was received by my tormentors with a ringing cheer. I was ready to sink with fright when I saw the birch produced, and rough hands were laid upon me. My guard with the tongs, although apparently the roughest of the lot, whispered to me to 'hold my jaw, and neither struggle nor cry out'; and something in the kindly voice told me his advice was good, so I took it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130952">The castigation was mere child's play, except when it came to Burroughes' turn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130953">'Ah, this won't do,' I heard him say; 'we shall have the young beggar laughing in his sleeve at us. We really must show him that there is something like discipline in the regiment.' And he certainly did.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130954">'Well, come now,' said that stern gentleman, when my punishment was over, 'the young one's plucky, at all events.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130955">If my brother officers had administered necessary strictness, I certainly could not complain of the way in which I was treated afterwards, for they carried me off into the mess-room, where we found a supper of grilled bones and devilled kidneys, and so forth, spread upon the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130956">When we had eaten and drunken, I was ordered to mount the brass and sing a song. The 'brass' was a square piece of that metal formed by the meeting of the leaves of the table; and a queer figure I must have cut in my scanty attire. They seemed to think so, for they all laughed and cheered heartily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130958">I had the sense to know that a moment's hesitation would be fatal to my popularity, and I dashed at once into the first comic song that came into my head. It was the story of a sailor who got cast away upon an island, taken prisoner by savages, who appropriated his clothes to themselves, finally marrying him to a princess of the royal blood. It was received with uproarious applause; but, unfortunately for me, I did not get to the end without an interruption. I only sang as far as
<pb xml:id="jwcaval_130957" n="90     CAVALRY LIFE"/><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'And there behold me Standing,</l><l>A waistcoat for my clothes,</l><l>A hat and boots, striped red and blue,</l><l>And a ring stuck through my nose,'</l></lg></q>
when, to my dismay, I heard a voice suggesting that it would be all the better if I were dressed in character. The idea caught like wildfire—two pots of paint were produced, whence I know not, and in an incredibly short time I was daubed from head to foot with rings of red and blue paint, and again mounted on the brass to finish my song.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130959">At last the revelries were ended, and I was permitted to go to my room, thoroughly worn out, and half stifled by the disgusting smell and feeling of the paint. Luckily I knew something of art, and had a big bottle of turpentine with me, which, with the help of a palette-knife, brought most of the stuff off.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130960">It was broad daylight ere I sought ray couch, and when at length I fell asleep, it was only to dream it all over again, and to sing in fancy the chorus of my song:</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Jam-see, jee-mee, jabber jee hoy!</l><l>Jabberee, doree, poree,</l><l>Hikey, pikey, sikey, crikey;</l><l>Chilingowoolahbadooree.'</l></lg></q></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_311" n="6" type="story"><head>A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_130962">IT was just a cherub's face under a forage-cap which met Colonel Cotherstone's angry gaze, as he sat bolt upright in his chair one Saturday afternoon. A cherub's face, smooth and fair, which had as yet not the faintest signs of a moustache; a face with languishing azure eyes that went straight to Colonel Cotherstone's heart, in spite of his anger and the popular belief that he was in the fortunate possession of a lump of adamant instead of that too frequently inconvenient organ. The scene was the Colonel's quarters in the Cavalry Barracks at York; the time between three and four in the afternoon; <hi rend="italic">dramatist personœ:</hi> Colonel Edward le Gendre Cotherstone, Sergeant Major McAllister, and Private Edward Jones, F Troop. It was Private Edward Jones who owned the cherub's face, the languishing blue eyes, eyes, the long lithe limbs, and, alas! also a bad character. The description would not have applied at all <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130961" n="91     A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP"/>to the chief, who was largely made and stalwart, with a sunburnt, rugged face, and hair plentifully besprinkled with gray. Nor would it have done, either, for the sergeant-major, who, while owning the most irreproachable character, was fat and bald, and, moreover, did not possess a good feature on his broad red countenance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130963">'Sergeant-major, you can go,' said Colonel Cotherstone curtly; whereupon that personage, having saluted, departed, feeling pretty sure that Private Jones was coming in for a severe wigging, or, as he put it, 'The Colonel's going to give it 'im proper.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130964">But Colonel Cotherstone did not immediately set about the task which he had imposed upon himself. An obstacle, not very often coming between commanding officers and their troopers, presented itself in the shape of that dainty cherub face, with the fair waving hair and the languishing azure eyes, so like another face that he had known long ago <hi rend="italic">and loved!</hi> At last, however, he forced himself to speak.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130965">'And how long is this state of things to continue?' he demanded sternly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130966">Private Jones maintained a discreet silence, but he shifted his long legs nervously, and lowered his eyes until the Colonel could no longer see them. Once their gaze withdrawn from him, he was able to speak fluently enough. Usually Colonel Cotherstone did not find himself at a loss for words.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130967">'Now, look here, Jones,' he said kindly, yet with sufficient firmness to make his words impressive, 'we must have a change. Almost every day I hear of some fresh misdemeanour: idleness, insubordination, work half done or left undone altogether, infringement of rules, absence without leave. What is the end to be?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130968">Private Jones shot one swift glance at his chiefs keen angry face, opened his mouth as if to speak, but ended by remaining silent; the Colonel, however, continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130970">'By what chain of circumstances you came to enlist I don't know; but if you imagined for an instant that your birth would permit you to ride rough-shod over everything, why, you made a mistake. Because you are a gentleman, because you can speak half a dozen languages, because you have got through your fortune and made an utter fool of yourself, you cannot be excused your duties or have your misdoings passed over without punishment. I dare say it's hard for you to be restricted, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130969" n="92     CAVALRY LIFE"/>to obey the non-commissioned officers, to turn out of your bed at five o'clock, to live with men of a different rank from your own; but you should have considered all that before you brought yourself down to your present position. With your advantages of education, you might get your commission in the course of a few years, and win back the position you have lost; but whilst your present bad conduct continues, I can do nothing for you. I cannot pass you over the heads of men who do their duty conscientiously, men whom I can trust. If you do not choose to alter your present ways, you must make up your mind to remain a private always; there is no favouritism in the army. You have now been five months in the regiment, and those five months you have utterly wasted, always shielding yourself behind the fact that by birth you are a gentleman—by birth and by education. I tell you, sir, those two facts are a disgrace to you, simply a disgrace, instead of a blessing and an honour. As yet I have kept you out of the degradation of the cells; but I find that punishment by fines is of no avail—the punishment of a fine simply falls upon your mother.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130971">Private Jones lifted his face, all crimsoned by shamed blushes, and repeated Colonel Cotherstone's concluding words,</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130972">'My mother, sir?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130973">'Your mother, sir,' returned the chief sternly. 'If you have no consideration for your family, for yourself, for the honour of your old name; no shame at the contempt of your officers, no dread of what the end of all this will be, does the thought of the mother who bore you never cross your mind?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130974">The lad turned away in confused silence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130975">'Answer me!' thundered the chief.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130976">He spoke then for the first time, spoke in such a soft, drawling voice that Colonel</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130977">Cotherstone absolutely shivered, it was so like that other voice:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130978">'Yes, sir, I do; only it is so hard'—with a heavy sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130979">'What is so hard—your work?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130980">'No, sir; I don't know that I find the work so bad. I could always groom a horse well, and the stable-work I soon got used to. And I don't mind the men—they're rough, but they're good-natured, most of them; but it's the non-commissioned officers—I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> stand them, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130981">'Why not?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130983">'I can do with old McAllister, sir,' said the lad eagerly, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130982" n="93     A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP"/>almost forgetting his drawl; 'but the sergeants in F Troop—O Lord!'—with another sigh. 'If I please one, I displease another. It's having so many masters, and each thinks he has a right to bully me as hard as he likes. Because they've got a few shillings' worth of gold lace on their jackets, I suppose.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130984">'Which they have won by their own good conduct,' rejoined the Colonel. 'I'll tell you what it is, Hamilton: you're a young fool, with only a little further to go in the direction you're in to find yourself at the devil.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130985">'You know me, sir,' the lad gasped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130986">'I knew your—people,' answered the Colonel curtly. He had almost said 'your mother,' but changed the word in time to 'people'; 'and for your name's sake—not for your own, mind—I will give you one more chance. If I move you out of F Troop into Sergeant-Major McAllister's, will you give me your word to try and reform?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130987">The crimson tide flushed anew over the lad's fair face; a rush of feeling—could that darkness be tears?—flooded into his azure eyes. He forgot that he was only Private Jones, and that the tall man with the stern, bronzed face before him was that awe-inspiring being 'the commanding officer,' Colonel Cotherstone, one of the strictest martinets in the service—he forgot it all. He only remembered that he was Hamilton of Glenbarry, and that this was the first real kindness, except old McAllister's, that he had met with for months. In the impulse of the moment he held out his hand, and said heartily:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130988">'I'll try, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130989">Colonel Cotherstone just laid his fingers in the outstretched hand for a moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130990">'Very well, Hamilton, I'll take your word,' he replied gravely. ' Now you can go.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130992">When the door had closed behind the lad, Colonel Cotherstone sat down again in his armchair and tried to think. But think he could not. A vision of a cherub's face under a forage-cap came persistently between him and his thoughts. How many years was it ago that just such a head and face had lingered in his memory—just such a cherub's face, and under a forage-cap? And yet there was a difference. The mother's sweet blue eyes had looked straight into his own, with never a shade of the shame he had seen in those of the son that very day, and the forage-cap from under which the mother's golden <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130991" n="94     CAVALRY LIFE"/>curls had strayed bore the gold band of an officer instead of the simple yellow of the dragoon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130993">He was not altogether easy in his mind, that big, bronzed soldier. He knew that, in spite of his stern words, he had treated Private Jones a great deal too easily, else he would not have sent the sergeant-major away. It is not altogether usual for commanding officers to talk to refractory soldiers as he had talked to Private Jones, and yet——</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130994">'No,' he muttered, 'I couldn't be hard on Mary's boy, who came and looked at me with Mary's eyes, and talked to me with Mary's soft tongue. Poor little Mary!' And straight way his thoughts flew back to the little scene enacted ever so many years ago, and which had been recalled so vividly to his memory that afternoon—a scene of which the principal incident was a cherub's face under a forage-cap.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130995">Naturally, before Edward le Gendre Cotherstone had obtained his regiment, he had held the respective positions of major, captain, lieutenant, and cornet. Well, it was when he was only Cornet Cotherstone, and but two-and-twenty, that he was foolish enough to fall in love.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130996">At that time the Cuirassiers were quartered at Edinburgh, and it was in the Modern Athens that he and his fate met. This was one-and-twenty years before the opening of this story, when Colonel Cotherstone was forty-three, a first-rate soldier, and, considering all things, fairly popular, though his officers, especially the subalterns, quite believed in a theory, now of many years' standing, which declared him to be minus several important internal arrangements, one of which was a heart, the other being the bowels of compassion. He certainly was very hard. They all vowed he had not a single soft spot in his whole composition; but they were wrong. A soft place he had, and the unruly lad with a cherub's face had been lucky enough to find it out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130998">As I said before, Edward le Gendre Cotherstone was two-and-twenty when he fell in love for the first—indeed, the only—time. He was driving along Prince's Street one afternoon, when a small Skye terrier managed to get itself under the horse's heels, and, in addition to that, one of the wheels passed over it. At every period of his life Edward Cotherstone had been as keen as a hawk is popularly supposed to be, and a vision of a golden-haired girl dressed in black, who uttered a piteous cry, and put two little black-gloved hands <pb xml:id="jwcaval_130997" n="95     A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP"/>out to rescue the little animal, who was howling frightfully, caused him to pull up the trap with a jerk, and jump down.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_130999">'Oh, I am sorry!' he said, bending over the little creature, now whining piteously in its young mistress's arms. 'I am so grieved. I hope it's not much hurt.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301000">The girl's blue eyes, half drowned as they were in tears, flashed an indignant glance at him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301001">'wouldn't you be hurt,' she asked bluntly, pointing to the wheel as she spoke, 'if that had gone right over your body?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301002">'What can I do to help you?' he asked, wisely ignoring the question. 'Can I drive you home?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301003">'I live at Portobello, 'she answered helplessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301004">'Please let me drive you there,' he urged. 'Let me hold him whilst you get in, and then I'll lay him ever so carefully on your lap.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301005">And so he had his own way; that was a little peculiarity of Edward Cotherstone's. He took the dog from her with the utmost tenderness and without eliciting a single cry; and when she had mounted into the high trap, he restored it to her gentle keeping. On the way down to Portobello he gathered that the young lady's name was Stewart—Mary Stewart—and that she lived with her grandmother, who did not often go out. She told him, too, that she was seventeen; and that Fluff, the injured Skye, had been given to her by her cousin Hamilton of Glenbarry. She also told him that her father had not been dead many months, and that she had been both to London and Paris. In fact, she was so very communicative that he thought he knew everything there was to be known about her; but, notwithstanding her apparent candour, there was one trifling circumstance which, had she mentioned it, would have spared him many a bitter heartache. She did not mention it, however. He took her to her home, and sent his trap away, as she wished him to examine and determine the full extent of the dog's injuries. He was introduced to the aged grandmother, who took quite a fancy to him by reason of having been at school—goodness knows how many years previously—with his great-aunt. She, too, mentioned Hamilton of Glenbarry, and mentioned him, moreover, in a way which did not show that any large amount of love was lost between them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301007">'He does not always behave very respectfully to grand-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301006" n="96     CAVALRY LIFE"/>mamma,' Mary confided to him in an undertone. 'He calls her "old lady," and she can't bear it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301008">'Confounded cad!' thought Mr. Cotherstone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301009">They found, upon examination, that Fluff was not very much the worse for his accident; and little Miss Stewart was comforted beyond measure when the young Cuirassier assured her that when the bruises had passed off he would be all right again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301010">But, of course, he called next day to ask after Fluff and ascertain if Miss Stewart had recovered from her fright. He was also remarkably attentive to the old lady, and won her heart as easily as he did that of her grand-daughter. For some months this kind of thing continued. Edward Cotherstone grew more and more happy; but little Mary faded somewhat—as does a floweret for lack of water and sunshine. Sometimes she frightened him, she looked so pale, so wan, and fragile; then again, she would brighten when he appeared, and throw him into fresh transports of love and happiness; and so the pretty play went on until it was played out, for one fine morning in June the crash came. He had gone in for half an hour, because he knew Mrs. Stewart would not be visible so early in the day. Mary looked so bright and fresh that the young soldier was tempted to take her in his arms and kiss her, calling her by every fond, endearing name he could think of, telling her over and over again how he loved her—how very, very dearly he loved her, his little Scotch lassie—and a good deal more in the same strain. And Mary, what of her? She never drew back, never whispered the faintest hint of that secret which lay been her and him—the secret which once or twice he had almost stumbled upon. No, she clung to him with an almost despairing passion, which made him feel uneasy, in spite of his happiness. She twined her soft arms round his throat, and cried incredulously:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301011">'Do you realty love me, Eddie?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301012">'Really, my darling,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301013">And then she broke from the clasp of his loving arms almost impatiently, though the love-light still shone in her azure eyes, the dimpling smiles still played about her tender mouth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301015">'I shall try on your cap!' she announced coquettishly; then stuck the golden-bordered little cap on one side of her head, and, turning from the glass, looked at him with passionate love <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301014" n="97     A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP"/>filling her blue eyes—love which she had caught from his. The sound of a carriage stopping without caused her to turn her head, and when she looked at him again the smiles had frozen on her sweet mouth, and a nameless horror had taken the place of the tender light which a moment before was shining in her eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301016">'Oh, my darling, what is it?' the young soldier cried in sudden
affright.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301017">'It is Hamilton of Glenbarry!' she answered in a hoarse whisper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301018">'What is he to you?' Cotherstone cried passionately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301019">' He is my——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301020">'Your what? For God's sake speak, and let me know the worst!' he said fiercely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301021">'He will be my husband,' she answered in a voice almost inaudible.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301022">With almost brutal roughness Cotherstone thrust her away from him, caught up his cap and gloves, and strode out of the house where he had spent such blissful hours, and where, alas! he had had such a bitter blow. And he never saw her again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301023">The following day came a piteous note of explanation—how her father had wished it; how she had given Hamilton the promise to please her father when he was dying; how she had not had courage to tell him earlier, because she had never dreamed he could care for her; how she was very, very unhappy—<hi rend="italic">very</hi> (with a great dash under the adverb, and a woeful blister just below); how, though she must keep her promise, she would love her darling Eddie best all her life long.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301024">And that was the end of it. A few weeks later he saw the announcement of her marriage in the papers, and then he tore her letter up and set himself to forget her. On the whole, he succeeded fairly well. He threw himself heart and soul into is profession, with what result we have seen. He succeeded in making everyone, even himself, believe he was a man of the consistency of stone; and yet when Private Jones—brought in to receive a severe lecture, not for one, but for a dozen misdemeanours—came and looked at him out of Mary's blue eyes, and talked to him in Mary's soft voice, he could not find it in his heart—his adamantine heart—to be hard upon Mary's boy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301026">The vision of the cherub's face under a forage-cap threw <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301025" n="98     CAVALRY LIFE"/>him back with painful distinctness to the time, one-and-twenty years before, when he parted from Mary. He realized that Saturday afternoon in November, that perhaps he had been very hard upon her, poor little soul! He might, at least, have stayed and said a few kind words to the poor little woman, who was bound to a man she hated; that she hated Hamilton there could be no doubt, for the look of loathing and horror which leapt into her eyes as she realized his presence proclaimed her feelings plainly enough. Ah, poor darling!—she had got from ' poor little soul' to 'poor darling'—but he felt now that he had been cruel to her; he might, at least, have answered that heart-broken, despairing letter, and so perhaps have made her lot less hard to bear than probably it was. Well, at all events, he had not been hard upon the boy, that was one consoling point. Boys will go wrong, especially when they have no father to keep them straight. He had suspected all along who Private Jones really was, though until that very afternoon he had not been quite certain. He wondered if a letter to his mother would do any good. She was a widow now, poor soul!—Hamilton had been dead ten years, he knew—and naturally she would be glad to know there was someone who took an interest in her only child—that Mrs. Hamilton of Glenbarry had had but one child Colonel Cotherstone was also aware—and certainly if he wrote a few lines she could not take them amiss, and they might be a comfort to her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301027">And so Colonel Cotherstone sat down to his writing-table to pen an epistle to his old love, Mary Stewart, the mother of that exceedingly wayward young gentleman, Private Edward Jones, F Troop, Cuirassiers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301028">'She called him after me, too,' murmured the commanding officer of the Cuirassiers, as he selected a pen. 'Poor little Mary!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301029">It was easy enough to write 'November 14th' under the printed 'CAVALRY BARRACKS, YORK,' which was already stamped on the paper, but he found the next part scarcely so easy. His most natural impulse was to begin, 'My dear Mary'; yet, when he had written it, he thought it too familiar, so took another sheet. Having put another 'November 14th' at the top, he began, 'My dear Mrs. Hamilton——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301030">'What shall I say next?' he said aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301032">It took him a long time to write that letter; but at last he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301031" n="99     A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP"/>accomplished it. It was not very long, and it was rather stiff. It ran:</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_12017"><body xml:id="jwcaval_12016"><div xml:id="jwcaval_320" type="letter"><opener><salute>'MY DEAR MRS.

Any interest of mine, you may be sure, he will not want.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301034">'Believe me, my dear Mrs. Hamilton,</p><closer><salute>'Most faithfully yours,</salute><signed>'EDWARD LE GENDRE COTHERSTONE.'</signed></closer></div></body></floatingText></q></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301035">That was the letter he wrote and sent. Three days passed, during which he received no reply—a fact which worried him somewhat. On the fourth day, however, he received a note, by hand, from Mrs. Hamilton, asking him to call and see her at the Black Swan Hotel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301036">He happened to be just going out when the note reached him, so he thrust it into his pocket—not without a certain feeling of tenderness at the sight of the dainty delicate characters—and took his way into the town. He did not go very quickly, though; he called at the florist's half-way, and bought a flower for his buttonhole—a white rosebud it was. He met some people that he knew, and stayed to chat with them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301037">But, dawdle as he would, he came to the hotel at last. Everyone who has been in York knows that it is not very far from the Cavalry Barracks to the Black Swan. Colonel Cotherstone went into the hall and asked for Mrs. Hamilton.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301038">'Was Mrs. Hamilton at home?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301039">'Certainly. Would the gentleman step this way?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301040">And so they led him upstairs and ushered him into a room, where, seated by the fire, was a lady—a lady with wavy golden hair, with soft blue eyes, and two little white hands outstretched to greet him—his old love, Mary Stewart.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301041">'How am I to thank you?' she cried. 'I have tried for all these five months to find out what my boy was doing. I couldn't persuade him to come home, and I have been so unhappy about him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301042">'Has he never written to you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301044">'Oh yes; every week regularly. But I did not know that <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301043" n="100     CAVALRY LIFE"/>he was in York. His letters came from London; and the only address was a London post-office. He said he was not in prison, but he couldn't tell me any more.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301045">'No, he has not been in prison,' Colonel Cotherstone answered, smiling, as he thought of the near shaves he had had in that respect.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301046">'I didn't quite understand your letter,' said Mrs. Hamilton presently. ' Why should he be ashamed of the profession he has taken up—too much ashamed even to tell me what it was? Why should he have any restraint placed upon him? Have the other officers so much restraint?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301047">'My dear Mrs. Hamilton, your son has <hi rend="italic">enlisted</hi>,' said the Colonel kindly, wondering at her ignorance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301048">'How enlisted?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301049">'He is not in my regiment as an officer,' he said.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301050">'What! my boy a common soldier?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301051">'A private,' corrected Colonel Cotherstone gently. ' Yes, that is what he is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301052">'My boy,' cried the little woman brokenly—' my boy, Hamilton of Glenbarry, a soldier! Does he have to groom a horse, pray?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301053">'Certainly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301054">'And to do stable-work?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301055">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301056">'Does he have to salute you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301057">Of course.' In spite of himself a smile broke over his face. ' I hope that is not very hard for him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301058">'Not to you,' she said impatiently. 'No one would mind saluting you, of course; but the others! You don't mean to say he is obliged to put his hand up so'—with a ludicrous imitation of a salute—'to all the young subs, to the riding-master, even?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301059">'He certainly has to do so,' answered the Colonel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301060">'Hamilton of Glenbarry salute, touch his hat to a riding-master!' ejaculated Mrs. Hamilton. 'I tell you it is absurd, utterly absurd!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301061">'Whilst he remains in the ranks it must be done,' said the Colonel, smiling still at her vehemence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301062">'Then, he shall not remain in the ranks,' she cried. 'How soon can I have him released?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301063">'Will you take my advice,' he asked, ' and leave him for a few months, or until I advise you to buy him off?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301064" n="101     A CHERUB'S FACE UNDER A FORAGE-CAP"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301065">'You would do what is best for me?' the widow faltered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301066">"You know I would,' touching her hand for a moment. That was a great advance for Colonel Cotherstone; but the old influences were strongly at work in him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301067">'I don't know why you should be so good to me,' she said, rather forlornly. ' I behaved very badly to you, and yet——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301068">'Yet what?' drawing nearer and taking her hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301069">'I was unhappy,' she said simply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301070">They were both standing on the rug—he, a large, fine, upright figure in gray tweed; she, a dainty thing in purple velvet, looking absurdly young to be the mother of Private Jones.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301071">'Why were you unhappy, and when?' he asked, possessing himself of the other hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301072">'When you went away, and—and because—I——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301073">'Well?' he asked eagerly. 'Because you——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301074">'Because I loved you so,' she said, hiding her face upon his breast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301075">If Colonel Cotherstone's dream of love was rudely interrupted one-and-twenty years before, when, on that June morning, Hamilton of Glenbarry turned up so inopportunely, he made up for it when he found his little love in the hotel with the sign of the Black Swan at York. It would be hard to say who was the most surprised at the event which followed, or, rather, at the announcement of it. I doubt whether the officers, when, the next evening after dinner, their chief announced that he was going to be married, were as thoroughly surprised as was Ned Hamilton, when, a free man again, he entered his mother's room at the Black Swan; and I am perfectly certain that his astonishment did not equal that of his mother when she found how faithfully Edward Cotherstone had loved her all those years. Perhaps the most thoroughly amazed of them all was Colonel Cotherstone himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301076">To the intense amusement of the whole regiment, his wife calls him 'Eddie.' The young ones say that he grew tired of having no heart, so managed to get his brains exchanged for one; but if one of them goes a little wrong in duty, or any other respect, he very quickly finds out that the chief's brain is as keen as ever it was in the days when he was popularly believed to be altogether deficient in certain internal arrangements, of which a heart was one.</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301077" n="102     CAVALRY LIFE"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_050" n="7" type="story"><head>CALCRAFT—A TROOPER.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301078">THE Cotherstones had been married a few months, and were living at a pretty house in the village of Fulford, which lies about half a mile beyond the cavalry barracks at York.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301079">Mrs. Cotherstone was standing at the window of the dining-room, watching for her husband, and at the same time taking notes of the interesting process of putting a horse into a cab belonging to the inn opposite. Very slow about his job the man was; the straps seemed to get wrong as each one was fastened. The horse was not particularly anxious to expedite the work, and kept shifting his position every moment, at which proceeding the man expressed his disapproval in a series of 'gee-whoops' and 'gerrup-ma-lads,' of which the animal took but small notice. Then he went inside the inn, for a glass of beer, evidently. Mrs. Cotherstone was disgusted. She could, she felt, have put that horse in and been at the house to which it had been ordered in less than half the time that it had taken the man to fasten one strap. She wondered if it was wanted to catch a train. It couldn't be for a wedding—it was after one o'clock; then, but to be sure, it might be wanted for a funeral! She drummed her little lingers impatiently upon the window-ledge, and wondered indignantly how much longer that man was going to be drinking that glass of beer. Why, she could have drunk half a dozen glasses of beer in that time, she was convinced, though Mrs. Edward le Gendre Cotherstone was not given to beer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301080">Then a <hi rend="italic">divertissement</hi> fortunately came, in the shape of a tall, soldierly figure, in undress, carrying a whip in one hand—a man with a stern, bronzed face, having, just then, a most preoccupied expression. It cleared, however, as he perceived the golden-haired little lady at the window, much as a thunder-cloud disperses before the genial influence of the sun, but not before she had noticed the unwonted darkness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301081">'What is the matter, Ned?' she asked as he entered the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301082">'Oh, nothing particular, my darling,' he answered; 'it is only that poor devil Calcraft again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301083">'Again?' the little woman echoed blankly; 'and after you gave him such a talking to?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301084" n="103     CALCRAFT--A TROOPER"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301085">Her tone implied that, since the Colonel had taken the trouble to give Calcraft a 'talking to,' his gratitude ought to have induced him, from that time forth, to become a model of good conduct and amiability.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301086">'It isn't all his fault,' said the Colonel; 'but he is quick-witted and sharp-tongued—the two qualities often go together— and somehow he has contrived to get out of his serjeant-major's good graces; you know what that means?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301087">'Bullying, I suppose.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301088">'Bullying is rather a mild general term for it,' Colonel Cotherstone answered. 'In detail it means nagging, continual fault-finding, swearing at, reporting—that is one side. On the other it means never doing right, always doing wrong, always being late, never being clean enough, everlastingly breaking or infringing rules, being perpetually goaded to the verge of madness, being taunted, scorned, made nothing of; and, like a boil, matters generally come to a head; they have come to a very decided head in Calcraft's case, poor devil!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301089">'Well?' said Mrs. Cotherstone in a tone implying that he was to continue his story.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301090">'He is rather a favourite of Dickson's; he is in Dickson's troop, you know. He has looked after him as well as he could, but what can an officer do under such circumstances? Next to nothing; and this morning the crash has come. Serjeant-Major Lucas and his wife live at the end of a veranda, which Calcraft has to pass every morning with a big bucket of cold water, and, being an awfully hot night, they had left their window wide open. It seems that this morning Lucas hadn't turned out so early as he ought to have done, not by an hour or more, and as Calcraft passed along the veranda with his bucket of water, some fiend whispered into his ear that the water was very cold, and the window was wide open, and that the Lucases' bed stood immediately beneath it. Of course it was all done in a moment, and Calcraft took to his heels, and then there seems to have been a royal row. Calcraft, the usual scapegrace, was accused, and was marched off to the cells, poor beggar! to await a trial by court-martial, However, there's one thing I can and will do. I can't save Calcraft, but, by George! I'll be down upon Lucas for being late.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301092">'Can't you get Calcraft off'' Mrs. Cotherstone asked in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301091" n="104     CAVALRY LIFE"/>a voice choking with laughter, and wiping the tears from her eyes as she spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301093">'Utterly impossible,' he returned decidedly; 'a court-martial must go by evidence, not by private favour.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301094">'I shall give him a sovereign for himself when I see him' Mrs. Cotherstone announced. If anyone had made such a startling proposal to Colonel Cotherstone a year previously, he would have positively jumped off his seat with horror, and expressed his opinion that such a proceeding would infallibly send the service to the dogs in no time; but on the present occasion he merely possessed himself of one of Mary's little delicate hands, and, with an indulgent laugh, told her she must keep her doings to herself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301095">'Don't let me know anything about it, for it won't do to have it said that I encourage insubordination in the regiment.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301096">Some of my readers may have seen the interior of a barrack-cell. Such will know that they are not pleasant places. Those who have never entered one must take my word for it Private Calcraft knew them well, and each experience he had of them he found them less to his taste. During that brilliant summer day he sat pondering over the fate which had led him into disfavour with Sergeant-Major Lucas. How was it that he hated him so? He was quite sure he had never done anything to merit it; no one else in the whole regiment hated him as Lucas did. I cannot say that he was particularly repentant for what he had done, and there was not a shadow of doubt that he was the culprit, though as yet he had maintained a stolid silence upon the subject; but he found the confinement of his cell irksome, and he would like to have heard what his comrades were saying about his exploit, which would, he knew, be on every tongue in the barracks. Well, he should get it 'proper,' as he put it, for this business, he had no doubt. They were sure to be pretty hard upon him, he so often got into trouble, and of course they would take the sergeant-major's account before his—not that he had any, account to give. He had, as yet, kept quiet, without attempting any explanation, and he thought that would be the best course to adopt, whatever came of the affair; besides, what had he to say?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301098">He leant forward, with his elbows on his knees, and watched a ray of sunshine, which had had sufficient bad taste to weary of the outer world and penetrate, by way of a change, into the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301097" n="105     CALCRAFT--A TROOPER"/>Cell. Calcraft was very glad to see the sunbeam, though it seemed to him that it couldn't have very much sense to come in there, when it might have stayed outside and then he free; and then he fell to wishing that he, too, was free. He wondered how it was that he had borne the tyrant's tyranny so long. Many a man would have made a bolt of it, and trusted to luck that he didn't wake up some fine morning to find himself branded with the letter which would be a shame to him as long as he should live—even to his grave. But no; after all, he wouldn't be such a mean-spirited coward as that. He had fought on for five years, and, come what might, he would fight on a bit longer. Maybe Lucas would be leaving the regiment, or dying, or something of that sort, and then see if he didn't show his officers that he had some good in him, after all! He could just fancy the kindly approval in Captain Dickson's keen blue eyes when he won a good-conduct stripe, or was made corporal. Ay, he would keep up his pluck for a while longer, and try if matters wouldn't mend a bit. Just as he arrived at this satisfactory conclusion, the door of the cell opened, and the object of his thoughts appeared—Captain George Dickson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301099">Calcraft jumped up from his bench, and Captain Dickson sat down upon it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301100">'Well, you've made an awful mess of it this time, Calcraft,' he observed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301101">'Yes, sir,' returned Calcraft with a salute.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301102">'It's no use trying to keep you straight,' the officer observed testily. 'I shall have to give you up altogether.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301103">Calcraft made no reply; hitherto he had exulted much over his exploit, but since it was to cost him the kindliness f his Captain, he began to look at it in quite another light.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301104">'And, by-the-by, Calcraft,' said Captain Dickson suddenly, 'what the dickens were you doing in the veranda at five o'clock?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301105">'Wasn't there, sir,' he replied promptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301106">'Sergeant-Major Lucas says it was striking five as the bucket of water came through the window.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301107">'Then it couldn't be me as threw it, sir,' said Calcraft solemnly; 'for when five o'clock struck by Fulford Church, I was standing just outside the door of F Troop room with private Wells and Corporal Fraser—as they'll both tell you, sir'.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301108" n="106     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301109">'I'll look into the matter,' answered the Captain, rising; 'and, Calcraft, if you should be lucky enough to get over this business, just let it be a warning to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301110">I will, sir,' he said earnestly enough, but whether some expression in his Captain's eyes upset his gravity or not I cannot say, only at that moment his solemn red face relaxed and the hearty laughter came bubbling up to his lips: it might be at the remembrance of the douche-bath which he had so successfully administered to his enemy, and, as he dared not laugh outright, his feelings found a vent in a violent fit of coughing, and Captain Dickson beat a hasty retreat; perhaps he wished to laugh in comfort out of Calcraft's sight.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301111">In due time Calcraft was brought before the court-martial. The sergeant-major told his story glibly enough; in truth, there was not very much to tell.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301112">On the morning of July 10 he was in bed, the window was open at the top, the church clock at Fulford struck five—he was perfectly sure as to the time, because he had compared his watch with it; just as he laid the watch down, a bucketful of water was emptied through the window over the bed. He could not see the face of the man who did it but he saw the hands; he could positively swear to their being the prisoner's hands!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301113">So ended the case for the prosecution. Sergeant-Major Lucas retired with a well-satisfied smile at Calcraft,who returned it with a defiant stare.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301114">Then, greatly to the sergeant-major's astonishment, appeared two witnesses for the prisoner, Corporal Fraser and Private Wells, who both deposed positively to the truth of Calcraft's statement, that at five o'clock on the morning of July 10 he was standing with them at the door of F Troop room. Corporal Fraser also deposed that the prisoner was not out of his sight until half-past five. Accordingly Calcraft was acquitted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301116">Now, Calcraft had made Captain Dickson a distinct promise that, if he should be lucky enough to get over the affair, it should be a warning to him. Therefore, immediately he found himself a free man he at once proceeded to break it. First of all, he informed the nonplussed sergeant-major—who, to save himself from censure for being late, had set the time back a whole hour, and so enabled Calcraft to get off <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301115" n="107     CALCRAFT--A TROOPER"/>scot-free—that the way to catch a bird was by putting salt on its tail, for which valuable information he did not deign even to thank him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301117">Finding that had no effect, Calcraft, like an idiot—as most soldiers are when left to themselves —occupied himself for a week in taking every available opportunity of passing along the veranda in which his enemy's room was situate, singing at the top of his voice the refrain of a little song:
<q><l>'The old, old story was told again,</l><l>At five o'clock in the morning!'</l></q></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301118">Finally he brought matters to a climax by asking if he and 'the missis' had found the water very cold. Flesh and blood could stand it no longer. The sergeant-major went to Captain Dickson and reported that Calcraft had owned to throwing the water. Calcraft denied it, and repeated what had really taken place. Lucas held to his story, and eventually Calcraft's patience—of which he had not at any time a very large stock—gave way, and, in spite of his officer's presence, he rushed at his enemy, and administered a sound drubbing!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301119">That was fatal; there was the tedium of another court-martial. The thrashing—and it was a sound one—counted for a good deal, and the provocation and the bullying, on the other hand, went for next to nothing. Calcraft received the longest sentence which could be given to him, also the prison-crop, and was heard no more of until he was once more free.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301121">August and September slipped away quickly enough to most people, but very slowly indeed to poor Calcraft in his durance vile. The longest period, however, must come to a close, and the darkest night end in morning. His term of imprisonment did come to an end, in time; but as to his night of troubles ending in the morning in peace and quietness, why, that was quite another matter. Calcraft thought his trials and difficulties grew denser. At first he tried hard to keep straight, for he knew if he could but rise to the rank of corporal his enemy's power would be considerably lessened; but, try as he would, it seemed quite impossible for him to succeed. The glorious autumn days passed by, each one finding him sunk a little deeper in the slough of despond, each one leaving him a trifle more wretched than the last, and more passionately desirous of lying down to die in peace. Yes; it had come to that. He had begun to look back to the long, dreary weeks he spent in the cells as a time when <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301120" n="108     CAVALRY LIFE"/>he had known what it was to have peace and rest. He felt himself a disgrace to his regiment, yet they would not let him do any better, and he did try. He fancied—for he had grown morbidly sensitive of late—that when his officers passed him they looked at him with scorn—all fancy, poor fellow! for they never looked at him at all, or bestowed a second thought upon him, though 'Calcraft, poor devil!' was their usual way of speaking of him when they did mention him, and most of them hated Lucas as much as they pitied his victim. Still, a contemptuous pity was not calculated to improve the state of a man on the verge of madness, as Calcraft at that time was; and had it not been for two persons, he would not have borne up as long as he did. Those two persons were the Colonel's golden-haired, gentle little wife and Captain Dickson. For them both Calcraft, in his utter misery, conceived a passionate adoration. First in his poor tormented heart he held the lady. She had carried out her intention, which she had announced to her husband, and on the first opportunity had given Calcraft a sovereign, which he, poor chivalrous fool! had had a ring put through, and slung it to his watch-chain; and whenever she met him her gentle 'Good-morning, Calcraft,' fell upon his ear with such unaccustomed sweetness that he could have flung himself down and kissed her very feet, in gratitude for the kindness which cost her nothing, but which, to him, was the one ray of sunshine which brightened his lot. No, not quite the only ray; he had forgotten Captain Dickson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301122">Towards the end of November Captain Dickson's servant died, and he chose Calcraft to fill his place. Then his troubles lightened somewhat, for he was necessarily less in his enemy's power; but, unfortunately, the partial reprieve had come too late—the evil had gone too far, and he was unable to shake off the effects of the past five years and the continual ill-treatment he had endured—the shame and degradation which had been thrust upon him during the past few months.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301124">Things had gone badly enough with him since the day he joined the regiment; but until that fatal July morning, when he had succumbed to the voice of the fiend which prompted him to pour a pail of water over Mr. and Mrs. Lucas, he had gone on his careless way almost unmindful of anything his enemy might do to torment him. His long term of imprisonment he had endured with a considerable amount of cheerfulness and pluck, expressing his opinion to more persons than <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301123" n="109     CALCRAFT--A TROOPER"/>one that the thrashing he had administered was well worth the after-consequences. Alas! he had not at that time counted upon what was to follow. It surpassed even his ideas of what bullying meant, and he had had considerable experience in that respect, as has been shown. If he had gone into Captain Dickson's service immediately after his release from the cells, he might have been ably to carry out the good resolutions he had formed during his confinement. As it was, the partial reprieve came too late; his spirit was cowed utterly, his aspirations after something nobler were crushed his courage gone. The very appearance of the man was changed; his fearless blue eyes had acquired a wild, unsettled expression, and he seldom looked anyone straight in the face; his face, which had once been of a healthy red, had faded to a sickly pallor, and the flesh had fallen away from his cheeks. He had lost the careless swaggering gait which had once distinguished him, and now seemed to have no energy for anything but sauntering—no, trailing is a better word—trailing about the quaint narrow streets, taking no notice of man, woman, or child. If Captain Dickson happened to be out or was dining at mess, he did not even do that, but stayed in his room—which he had leave to do—being sure there of peace and quietness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301126">The winter days crept on, and Calcraft's spirit sank lower, his despondency increased, his face grew paler, and his air more dejected. Just before Christmas he got a kick from a horse, which laid him up for a fortnight in hospital. A year before he would hardly have noticed it, but, in his weakened state of body and mind, the trifling accident proved more serious! Not that he minded it; he had a happy time of it in hospital. The doctor always had a pleasant, cheery word just him; the nurses, if rough, were kindly, and treated him just the same as the others; his master went across to see him very morning, and lent him more books and papers than his poor dazed eyes could bear to read, and, greatest of all the little pleasures which fell to his lot, Mrs. Cotherstone herself sent him a basket of grapes and oranges on Christmas morning which threw the poor fellow into a perfect fever of anxiety until he had despatched a note of grateful thanks, which, if he had but known it, brought the scalding tears into the gentle little woman's soft eyes. Oh, those grapes and oranges! it seemed like desecration to eat them. Will-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301125" n="110     CAVALRY LIFE"/>ingly would Calcraft have kept them, like the sovereign on his watch-chain, as precious relics.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301127">But at last this pleasant time came to an end, and he was pronounced well enough to resume his duties. So he had to turn his back upon his pleasures, and go back to the old routine. He found, to his utter dismay and horror, that Captain Dickson was going on leave for two months, and could not take a servant with him. Oh, the agony the news caused to Calcraft's heart! Oh, the bitter, bitter disappointment and dread!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301128">He took the news quietly enough, for his master was rather late and in a hurry to be dressed; but when the long process was finished, and he had gone clanking along the echoing corridor and clown the stone steps, Calcraft flung himself down upon the bed, and, burying his face among the pillows, broke into such a passionate torrent of tears that the private's wife who kept the room tidy, happening to come in at that moment, stood stock-still in the doorway, absolutely aghast. Her womanly instinct, however, impelled her to make some effort to comfort him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301129">'What's up, Calcraft?' she asked, advancing to the bed, and laying a hand—which, if coarse and work-worn, was kindly—upon his head; ' is there something else gone wrong? I wouldn't take on so about it if I was you—though, I'm sure, poor chap! it do seem never-ending.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301130">She was a good-hearted woman, and she meant to do kindly; yet, if she had quietly gone away and left him to sob the cobwebs out of his brain, his agony might have passed; as it; was, he jumped up and rushed out of the room, stung afresh by the shame of having been discovered in tears by woman.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301132">He never stopped to think; he tore across the barrack-square and out of the gates, though the sentry asked if anything was amiss as he passed. Calcraft never heard him. On he sped, seeing nothing for the blinding tears which filled his eyes, hearing nothing for the agony throbbing in his brain. On he went; along the path leading through the drill-field, unaware that Captain Dickson had flung himself off his horse, and, followed by half a dozen dragoons, had started in pursuit with a cry of 'Great God! the river!' Calcraft never heard or saw anything save that broad stream shining through the trees at the other end of the drill-field—the river, where he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301131" n="111     CALCRAFT--A TROOPER"/>might find what he had been seeking so long, a haven of forgetfulness and peace.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301133">Ah, the yell which rose up from the onlookers as the tall figure sprang headlong into the water, followed, an instant later, by the officer and a young private, who had been Cal-craft's friend. There was just one moment of suspense before the Captain's dark, close-cropped head appeared above the bank, and then that of the private, as they dragged the poor fellow on to the walk.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301134">Colonel Cotherstone just reached the walk as Captain Dickson gave Calcraft's arm an angry shake.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301135">'What are you thinking of, you d——d idiot?' he asked indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301136">Calcraft looked at his preserver in a blank, dazed kind of
way. 'You'd best have let me finish it, sir,' he answered
indistinctly, and then fainted away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301137">'Dash me!' said the young private, wiping the water from his face—there might have been a few tears there, too— 'dash me, if I ever saw anything like that!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301138">'Here, some of you, get him up to the hospital at once,' ordered the Colonel; 'and you, Captain Dickson, the sooner you get those wet clothes off, the better; you, too, Johnson; you have acted with great bravery, but there is no need to have rheumatic fever as a consequence.'</p><milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301139">'I'll tell you what you shall do,' said little Mrs. Cotherstone, when she heard the story a few hours later: ' you shall buy his discharge—don't you call it so?—and give him to me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301140">'But what will you do with him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301141">'Make a butler of him,' was the prompt reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301142">For many weeks, though, it seemed as if Calcraft would have no need of interest or of anything else in this world. He lay on his bed in the hospital, raving in brain-fever, and, when at last that left him, the doctors found the prostration and weakness almost worse to deal with than the fever had been.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301143">But they brought him round, after all; or perhaps, as Dr. Markham declared, the medicine which did him most good was when Mrs. Cotherstone went to see him, and asked if he would like to leave the army and enter their service as a butler.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301145">'But I don't know anything of the work, ma'am,' he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301144" n="112     CAVALRY LIFE"/>stammered, though the pleased flush on his poor worn face showed how intense was his delight at her proposal.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301146">'But you can learn,' she answered decidedly; and so poor Calcraft's future was settled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301147">He progressed with amazing rapidity after that, and, in order to complete the cure, Mrs. Cotherstone sent him to her Scotch place for a month, where, as he himself said, he was almost too happy to live.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301148">Not very long after this Mrs. Cotherstone presented her lord with a son and heir. Oh that child! How in the years which followed Calcraft worshipped him! No service which the youngster exacted was too difficult for Calcraft to perform; to him the boy's wishes and commands were law, absolute as 'the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth not.' All the passionate gratitude which the mother had raised in him he lavished upon the boy, and the sweetest music that ever rang in his ears was when the tender, imperative child's voice sounded through the house with the word which was oftenest upon his lips—that word was 'Cal—cwaft!'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_060" n="8" type="story"><head>THE VICTORIA CROSS: WHY MAJOR CREYKE DID NOT WIN IT.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301149">IT was midwinter. The afternoon of a dull December day was drawing to a close, and as yet the lamps were not lighted in the drawing-room of the house which the Cotherstones called home. A blazing fire, however, lighted up the room sufficiently for little Mrs. Cotherstone to study the pages of a book which she held in her hand. The Colonel sat opposite, tired out by a hard day's work, and more than half asleep. The boy, now nearly a year old, was on the rug between them, holding a court-martial on his father's boots, occasionally pricking himself with the spurs, and making his tiny hands excessively dirty— his hands and his little embroidered frock.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301150">'Ned,' remarked the Colonel's wife, <hi rend="italic">à propos</hi> of nothing, 'I've been looking in the Army List.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301151">'Eh, what, my darling?' suddenly rousing himself into an upright position.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301152">'I've been looking in the Army List,' she repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301153">'Oh, is that all? I thought something had happened to the boy,' sinking back in his chair again.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301154" n="113     THE VICTORIA CROSS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301155">Reminded of the boy, Mrs. Cotherstone looked down, and, seeing his occupation, uttered a scream of disgust, which the child quickly echoed by a loud crow of delight.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301156">'Dir—ty boy!' cried Mrs. Cotherstone, in energetic staccato tones; ' such a mess he's in. Ring the bell, Ned dear, please.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301157">The Colonel did as he was told, and a moment later our old friend Calcraft appeared, looking quite irreproachable in his faultless evening attire.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301158">'Take him away, Calcraft,' cried the little lady; 'he has made himself so dirty with Colonel Cotherstone's boots.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301159">As Calcraft advanced, the child put out two dimpled arms to him, and expressed his satisfaction in a series of ' Boo-o-o-o's.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301160">'How fond he is of the child!,' said the Colonel's wife, as the door closed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301161">'Yes,' answered the Colonel; he was rather sleepy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301162">'I've been looking in the Army List,' Mrs. Cotherstone announced for the third time, 'and I cannot find anywhere that Major Creyke has the Victoria Cross.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301163">'Of course not,' returned the Colonel with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301164">'But he has it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301165">'Certainly not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301166">'But they always call him " V.C.

Oh, I am so disappointed, Ned! I have been fancying all sorts of bravery; and now it has gone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301169">'Oh, he has bravery and pluck enough; you need not be disappointed,' he answered. ' He gained the name out in the Mutiny, though he did not win the Cross itself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301170">'And how was it?' she asked with deep interest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301172">'Well, I can only give you the merest outlines of the story,' he said, 'for it's a good while ago, and my head was in a state of confusion for a long time after that awful business had been cleared up. Creyke's father and mine were, from their earliest boyhood, upon terms of the closest friendship; their fathers had been the same before them. My father owned the Hall; Creyke's father was Rector of the parish. Well, Creyke was only a year younger than I was, and somehow we fell into the same line as our fathers and grandfathers had done before 
us, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301171" n="114     CAVALRY LIFE"/>and our friendship was, I really believe, more passionate and tragically inclined than even theirs. We were lucky enough to get into the same regiment, and we were so silly as to get sent to India, soon after which the Mutiny broke out; it was <hi rend="italic">just</hi> after you were married, Mary.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301173">'Yes,' she replied, 'but the regiment did not go.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301174">'No. The 7th Lancers were short of subalterns, having lost several by cholera or misadventure, and I volunteered to go; they wanted two. Of course Creyke insisted upon going, too, though his father and mine came down to us, and did their best to persuade us not to go. It was no good. I had made up my mind, and Creyke's mind was mine; so we went. It was all very jolly at first: we liked India, and there was any amount of splendid sport. We liked the regiment, and Colonel Cornwallis was a downright good sort, with the sweetest, prettiest little wife you ever saw. The fellows used to fight almost as to whether Mrs. Cornwallis or her sister, Miss Bannister, was the lovelier. For my part, I admired the Colonel's wife the more of the two—I always did like fair women best: Miss Bannister was very dark. It was no good any of the subalterns looking at her, for the Major went out in the same ship with her, and made matters safe; though I don't think they were engaged. Well, the Mutiny broke out, and then we found what splendid women they were! They had always been admired, but after the siege began they were simply idolized. How they worked! Nothing seemed too hard for them: they cooked, and washed, and nursed, until they were fairly worn out, always cheering us on, always ready in any emergency; they seemed to shrink from nothing. Mrs. Cornwallis made no distinction; it might be the sick baby of an officer's wife, or a private soldier, it was all the same to her; and as for Floss Bannister, I believe any man in the garrison would have walked straight into the enemy's lines at a word from her. Well, towards the end, Major Gurney was killed, and we thought the shock had killed her, too; but an hour after we had buried him she went her rounds as usual. I never shall forget that night! Creyke and I were on duty together at one of the outposts, with one gun and perhaps a dozen men. We could see the black brutes moving about, but we couldn't hit them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301175">'"I've had two shots at one of those black fiends," I heard one fellow growl to another, "and I've missed him both times."</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301176" n="115     THE VICTORIA CROSS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301177">'"I don't expect we'll have no luck, since Miss Floss has given up comin'—not that we can expect it of her, the darlin'!" for I must tell you she had been accustomed, in spite of her pressure of work inside the garrison, to visit the outposts every hour or so, ever since the chaplain died. At his death she took up his work where he left it, poor chap! and she stuck to it bravely right up to the time of the Major's death. Every hour or so she used to come. Sometimes she sang a hymn, or read a few words, or just said the Lord's Prayer; if a soldier's wife was ill, and he couldn't get off duty to see her, he might trust Miss Floss to bring him news half a dozen times a day. Well, after the Major was killed, we never expected to see her again; for it had been a terrible blow for her, and they carried her away from his poor body in a dead faint. We hadn't been back long from the funeral, and just as the trooper ended, "We can't expect it of her, the darlin'!" she appeared.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301178">'"You ought not to have come," Creyke said to her reproachfully; 'no one expected it of you, after such a shock as you have just had."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301179">'"My duty is to the living," she said in a perfectly calm voice. "I have done my duty to the dead, and I thank God for it. Major Gurney has shown us all how gloriously we may do our duty, and I will not be the first to sit down and say, 'I can struggle no longer.'"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301180">'If her tears were dried up, Creyke's were not, and he turned away his head that she might not see them; he had loved her for months, poor chap! and I believe he would have given his life for Gurney's, if he could have taken that dreadful look of suffering out of her eyes. She turned away from him then.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301181">'"Is Robert Moss here?" she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301182">'"Here, miss," he answered, stepping out from behind another man, with suspiciously wet eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301183">'"Your wife seems a good deal better," she said. "I have just seen her, and she sent her love to you."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301184">'"Thank you, miss," he answered, turning away with eyes overflowing again; then in a choked voice, "Maybe you'll give my love to Mary, and say I'll come in as soon as I can get off."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301185">'She only stayed a few minutes, and just as she was moving away, a great hulking Irishman ran after her and caught her gown—a great brute that had been one of the worst scamps in the regiment.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301186" n="116     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301187">'"Shure, miss, darlin'," he blurted out, "ye won't try to stop the blissid tears from comin'? They'll do ye a power o' good, Miss Floss, an' we can't bear to see ye look like that."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301188">'She lifted her soft dark eyes to his for a moment, and then she laid her little work-worn hand in his great fist.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301189">'"My tears are all burnt up, Michael," she said gratefully; "but I shall not forget what you have said to me."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301190">'And then she went away, and our watch dragged on. Each day, for the past fortnight, we had been sure matters could not get any worse, but somehow they did.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301191">'It was not many days after this that they drove us back from that very outpost, and we were obliged to leave one of our few guns. The command had by that time fallen upon a man named Hood, a first-rate officer, though still rather young.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301192">'"It's a pity to let them have that gun," he exclaimed vexedly. "Their fire's bad enough, but to have our own guns turned against us will be too bad."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301193">'"Couldn't it be spiked, sir?" Creyke asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301194">'"Yes, of course; only the chances are ten to one against it's being done: the fire is so heavy there," he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301195">'Of course a dozen volunteers stood out immediately, Creyke and I amongst the rest. I was chosen at once, and Creyke insisted upon going too. We were determined that the brutes should not have the gun; but, upon my word, it was anything but pleasant, running right in the face of the enemy's fire, with only a half-ruined wall for shelter. I can tell you we accomplished our task expeditiously—I know my only idea was how soon I could get out of danger; for we were in almost as much peril from our fellows' bullets as from the enemy's, as a continual cross-fire was kept up the whole time. Just as we turned for a rush from the shelter of the half-ruined wall, I heard a yell from the black fiends behind us; and before I had gone three yards I came down to the ground with a crash, with what I knew must be a bullet in my shoulder and a second in my hip. Creyke heard only the yell and ran on. I tried to get up and follow him; but I fell back, half fainting with the pain, and shut my eyes, with a feeling that it was all up with me. I don't remember much more, until I found Creyke bending over me with more resolution in his face than I had ever seen in it before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301196">'"It's all right, old chap," he said coolly. "The brutes have winged you, but I'll have you inside in five minutes."</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301197" n="117     THE VICTORIA CROSS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301198">'"Go back; you'll only get hit yourself," I answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301199">'" Can you use your legs?" he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301200">'" Got a ball in my right hip."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301201">'I saw him take out his penknife and begin ripping up a scarf which happened to be lying near, and then I fancy I must have gone off again; for, the next time I opened my eyes, Floss Bannister was bathing my forehead, and the doctor was bending over me.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301202">'"You're a noble fellow, Creyke," I heard Hood say. "If we are spared to get out of this, I shall recommend you for the Cross."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301203">'"I didn't do it for the Cross," I heard him answer coolly. "I'm glad we prevented those beasts getting the gun, and I couldn't leave Cotherstone to die out there. I should never have faced his father again, as long as I lived."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301204">'"Never mind your reasons," Hood said warmly; "they don't lessen your heroism, whatever they were."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301205">'Creyke came round to us then, and asked if he could help in any way.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301206">'"Lend me a penknife," answered the doctor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301207">'"Oh, by Jove! I've left it behind me," he said, in a disgusted tone. "I'll run and fetch it."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301208">'"You will do nothing of the kind," put in Hood imperatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301209">'"But it's the only one I have, sir," returned Creyke mildly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301210">'"I forbid you to go; I distinctly forbid it."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301211">'"Oh, I must go, sir," he said quietly; "I shan't be a minute." And he did so, returning in a few minutes, breathless, but unscathed. "Here's your knife, doctor," he said, as coolly as if he had fetched it out of the hospital.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301212">'"Now, sir," I heard Hood say sternly—I could only just hear him, for they were trying to move me, and I was turning very sick and faint again—"you have chosen to disobey my orders, therefore I shall not recommend you for the Cross. It is given for valour, not for foolhardiness."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301213">'And that was how Creyke missed the V.C.,' he ended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301214">'And what became of her?' Mrs. Cotherstone asked, wiping away her tears, which had been falling plentifully during the recital.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301216">'The last time I heard of her, she was still living with the Cornwallises; and I fancy she would have yielded to Creyke's <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301215" n="118     CAVALRY LIFE"/>prayers, only she promised Gurney just at the last that she would meet him in heaven—Floss Bannister still. Of course, you know, Mary, I don't mean that she has forgotten him; but perhaps she might have been induced to let Creyke care for her, but for the promise.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301217">'And Major Creyke?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301218">'Creyke! Oh, there will never be anyone like her for him. He will love her all his life, as he will never love any other human being. I wonder I never told you all this before, darling. I am afraid I've been so happy myself that I have never thought of other people's troubles; and, somehow, I don't care to look back to the time when I had not found you again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301219">Mrs. Cotherstone put her soft hands into her husband's with a most tender smile upon her fair face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301220">'I hope I may meet her some day, Ned,' she said earnestly. 'I should like to see the woman who saved your life for me; and as for Major Creyke—ah! now I think I shall never be able to make enough of him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301221">'Only don't make me jealous,' he interposed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301222">'And how was it,' she asked presently, 'that you came back to the Cuirassiers?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301223">'My darling, at heart we were only volunteers—at least, that is to say, our interests and pride were all centred in the old regiment. We always looked upon ourselves as Cuirassiers; and as soon as I had a chance of a troop in the old regiment I took it. The Cornwallises had left then, for the Colonel was too badly wounded to be fit for service again; and, as Floss Bannister was gone, Creyke exchanged at once, though he lost ever so much seniority by doing so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301224">'Will he ever marry, do you think?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301225">'Floss would not have him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301226">'Ah, but I meant anyone else. Men do such things, you know, Ned.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301227">'Do you think I could ever have married anyone but yourself?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301228">'Of course not,' she replied indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301229">'Well, then, I don't think Creyke will, either.'</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301230" n="119     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_062" n="9" type="story"><head>THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301231">'NOT exactly handsome,' said Captain Dickson, in reply to a question put to him by a brother officer, 'but the sort of girl that every second man would turn round to look after.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301232">'Ah!' returned the other—by name Gough—comprehensively, and as if he perfectly understood the description, 'and what class?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301233">'Oh, a lady, decidedly,' said Dickson hastily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301234">'What a queer thing we've never met her,' remarked the other. 'Perhaps she's some parson's or lawyer fellow's daughter.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301235">'Very likely,' said Dickson indifferently. 'She's a splendid woman, whoever she is. She did fetch me, no mistake about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301236">'Where did you see her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301237">'At the minster; followed her down Coney Street, and then she went up Micklegate way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301238">'Lives that way, probably,' suggested Gough.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301239">'Probably,' returned Dickson; and then they fell to talking of other things.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301240">But the remembrance of the lady did not fade from the memory of the man whom she had so favourably impressed. Try as he would, he could not get her out of his head. Whilst he was dressing for mess that evening, her face and attitude kept rising before his eyes, until he was vexed with himself for being such a fool. Still, she was grand; there was no doubt about it. He had gone to afternoon prayers at the minster partly because he had nowhere else to go, and partly because the anthem announced to be sung was of unusual beauty, and immediately upon entering his attention had been attracted by a lady in the stalls opposite—a young lady, apparently about twenty, with dead-gold hair and a perfectly colourless face. Captain Dickson had eyes keen as any hawk's, and he 'spotted' the dead-gold hair and the colourless face instantly; also that she had large dark eyes—to be sure, they might be gray, or even deep blue, but at that distance they had the appearance of dark eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301242">When the service began, and she rose to her feet, his admiration still further increased, for he perceived that she was of magnificent build and proportions. She was clad in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301241" n="120     CAVALRY LIFE"/>some tightly-fitting soft material, of a dark blue shade, and round her throat, below her plain linen collar, she wore a broad band of gold. Captain Dickson immediately decided in his own mind that dark blue and gold are the most becoming colours a woman can wear, especially if she chance to have dead-gold hair and a perfectly colourless complexion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301243">I am afraid he did not attend very much to the service, nor to the anthem which he had gone to hear; his eyes scarcely ever strayed from the grand figure opposite in the blue dress with the collar of gold. And yet, when the object of his admiration had disappeared over Ouse Bridge, and he had be-taken himself back to barracks, snatches of the lovely music kept rising to his lips:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301244">'These are they which came out of great tribulation, and I have washed their robes, find made them white in the blood of the Lamb.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301245">Ah, what haunting music it was! Why—he wondered—why, as the emblem of great tribulation, should there rise before him a colourless face framed in dead-gold hair? Surely she could not have come out of great tribulation! It was only a proof of the strange fancies which at times creep into a man's mind. And yet he remembered most vividly how, during the anthem, she had seated herself with what he would swear was a sigh, and, closing her eyes, leant her head back against the carved oak, and remained so until the anthem was ended. It was not a happy gesture—it was the gesture of a woman who, as yet, had not realized the truth of the words they were singing:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301246">'They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301247">They shall hunger—no more! Just then, as she sat down, he caught—or he fancied so, which was almost the same—a wistful glance from those dark eyes which told him very plainly that it had not come to her to hunger no more. He was quite right; there are many kinds of hunger.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301249">Three days later he met her in the town, and her face haunted him more than ever, for it had the rare characteristic of being nicer as you approached nearer to it. Captain Dick-son had a good look at her, for she never even glanced towards him. He saw that she wore the same dress as he had seen her in before, and that there was a younger girl with her, evidently her sister, from the similarity of costume and also from the striking resemblance of person. True, she was of a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301248" n="121     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/>brighter, rosier, more lively type, and looked at the tall, dark-haired soldier with interest enough; but, to his mind, she was not half so charming as her sister, who took no more notice of him than if he had been some country clodhopper on a market-day, and who seemed to him to be the living personification of that ideal woman of that ideal woman whom the poet sings:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301250">'Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null, dead perfection, no more.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301251">And yet, when he came to think of it, it was hardly an apt description. Each feature was good, and yet the whole was not handsome—faultily faultless, so far good—the face was cold, it was also regular in outline. Good thus far, but for the next clause he had a different opinion—he could not agree with that: a vision of wistful dark eyes came before his mental vision, and a pale face, against a background of dark oak; the face was not null, though the perfection of it might have been described by some people as dead. A great man has said that every face should be a history or a prophecy: hers contained the history of cruel suffering.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301252">He tried several times to find out who she was, but without success. Then he met her in a shop; on that occasion her umbrella, which had been set against a chair, was thrown to the ground, and he had the pleasure of picking it up and restoring it to her. She thanked him with a bow and a grave smile, but without speaking. Captain Dickson wished she had spoken; she had, he felt convinced, a sweet voice, as tender as her face, and he would have liked to hear it. Presently her sister asked her a question about something she was buying, but still she did not speak, only bent her head. Captain Dickson wondered impatiently if she had guessed how much he wished to hear her voice, and was trying to tantalize him. But no; the utter unconsciousness of the girl's face was a sufficient answer to his question. Had he been a wooden dummy standing there, she could not have taken less notice of him; nay, had he been a dummy, she might have looked at it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301253">She moved towards a stand of photographs at the side of the shop, and presently her sister addressed her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301254">'Nell, do you want any of these?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301256">Now surely she must answer, thought Dickson; but she did not, only shook her head and turned again to her study of the photographs. How aggravating! Well, he had learnt some-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301255" n="122     CAVALRY LIFE"/>thing—her name was Nell. Nell!—what a lovely name! And then the sisters turned to leave the shop, seeing which Captain Dickson made a rush for the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301257">'Permit me,' he said politely, holding it wide open.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301258">'Thank you,' said the younger sister; but the elder merely bowed again, with another grave smile, the counterpart of that which she had given him before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301259">'Who are those ladies?' he asked, when they had gone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301260">'Their name is Vansittart, sir,' the man replied; 'they live somewhere on the Mount. Mrs. Vansittart is a widow.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301261">'Ah, really!' Captain Dickson's tone implied that he was not much interested in the Vansittart family, yet, for all that, he repeated her name a hundred times to himself, just for the pleasure of hearing it—'Nell Vansittart.' He didn't know when a name had taken him so. He wondered impatiently why she couldn't have spoken—just 'Thank you,' as her sister had said. Surely two words couldn't have been much trouble! And then an idea occurred to him which made him hold his breath with the very horror of it. Could it be that she was dumb, and had not power to speak? Dumb! could that glorious creature be dumb—dumb as the beasts which perish? Was it that which gave those soft eyes such a speaking language of their own? Could it be that which gave that gravely sweet smile such pathetic eloquence? Oh, heavens! surely not! Dumb!—why, she could not be dumb, for she was not deaf. No, no! what an idiot he was ever to fancy anything so repulsive, so horrible! He would hasten to dress for mess, that he might go down and forget that so hideous a conception had ever found a place—even for a moment—in his mind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301262">But, still, he could not shake off the painful impression which his conjecture had produced, and his brother officers were not slow in discovering that something unusual was amiss with him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301263">'What's the matter with Dickson?' one asked of another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301264">'Don't know; fallen in love, perhaps,' was the reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301265">'Oh, he'll get over it,' laughed the one who had spoken first.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301266">'What does Dickson look so blue about to-night?' was asked at another part of the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301267">'Can't say. His young woman's given him the slip, perhaps.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301268">'Very likely. I say, Dickson, what's up?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301269">'Up?' said Dickson stupidly.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301270" n="123     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301271">'Yes, up—wrong—amiss—anything you like.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301272">'Oh, nothing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301273">'Has she turned out a failure?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301274">'She?' repeated Dickson, who, having his head full of Nell Vansittart, wondered how Gore could know anything about it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301275">'Why, bless my soul, man!' cried the other, 'you might as well be deaf and dumb for all the information one can get out of you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301276">Deaf and dumb! Captain Dickson started so violently at the words that a general laugh went round the table. He did not laugh, only went on quietly eating his dinner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301277">'Must be in love,' remarked a young 'sub' to his neighbour in tones just loud enough for Dickson to catch. 'And, oh, by Jove! what beastly bad rissoles these are! 'Pon my soul, one might get as good in any cook-shop.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301278">Captain Dickson looked up, and fixed his cool blue eyes upon the speaker.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301279">' I'll tell you what it is, young man,' he said in a quiet, distinct voice, which could be well heard all over the room, 'if we have any more of your nonsense about the mess-cookery, <hi rend="italic">we'll send you home to rough it for six weeks</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301280">'Dickson <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have fallen in love,' said one man <hi rend="italic">sollo voce</hi> to another. ' but his tongue's as caustic and his wit as keen as ever it was.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301281">N.B.—Before I go on with my story, I may as well remark that the dissatisfied 'sub' did not venture to open his mouth during the rest of the evening.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301282">Well, not many days after this, the yeomanry ball came off. Captain Dickson went in good time, just on the chance of the Vansittarts being there. As a reward, he had not been in the room five minutes before he perceived the younger of the sisters standing near one of the pillars, in animated conversation with a yeomanry officer. He went straight across the room and asked for an introduction, and, having obtained her card, put his name down for the next dance. It was a waltz, and he enjoyed it. The girl was pretty, well dressed, and a good waltzer; moreover, he was looking forward to being introduced to her sister.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301283">'Perhaps you will introduce me to your sister,' he said, when she suggested returning to her mother.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301284">'My sister is not here,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301285">'Indeed! How is that? I hope she is not ill?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301286" n="124     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301287">'Oh no; but—she does not visit;' and then, having secured another dance, he was obliged to leave her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301288">'She does not visit.' Yes, that was what she said. There was not the slightest doubt about her words or her meaning—'She does not visit.' What could there be to prevent her from visiting? There must be some cause, he argued; young women of twenty, or thereabouts, don't shun the world's pleasures without some very good cause. Then, what could that cause be? He danced once or twice with her sister, and discovered that her name was Constance; that since their father's death they had lived in Edinburgh, and that they had only been in York a few months. Miss Constance could not say whether they were likely to remain long or not—she thought not; but it would depend chiefly upon her sister.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301289">'I wonder,' said Captain Dickson, in his most deferential tone—'I wonder if you would be offended if I asked you a very impertinent question?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301290">'You had better ask it and see,' she returned, with a laugh. 'What is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301291">'I have seen you and your sister in the town once or twice,' he answered, 'and I should like to know why she does not visit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301292">Miss Constance looked down at her gloves, tore a flower from her bouquet, destroyed it, looked up hesitatingly, as if his question was an unwelcome one, and then looked down again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301293">'If you would rather not answer it, pray say so,' he answered gently. 'It was really a most impertinent thing to ask.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301294">'No, no; not at all,' she said hastily. 'The fact is, Captain Dickson, my sister had a misfortune a few months ago, and we have never been able to persuade her to go into society since.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301295">'Oh yes; I understand,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301296">But understand he decidedly did not. A misfortune? It had an ominous sound about it which he did not like at all. A misfortune? 'Why, bless me!' he thought, 'there can't be anything wrong with her morals; and what could it be else to make her withdraw entirely from the world?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301297">She was right in her head, that was very certain; then, what could it be?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301299">The following day he walked up towards the Mount, hoping to meet them—meaning the Vansittarts. Just outside <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301298" n="125     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/>Micklegate Bar he saw them in the distance, coming towards him. He stopped and held out his hand to Constance; Miss Vansittart walked composedly on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301300">And thus during several weeks were his efforts baffled. At length she gave up going into the town with her sister in the afternoon, and once or twice, when he had contrived to get himself asked in to have a cup of tea, she never went into the room. Once he just caught sight of the tail of her gown, and a glimpse of her dead-gold hair, but to him she was a very will-o'-the-wisp; it seemed absolutely impossible to reach her presence. But still he did not give up his object; he was determined to know her, and at last he succeeded, for one day he went in with Constance, and entered the room too suddenly for her to escape.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301301">'Let me introduce Captain Dickson, Nell,' said Constance. 'My sister, Captain Dickson.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301302">Being in her own house, Miss Vansittart could not well avoid laying her hand in Captain Dickson's outstretched palm, and, having done that, she could not immediately leave the room, as she would have liked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301303">'How very cold it is to-day,' he said, addressing himself pointedly to her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301304">Again that little grave bow. He was nonplussed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301305">'I'll ask her a question,' he thought; then said aloud: 'Do you skate at all?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301306">'I do not,' she answered, flushing vividly as she spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301307">He understood it all in a moment. Those three words had told him what it was that Constance had called a 'misfortune'. Miss Vansittart had, through some accident, lost her voice, and could not speak above a whisper. All his soldierly tact and polish came to his aid now. He would not let her feel ill at ease with him. He took a seat beside her, and talked away as fluently and pleasantly as if young ladies who could not speak above a whisper very often came in his way; and presently, when Constance went to take her hat off, and Mrs. Vansittart left the room for a moment, he remarked coolly:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301308">'Do you know, Miss Vansittart, I have been trying to make your acquaintance for ever so long?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301309">'Yes; I know'—in that strange whispering voice, which thrilled his very soul's inmost recesses—'but—I—never see people.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301311">'Yes; I understand exactly. Of course, I didn't know <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301310" n="126     CAVALRY LIFE"/>until this evening, but I understand now. You won't keep out of my way again, will you?' he asked persuasively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301312">'But,' she began hesitatingly, 'is not my voice very disagreeable to you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301313">'Disagreeable?' he echoed; 'no, indeed. I don't admire your screaming women, whose tongues go five-and-twenty to the dozen, until you are deafened.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301314">'I always feel so reluctant to speak,' she continued, 'for some people look astonished and others smile, as if there could be anything amusing in having lost one's voice—in such a deprivation.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301315">'When people display a visible lack of brains, you should be lenient, Miss Vansittart,' he said gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301316">'Yes, perhaps; only one is apt to think only of one's self,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301317">Then the others returned. Poor Mrs. Vansittart was so charmed to see Nell interested and pleased once more that she could not make enough of the man who had wrought the change. He lingered until the irate cook was only forcibly restrained from rushing upstairs to give him a piece of her mind—not a small piece, by any means; but at last he did take his leave.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301318">Mrs. Vansittart followed him out into the hall.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301319">'I don't know how to express my gratitude to you,' she said. 'I have not seen Nell so bright and like herself since she met with the accident which deprived her of her voice, and you know'—with a sound of tears in her tones—'you know what that must be to her mother.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301320">'Mrs. Vansittart,' he said quietly, 'I wish you would give me a general invitation to come here.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301321">'With all my heart.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301322">'Thank you much,' he answered heartily, and, pressing her hand, departed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301323">He was too late for mess, but he had some dinner in his room, and went into the anteroom afterwards. He found there one or two strangers who had been dining at mess—strangers to him, that is to say. One of them was speaking as he entered the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301324">'Have any of you met some people called Vansittart—a mother and two daughters? I heard they had come to York.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301325">'What makes her keep out of sight now?' someone asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301327">'Oh, poor girl! She was engaged to Towers-Brooke, of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301326" n="127     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/>the Drab Horse, and just about a year ago we were all staying at Bullidean—Gylglen's place. Well, Miss Vansittart—Nell, everyone called her—slipped into a deep brook one afternoon, and got soaked to the skin. We tried to persuade her to go into a cottage and get dried there, but she persisted in driving home—some six miles. Towers-Brooke was always a queer-tempered fellow, and of course he was anxious about her; but he told her—roughly enough, and before all of us—that if she didn't do as she was told he would never speak to her again. She didn't hesitate a minute; a dogcart was standing by, so she jumped in and drove off by herself. Towers-Brooke never said a word; he drove the drag back to Bullidean, with a regular pack inside—for four had gone in the dogcart—and he never once opened his mouth the whole way. I happen to know that, because I sat next to him. We reached the house about six o'clock, and he was off to London at seven, without his dinner even. Mrs. Gylglen was rather vexed about it, but Nell Vansittart was taken so ill with some lung complaint that no one had time to talk or think of anything else, and the end of it was that she lost her lover and her voice—hard upon her, poor girl!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301328">'He wouldn't be much loss,' remarked one of the audience.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301329">'I think she was fond of him,' returned the guest, in a musing tone; 'and there was no doubt whatever about Towers-Brooke's feelings, only he was one of those determined chaps that would keep his word if it spoilt his whole life, and killed him in the end.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301330">'Oh, one of your pig-headed brutes!' drawled a Cuirassier, who had not been particularly charmed by the description of Mr. Towers-Brooke—'or what some people call "firm."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301331">'Yes, exactly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301332">'Ah, well, I think Miss Vansittart has done well to get out of it. Men of that calibre are all very well in story-books, but they are the very devil to live with. I happen to know, because my old governor's one of the sort. If I were a woman, I'd rather marry ever such a fool.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301333">'A clever sort of chap,' put in another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301335">'Clever as daylight,' responded the guest—'as clever as daylight I dined with the Drab Horse on the day of their last steeplechases, when Brooke had ridden a horse of Jefferson's and won the cup, which was open to the army. Of course they made a great fuss about it, and toasted the horse; <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301334" n="128     CAVALRY LIFE"/>then they called for the owner, and Jefferson got up in the most approved style, laid his hand on his heart, and bowed on all sides. They thought they were going to get a speech out of him, but they couldn't, so they called for the jockey. Towers-Brooke got up and made his bow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301336">'"I think my master has said enough for both of us," said he, and sat down again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301337">'Very good,' laughed the Cuirassiers <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301338">'And that same night,' he continued, 'old Fitz-Hugh, who was Colonel at that time, by way of mixing the company, had asked the R.C. priest to meet the chaplain and another parson. The introduction opened the proceedings; the chaplain, an enormously fat man, very bald and urbane, was walked up to the priest as soon as he entered the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301339">'"Oo-o," said the Colonel—you know his extraordinary way of speaking—"Oo-o; let me introduce you to my very good friend, Father O'Reilly."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301340">'I never saw a man's face fall as his did in my life; if old Fitz-Hugh had presented him to the devil himself—horns and hoof and all—his bow couldn't have been more solemn or his face have expressed greater disgust. The priest, who was a jolly sort of chap, saw the joke in a minute. Well, the other parson had just arrived in time to see the meeting between the two, so old Fitz-Hugh took the priest's arm, and led him across the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301341">'"Oh, Lloyd—oo-o—let me introduce you to my very good friend, Father O'Reilly."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301342">'He looked back at us as he spoke, to see if we all fully appreciated the crowning point of his little jest; but, to the general disgust, the new-comer held out a hand, with a hearty "How are you, O'Reilly?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301343">'"How are ye, me dear fellow?" returned the priest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301344">'"Oo-o!" gasped Fitz-Hugh; "then, you know Father O'Reilly? Oo-o!"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301345">'"Sure, yis. Me good friend Lloyd often comes an' smokes a pipe with me," answered the priest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301346">'I really don't know whether the roar of laughter which followed was at the Colonel's <hi rend="italic">done</hi> look or at the righteous horror on the chaplain's fat face. Perhaps it was at the remark with which the Irishman finished up the Colonel's little plot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301348">'"I'm always deloighted to meet any friend of yours, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301347" n="129     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/>Colonel," he said, taking a glass of sherry and bitters from the tray as he spoke, "but I make a rhule of drawing the line <hi rend="italic">after</hi> the establishment."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301349">'And now we must be going, Russell,' he said, rising, 'or your wife will be locking us out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301350">Captain Dickson, after a while, went up to his room in a strangely meditative mood. There was a roaring fire blazing up the chimney, and a newspaper lying on the table. He sat down in his accustomed chair, for the first time since he had joined the army, thoroughly dissatisfied with his life. All at once it seemed to have grown utterly distasteful to him. He looked round the little room, with eyes no longer blind to the many makeshifts and shabbinesses which it contained. There were the common deal legs of the table protruding from beneath the torn, stained cloth which covered it; there were the usual make-believe dressing-table, with its cretonne hangings, and the petticoated chairs—how his soul loathed them!—and there, in the corner, with which regularly every morning he barked his shins, was the big bath, with huge patches of paint knocked off; and there were the window curtains, which made a point of coming down every time he tried to draw them. Hitherto he had merely suffered all these things because he felt it was not worth while to have anything better, to be at the mercy of soldier servants and railway porters; but, somehow, of late a great craving had taken possession of him—a craving for a home; a home in the country, with decent hunting and shooting, with pleasant society, where there would be no practical jokes nor after-dinner songs, such as he could hear them singing in the anteroom at that moment:</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Oh, my Jem—Jemima!</l><l>She's left her loving Sam,</l><l>And gone to be a Mormonite</l><l>In New Jerusalem.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301352">Ugh! how sick he was of it all! No wonder; he had heard Gore sing that song almost every night for the last five years. He invariably got on a chair, and see-sawed his arms up and down whilst he sang it. He didn't know, or, rather, he never attempted, any other, and he could not be said to <hi rend="italic">know</hi> that. Oh, how weary he was of it all! The stale jokes. He knew everyone's story, and just at what part of the evening it would be brought in. A new story or joke was a perfect godsend to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301351" n="130     CAVALRY LIFE"/>them. Would they never grow tired of trying how much mustard and pepper Martin could take without finding out his food had been tampered with? Would they never cease to treat old Barber's bald head as a round of toast, and butter it? Would they never discover that life may be of better worth than turning men out of their beds as soon as they have got comfortably into them, and marching them about draughty corridors in scanty attire, at the risk of rheumatic fever and lung complaints? He wondered, with a long sigh, how he had managed to live to thirty years of age without finding all this out. It was because—and his heart told him the reason quickly enough—he had never taken a fancy for a country house and a wife who should have dead-gold hair and a colourless complexion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301353">He leant back in his chair and gave himself up to the pleasure of contemplating his castle, which, as yet, was <hi rend="italic">in nubibus</hi>. How different it would all be! What long, quiet, cosy evenings they would have together! She must sit always close beside him, else he would not be able to hear what she said—the girl he loved—the girl with the strange whispering voice and the serious eyes, with their wistful, pained expression. Curse the fellow who brought that shadow into them! And yet, if things had been otherwise, Nell Vansittart would be to him as nothing. He must not forget that.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301354">There was one thing, however, that he forgot completely—or no, he could not be said to forget it, for the idea had never presented itself to his mind: that was, that it was possible Miss Vansittart might not find herself able to care for him as he cared for her; nor did he admit, even to his own mind, that it was probable she still cherished some of the old tenderness for the man who had once loved her—Towers-Brooke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301355">George Dickson never thought of these possibilities and probabilities, so they did not trouble him. For the next few weeks he went on his roseate way with a brave, joyous heart, and eyes which saw not the tiniest cloud upon the horizon of his future. Day by day he found his way to Mrs. Vansittart's house, and with each visit Nell was more gracious to him, more at ease, more friendly, until at last he summoned up courage, when one afternoon he found her alone, to unfold to her his glowing visions of the future.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301356">'You care for me?' she repeated incredulously.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301357" n="131     THE CAPTAIN OF F TROOP"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301358">'Yes, dear. Is there anything astonishing in that?' he said, with a tender smile.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301359">'Oh, Captain Dickson!' she gasped, her whispering voice growing louder because of her pain. 'Indeed, I never thought of this—I expected it was Constance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301360">'Oh no; it is yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301361">'But I never thought of it!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301362">'Will you not think of it now?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301363">'Oh—no, no!'—it would be hard to say whether the pain in eyes, or voice, or face, was the keenest—'you do not understand; you do not know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301364">He guessed instantly that she was thinking of Towers-Brooke. 'I know all about the man who treated you like the hound he is,' he said savagely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301365">'Don't say it,' she said, holding out her hands imploringly; 'I cannot, will not, hear a word against him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301366">'You love him still?' he asked incredulously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301367">'Love him!' she repeated, heedless of the pain she was inflicting. 'Oh, how I do love him—still!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301368">'You would take him back—now?' Dickson asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301369">'Take him back!' she echoed; 'oh yes, indeed—if he came to me maimed and tattered, crippled and blind, deaf and dumb, I would still take him back gladly. But,' with a sad smile, 'he will not—he will keep his word.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301370">And then he left her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301371">It was all over. He went back to his barrack-room and hated it worse than ever. He had thought to escape from it all, but he had been mistaken. There it all was: the stained table-cloth, the deal legs of the table, the sentries pacing up and down outside, Gore singing in his room next door:</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Oh, my Jem—Jemima!</l><l>She's left her loving Sam,</l><l>And gone to be a Mormonite</l><l>In New Jerusalem.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301372">There was the quarter-master's baby squalling just across the corridor, and the Adjutant's wife scolding her servant. There was that poor devil Calcraft in the hospital, and the man he had got in his place knew as much about varnishing boots as he did about making mince-pies. He was thumping at the door at that moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301373">'Sergeant-Major Lucas wants to speak to you, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301375">'Very well.' What could that be for? Nothing to do <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301374" n="132 CAVALRY LIFE"/>
with Calcraft, for he was safe in hospital. He had a good mind to cut
it all, but for the present he was obliged to hear what Lucas had to
say; for, however ill the world used him, he was still the Captain of
F Troop.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_321" n="10" type="story"><head>THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SWAN.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301376">HE made a very bad senior sub; there was no doubt about it. In the
first place, he had ten names, a circumstance which told against him;
in the second, he had a great many distinguished relations, and as
these 'salt of the earth' were not permitted to remain quietly at home
with their wives, but were ostentatiously paraded on every occasion
as, 'Getty, my cousin, you know,' or 'Sir Lucian Boodsworth, my old
uncle,' and a dozen such others, they told against him likewise. As
the Cuirassiers--those who were distinguished, and those who were
not--frequently said, it is doubtless a fine thing to be fifth cousin
to an earl--called for shortness, Getty--and to have an uncle in
Parliament, with the additional charms of being a baronet and a
millionaire; still, even of those good things <hi rend="italic">other</hi> people might have too much.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301377">Then, also, he had no money, and he had worst of all, a mother!
Yes, he had a mother, and she called him 'Lucy.' Now, since he
possessed such a superabundance of names, she might as well have
called him by any of the others, but, by one of the absurd freaks of
coddling love which some mothers indulge in, she called him 'Lucy.'
His brother officers called him 'The Alphabet.' His name, however, in
all its glory, shone thus--Lucian Boodsworth John George Lawrence
Gettandine Sholto Montague Casmo Abdy--ten of them--and his mother
called him 'Lucy,' and his brother officers 'The Alphabet.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301378">Mr Abdy was an only child; indeed, at the time at which the little
incident I am going to relate took place, he was the only son of his
mother, and she was a widow, Mr. Abdy <hi rend="italic">père</hi>
having died some fifteen years previously, to the very great
detriment of his son's bringing-up.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301380">He was not ornamental, and he was certainly not useful. In person
he was singularly unprepossessing; his height was considerably over
six feet, and in width he might be, perhaps, about one-sixth of his
height--barely twelve inches; his
<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301379" n="133     THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SWAN"/>shoulders were of the class known as 'champagne'; in truth, they were so very much of the champagne order that he seemed to have no shoulders at all, only an enormously long neck, to which, somehow, his arms were attached; he had also remarkably long legs, slightly inclined to knock about the knees; and, to crown all these charms, he had a foolish round face, with boiled-gooseberry eyes and white eyelashes, a nondescript nose, a huge mouth, bad teeth, and a mop—a perfect mop— of curly flame-coloured hair.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301381">So much for his personal appearance; now for his accomplishments. Well, he had a personal appearance, though, to be sure, it was not much of a one to look at, but accomplishments he had none. Shoot—he couldn't. To many other pursuits the same description accurately applied—to polo, cricket, riding, swimming, and, indeed, to most of the hundred and one amusements to which soldiers devote themselves. He was once known to drive the drag back to the Blankhampton Barracks, the others having stayed in the town, and on reaching his destination was hailed by an impudent young sub, who hadn't quite got licked into shape, with 'Hallo, Abdy! What have you done with the others?—killed 'em all, eh?' To finish the list of Mr. Abdy's charms, I need only add that he wore his hat on one side, and fancied every woman he met was in love with him. Now, there was no doubt whatever about the hat, but as for the other:</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Oh, wad some power the giftie gie us</l><l>To see oursels as ithers see us!</l><l>It wad frae mony a blunder free us,</l><l>And foolish notion.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301382">The Cuirassiers had been quartered in Blankhampton nearly a year, and had naturally made a large circle of friends in the town and neighbourhood. Shortly after Christmas Mrs. Abdy arrived, and took up her abode in private lodgings, announcing her intention of remaining some time—several months at least.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301383">Her first proceeding was to take advantage of her son's absence at a house in the vicinity, where he had gone for a couple of days' hunting, to go up to the barracks with her maid, and—what she called—'put poor dear Lucy's things tidy,' to the intense delight of such of the officers as were in the barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301385">Now, probably the last person a cavalry officer would like to set loose in his rooms would be his mother—excepting, per-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301384" n="134     CAVALRY LIFE"/>haps, his sweetheart—and 'poor dear Lucy,' not dreaming that such an onslaught would be made during his absence, had left everything in the utmost disorder, it having never occurred to him that such an idea would present itself to the old lady's mind. The very first thing, therefore, that she was enabled to do was to read his love-letters, the result of which was that she indignantly declined offers of help in her self-imposed task from any of the officers, and betook herself back to her lodgings, without having put any of 'poor dear Lucy's' things straight at all, having, in truth, left them rather more untidy than she had found them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301386">Having thought the matter over, with the help of her luncheon and a glass or two of sherry, Mrs. Abdy came to the conclusion that the sooner she could get 'Lucy' married the better. That happened to be exactly 'Lucy's' own opinion, and, like his mother, he, too, inserted a clause in the matrimonial scheme—the clause was <hi rend="italic">money</hi>. What he wanted was youth, beauty, birth, amiability, talent, style, and money. Those were what he <hi rend="italic">wanted</hi>. What, however, he had made up his mind to have was money—as many of the others as he could get, but money first and foremost. He had tried a good many young ladies with the requisite amount of gilding, but, unfortunately, he had not been able to induce them to see things in the same light as himself. Young ladies who have twelve or fifteen hundred a year of their own have usually an exalted opinion of themselves, and look for a little, or, if they marry a poor man, they take care he is something to look at, at all events.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301387">Up to the time of the opening of this story Mr. Abdy had been evidently unappreciated, for he was a bachelor still.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301388">The more his old mother turned the matter over in her mind, the more puzzled did she become, and at last she put on her hat—she was sixty-five at least, but she wore a hat— and sallied out for a promenade down the High Street. She had walked the length of the narrow street, and, having crossed over the road, was proceeding leisurely back by the other side, when a voice exclaimed:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301389">'Why, can that be you, Mrs. Abdy? Who would have thought of seeing you in Blankhampton?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301390">'Mrs. Chillingly!' cried Mrs. Abdy in as great astonishment. 'And who would have thought of seeing you, indeed!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301392">'Ah, who indeed! I'll tell you how it is. My daughter <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301391" n="135     THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SWAN"/>is perfectly wild about hunting, and having tried all the other hunting districts in England, I think, made up her mind that she should never be happy until she had had a few weeks with the Blankhampton Hunt. It ended, of course, in our coming, and she has gone out for her first run this morning.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301393">'Then have you taken a house?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301394">'Oh dear no! We are at the Golden Swan—a very comfortable hotel, too. I want to go as far as the post-office; will you walk with me, and then come back and have a cup of tea?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301395">'Thanks, very many,' returned Mrs. Abdy willingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301396">'And what has brought you into this part of the world?' Mrs. Chillingly inquired.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301397">'Oh, Lucy's regiment is here—my son, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301398">'Oh, really! Very nice for you. I suppose you are in lodgings?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301399">'Yes,' she answered; 'my son has gone to stay a couple of days at Sir Hugh Brooke's—the great iron people, you know; but he will be back this afternoon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301400">'I never met him,' remarked Mrs. Chillingly. 'I never was so surprised as when I saw you walking quietly along.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301401">This was just the chance Mrs. Abdy had been looking for. Miss Chillingly was an heiress; her father had been something in the cotton-spinning line, and had left three hundred thousand pounds between his wife and daughter. She was young, very pretty, a splendid horsewoman, and a charming girl. Could anything be devised to suit 'Lucy' better?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301402">For the next few weeks her whole attention was devoted to the task of bringing the two together. 'Lucy' himself was more than willing. Rosey Chillingly seemed very well pleased at his attentions, and Mrs. Chillingly, whose influence went for a good deal in Mrs. Abdy's calculations, having become utterly tired of being dragged about the country at her daughter's sweet will, was charmed at the idea. She didn't in the least care who Rosey married so long as he was a gentleman, and of 'Lucy's' family there could be no question.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301404">Amongst the officers of the Cuirassiers the marriage was spoken of as a settled thing; they were expecting every evening that Abdy would announce the news; but one afternoon an accidental carelessness made just all the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301403" n="136     CAVALRY LIFE"/>difference in the true state of the case—in this wise: Miss Chillingly was not entirely unknown to the regiment; indeed, with one of the officers, Mr. Bernard, there had been some very, very tender love passages, which had been broken off through a misunderstanding—broken off and never quite cleared up. It happened that when she was returning from a long day's hunting, with 'Lucy' in close attendance and her groom behind, Geoffry Bernard had overtaken them, and seeing a certain softness in Rosey's face, and a certain defiant swagger in Abdy's manner, he greeted her and rode on with them. He fancied—could it be all fancy?—that she seemed suddenly relieved, and at parting he was bold enough to ask, in an undertone, if he might call on the following day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301405">'Surely,' said the girl, turning a pair of brilliant blue eyes up wistfully; 'come in and have a cup of tea. My mother will be delighted.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301406">Then he thanked her, and with Abdy, who had not overheard the little arrangement, slowly rode back to barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301407">But although 'Lucy' had not overheard the conversation between Rosey and Bernard, he knew the latter well enough to be aware that he was more than inclined to go in on his own account, and he determined on the morrow to have the whole thing settled and done with one way or another. What was the use, he argued, of shilly-shallying any longer? Faint heart ne'er won fair lady—and a good deal more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301408">'Walk down into town with me, Abdy?' said Bernard suddenly, as they entered the gates.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301409">'All right; come round to my rooms when you are ready,' he replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301410">After all, it would be as well not to lose sight of Bernard during the next few hours.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301411">So presently Bernard went round to Abdy's rooms—he had been lucky enough to secure two.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301412">'Ready, Abdy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301413">'Not quite,' returned a voice from the inner room, and evidently from behind a towel. 'Shan't be a minute.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301414">Now Geoffry Bernard was very much in love, and considered all things fair in love and war; therefore, seeing a letter lying open on the blotting-pad, he made no more of reading it than if it had been his own. Dishonourable, of course it was, but true for all that. It was not long, and the ink was still wet.</p><pb n="137     THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SWAN" pages="137" facs="jwcavalp137"/><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_12019"><body xml:id="jwcaval_12018"><div xml:id="jwcaval_330" type="letter"><opener><salute>'MY DEAR MISS CHILLINGLY,</salute></opener><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301416">'Will you meet me at the Seven Willows to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock?

When, a few minutes later, Abdy entered, Bernard was resting his arms upon the chimney-shelf and his forehead upon his arms, staring into the fire in the brownest of brown studies.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301418">'Asleep, old man?' Abdy asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301419">'Very nearly,' with a start and a laugh. 'What tiring work hunting is!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301420">'Awfully so,' returned Abdy, folding the letter up and directing it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301421">But all the same, Geoffry had not kept very closely to the truth when he said he was very nearly asleep; he never was further off from sleep in the whole of his life. His quick brain was busy, and the result of his cogitations was that when they got down to the club he wrote a note, and the effect of the note startled the whole of Blankhampton the following morning in such a manner as had not happened for years. In this way: The hotel of the Golden Swan was in the centre of the principal street of the town, a narrow thoroughfare, having barely room for two carriages to pass; the business of the hotel having increased, the owner had secured the house opposite to the original one, and thus the hotel was in two parts, one on each side of the street. In order to attract notice, he had over either entrance door a huge gilded swan, and extending across the street from one house to the other a sign about a foot broad, and placed about sixteen feet from the ground, thus:</p><q><l>THE GOLDEN SWAN.</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301422">Well might the respectable inhabitants of Blankhampton be startled the following morning, when in the <hi rend="italic">Blankhampton Daily Herald</hi> they read the following announcement:</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301423" n="138     CAVALRY LIFE"/><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301424">A HIGH JUMP.—We understand that Mr. L. B. J. G. L. G. S. M. C. Abdy, of the Cuirassiers, has undertaken to clear the sign of the Golden Swan without assistance of any kind.—See advt.</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301425">Of course everyone turned eagerly from the local news to the advertisement sheet. Yes, there it was:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301426">THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SWAN.—Lieutenant Abdy, of the Cuirassiers, will jump the above sign, IN FULL UNIFORM, at 3 o'clock this (Wednesday) afternoon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301427">The public are invited to attend!</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301428">Had Colonel Cotherstone been at home, Bernard's ruse would not have succeeded so well. As it was, no notice was taken of it, for the Major was not out of barracks during the morning, and Bernard took good care that the paper containing the announcement should not come within his reach. Mrs. Abdy was away, having gone to visit the Brookes—'the great iron people, you know'—and so at half-past two 'Lucy' went quietly out of barracks to keep his appointment with Miss Chillingly. Just about that time a little regiment of upholsterers were busy laying down straw and mattresses in order to break the fall. The windows of all the houses and the hotel were full of ladies; there was a crowd of gentlemen about the steps of the hotel and at the coffee-room windows, and <hi rend="italic">the public</hi> had gathered in great force in the street itself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301429">'What does it all mean?' exclaimed Rosey, as Geoffry Bernard entered their sitting-room about twenty minutes to three.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301430">'Haven't you seen the papers?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301431">'The London papers-yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301432">'The <hi rend="italic">Blankhampton Daily Herald</hi>, I mean,' he answered, taking a copy out of his pocket and pointing to the advertisement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301433">As Miss Chillingly read, an angry light came into her eyes, and she bit her lips nervously. So Mr. Lucian had simply been trying to make a fool of her. Well, thank goodness, she had not intended to go.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301434">She laid the paper down and walked to the window, whither Geoffry followed her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301435">'He will never jump over <hi rend="italic">that</hi>,' she said, with a look at the sign.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301436">'I should think not,' Geoffry answered.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301437" n="139     THE SIGN OF THE GOLDEN SWAN"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301438">'Why is he going to attempt it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301439">'I really cannot say.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301440">And so they waited and waited, until three of the clock struck—the hero of the day did not appear. The crowd began to grow impatient; so did Rosey Chillingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301441">'Is he coming, do you think?' she asked at last.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301442">'I dare say not,' said Geoffry coolly. 'He has a trick of forgetting his appointments.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301443">Again she turned to the window with that sudden flush upon her face. Geoffry took advantage of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301444">'Rosey,' he said, in a low tone (they were alone, for Mrs. Chillingly had gone out of the room to fetch something), 'can you forgive me for what took place two years ago? It has made me very unhappy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301445">'Has it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301446">Then somehow his arms found their way round her, and she felt his passionate kisses upon her lips. Poor 'Alphabet,' waiting savagely in the wind about the Seven Willows, was quite forgotten by both of them, until a series of groans and hisses from without recalled them to what was going on in the street.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301447">'They have given him up,' she cried; 'the men are taking the mattresses away. Oh, I do believe, Geoffry, it is all a hoax!' At which Geoffry burst out laughing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301448">Yes; it was all a hoax. Towards five o'clock Mr. Abdy found his way into the room to see the lovers sitting together on the sofa, and Mrs. Chillingly busy writing a letter. Unfortunately, the homely comfort in the cosy room was too much for him, and he lost his temper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301449">'Of course, you have had a fine view of all this foolery that has been going on,' he said to Rosey.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301450">'Well, we saw the preparations and the crowd,' she answered; 'but you never came—why did you not?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301451">'It is a hoax,' he almost shouted. 'I have been nearly mobbed on my way here; but, never mind, I know whom to thank for it, and I'll be even with him yet;' at which Geoffry burst into a fit of smothered laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301453">'Oh, don't be angry,' the girl said soothingly. 'If it was only meant as a joke, you should take it as such. "Give and take," you know, should be the motto for the army.' But, well meant as her sympathy undoubtedly was, the sight of 'Lucy's' livid face and flaming eyes was too much for her, and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301452" n="140     CAVALRY LIFE"/>she, too, relapsed into a perfect agony of hilarity, in the midst of which the enraged officer rushed out of the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301454">'I hope I shall never see him again,' she laughed, 'for I shall never be able to keep a grave face. Oh, won't he pay you out for this!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301455">'Not he,' returned Geoffry carelessly, 'because I shall not give him the chance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301456">After dinner that evening he announced his engagement to his comrades, receiving the congratulations of everyone present excepting Abdy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301457">'Won't you wish me joy, Abdy?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301458">'No, sir; and, what is more, I shall report this disgraceful hoax to the Colonel to-morrow,' he thundered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301459">'Very well,' returned Bernard carelessly. 'You might as well be pleasant about it, for I shall leave the regiment immediately; and, if it's any comfort to you to know it, you never had a chance from the first.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301460">That was quite true, but during his whole life Lucian Abdy cherished the most bitter hatred against his successful rival, and if anyone desired to throw him into a transport of rage he had only to mention the hoax, which, as he thought, cost him the heiress—the sign of the Golden Swan!</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_064" n="11" type="story"><head>HUMPTY-DUMPTY.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301461">WHEN he first joined the regiment he was called 'Fatima,' but before very long his <hi rend="italic">nom de fantasie</hi> was changed to 'Waugh.'

Now—my deadliest enemy—ah, excuse the twagic element—could hardly accuse—<hi rend="italic">me</hi>—of being vivacious.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301482">'By George, no!' put in Hills, amid a roar of laughter.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301483" n="142     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301484">'And "Champagne Charlie" was—undeniably—a cad—and I weally don't think,' he went on plaintively, 'that I am—a cad.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301485">'Perhaps you intend to go as Hadonis?' put in a rough voice from the extreme end of the table; it belonged to the Quartermaster.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301486">Carruthers turned his melancholy dark eyes upon the speaker, with just the faintest expression of contempt on his handsome face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301487">'Ah, no—I had—some thoughts of—er—taking your role—that is, if you don't mind lending it to me once in a way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301488">'Oh no, not at all; what is it?' Groves replied, seeing his way to what might be a good thing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301489">It was a good thing, but scarcely in the way he expected, for, after a long pause, Carruthers said gently:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301490">'I—er—thought of going—<hi rend="italic">as</hi>—<hi rend="italic">sixty</hi>—<hi rend="italic">per cent.!</hi> And I fancy I had the bwute there,' he added in an undertone, for the benefit of the others, who—most of them—knew what it was to borrow money from the gentleman in question, at something like <hi rend="italic">sixty per cent</hi>, interest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301491">As the days passed by, the fancy ball was the subject uppermost in everyone's thoughts, and many were the suggestions for 'Waugh's' costume: one thought the 'Fat Boy in "Pickwick,"' another 'Magog'—only where was Gog to come from, the Drab Horse not being able to produce him?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301492">'Waugh,' however, put all their ideas to flight by announcing grandly that he intended to go as <hi rend="italic">Cœur de Lion!</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301493">'<hi rend="italic">Cœur de Lion</hi>?' repeated Carruthers, for once taken aback.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301494">'Bless my soul!' put in Hills again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301495">'Take my advice, Carruthers,' quoth 'Waugh' dryly, 'and go as "Champagne Charlie."' And then he bolted out of the room before any of the men assembled could answer him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301496">'<hi rend="italic">Cœur de Lion</hi>,' Carruthers said again; 'but—oh, by—Jove! —you never shall.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301497">In his desire to be emphatic he was quite eager—he almost forgot his drawl.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301498">Captain Carruthers said nothing more upon the subject that afternoon. It wanted but three days to the ball, and many were the speculations as to how he would manage to prevent Desmond from being present in the character of <hi rend="italic">Cœur de Lion</hi>; that he might be unable to do so never occurred to them—they knew him too well for that.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301499" n="143     HUMPTY-DUMPTY"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301500">That evening Carruthers sat next to Desmond at dinner, a most unusual circumstance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301501">'Carruthers means mischief,' remarked one officer to another. 'Just watch him keep filling up "Waugh's" glass every time he turns his head.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301502">'"Waugh's" screwed already,' responded the other.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301503">But Desmond proved that he was not more than half-seas-over, and, as the refilling process went steadily on, he very soon showed that he was <hi rend="italic">all</hi>-seas-over by rising to make a speech, and, after stammering out "Gentlemen, I—I—" collapsed, all of a lump, under the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301504">'The beast's drunk again,' said Carruthers disdainfully; 'here, some of you fellows, get him off to bed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301505">So off half a dozen men carried him, swinging him up and down, and shouting at the top of their healthy voices:</p><q><l>'With a hilly-haulee, hilly-haulee, ho!'</l></q><milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301506">'Officers' call ' had just sounded, and the officers of the Drab Horse had assembled in the orderly-room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301507">'Where is Mr. Desmond?' asked the chief.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301508">Mr. Desmond was not forthcoming, that was evident.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301509">'Orderly, go and let Mr. Desmond know that "officers' call" has sounded.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301510">The orderly departed hastily, and, after an absence of five minutes or so, returned with a purple face and without Mr. Desmond.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301511">'Mr. Desmond says he can't come, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301512">A look of astonishment passed among the officers, and Colonel Norreys, for a moment, positively stared at the orderly, as if he could not believe his ears.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301513">'God bless my life and soul, sir!' he thundered. 'Am I the commanding officer of this regiment or NOT? <hi rend="italic">Can't come!</hi> Upon my word, the service is coming to a pretty pass; an officer <hi rend="italic">can't come</hi> when I send for him. Mr. Hills, have the goodness to tell Mr. Desmond to come here immediately. <hi rend="italic">Can't come</hi>! Upon my soul!' etc., <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> until Hills returned, quicker than the orderly had done, but, if anything, slightly more purple about the face, and with eyes steadily bent downwards, and lips tightly compressed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301514">'Mr. Desmond will be here in a moment, sir,' he said to the irate chief.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301515" n="144     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301516">'In a moment!' he growled, turning angrily as the door opened to admit the culprit.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301517">'Now, Mr. Desmond—er—why! God bless me—what—<hi rend="italic">the</hi> devil!—'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301518">His interjaculatory remarks were lost amidst a smothered explosion of laughter from the officers, in which he himself, though he gallantly tried to keep grave, was compelled to join. The only person in the room who did not laugh was James Desmond. There he stood, in his undress, with his forage-cap stuck jauntily on one side of a perfectly bald head; his long moustache had disappeared, also his short whiskers, hair, eyebrows—it was all as bare as the back of your hand! Yes, there he was, with his great round red face, his little pug nose, with one arm akimbo, the other hanging by his side—the personification of 'Humpty-Dumpty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301519">I have said that the only person in the room who did not laugh was Desmond, but I must make another exception— that one was Carruthers, who put his glass carefully in his eye and surveyed his comrade gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301520">'By—Jove!' he remarked at length, then dropped his glass and looked at nothing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301521">'What is the meaning of this, sir?' the chief demanded, making a great effort to keep his countenance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301522">'You know as much as I do, sir,' Desmond replied grandiloquently, looking only at his commanding officer, and folding his arms, in which position he looked so supremely absurd that the smothered mirth bubbled out again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301523">By a mighty effort Colonel Norreys frowned his officers into silence once more, and turned to the indignant 'Waugh.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301524">'Let me hear about it,' he said sternly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301525">'I went to bed as usual last night, sir, 'he answered,' and this morning, when my servant came in, he dropped his can of water and rushed out of the room. I thought that perhaps he might be ill, but when I got up and looked in the glass, I perceived the cause.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301526">'And you mean to tell me that such a change could be brought about without your having <hi rend="italic">some</hi> idea of what was going on?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301527">'I do, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301528">'Humph!' Colonel Norreys' face was a very expressive one, and he looked more than sceptical on the point. 'You say you went to bed as usual last evening?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301529" n="145     HUMPTY-DUMPTY"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301530">'As usual,' returned Desmond.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301531">'Humph! Well, gentlemen, you are all subject to suspicion in this affair. I must ask you if you considered Mr. Desmond "as usual" when he retired from the mess-room?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301532">'Mr. Desmond,' answered Carruthers calmly, 'was considerably the worse for champagne when he left the mess-room last evening.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301533">'Ah!' muttered the chief comprehensively. 'Does that mean that he was drunk?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301534">'<hi rend="italic">Vervy</hi>—dwunk,' returned Carruthers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301535">'Ah!' remarked the chief again, if possible with more comprehension than before. 'Mr. Paget,' addressing a notorious practical joker, 'may I ask why you are laughing?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301536">Paget pulled himself up and straightened his face, without making any reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301537">'This is a very serious matter,' said the Colonel gravely, whereupon Desmond gave a malignant leer at his brother officers. 'Mr. Desmond goes to bed very drunk, and gets up in the morning minus his <hi rend="italic">hair</hi>. Either he has done it himself, or the blame rests with one or more of you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301538">A murmur of denial ran along the line, only Carruthers put his handsome nose two inches higher, without condescending to speak.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301539">'You hear, Mr. Desmond?' said the Colonel coldly. 'This is not the first time I have had to speak to you about playing pranks with your personal appearance. However, since your experiment this time has failed as signally as did a previous one, I will give you a couple of months' leave, and request you to return to your duty a less conspicuous object than you appear at present. You are excused all duty to-day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301540">Surely that was the most cruel part of it all. Some ten years before 'Waugh' had been intensely desirous of possessing a moustache, and, since Dame Nature considered him too young to have the coveted adornment, he had denounced her for an old-fashioned stupid, and foregathered with the regimental surgeon, who told him, in strict confidence, that he had a recipe which would bring out a pair of moustaches with the rapidity of lightning.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301541">'It will sting a bit, but you mustn't mind that,' said the surgeon gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301543">'Waugh' was heroic. Bless you! he didn't mind a little <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301542" n="146     CAVALRY LIFE"/>mere pain. What would that be in comparison to the delight of having a pair of moustaches of his very own?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301544">Reader, do you know what a cantharides blister is? Well, that was what Dr. Hale gave 'Waugh' to bring out his moustaches! It didn't hurt him at first, and he put it neatly along his upper lip, with a little defiant twirl at either end, to make him look fierce. But he didn't look fierce very long; the blister did that part of the business. In vain did 'Waugh' writhe and tug; he couldn't move it. It held on to his unfortunate upper lip like grim death or a leech, until eventually the epidermis thought the discussion not worth going on with, so bade a friendly adieu to the <hi rend="italic">cutis vera</hi>, and set off on his travels with the blister. That was bad enough, but the roars of laughter which greeted him when he appeared at breakfast the next morning, with a clearly-defined raw patch, just the shape of a moustache, extending along his upper lip and perfectly correct in detail, even to the knowing little twirl at either extremity, they were much worse.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301545">And to have that raked up now, and made an excuse to let the real culprits off!—Desmond felt and said, in no measured terms, that it was disgraceful—utterly disgraceful!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301546">But it was no use attempting to argue the point with the Colonel, so he took himself off on his leave in dignified silence and—a wig, returning at the expiration of it looking all the better for his mysterious shave, for his hair, which before had been persistently straight, grew curly, and really improved his appearance immensely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301547">And thus, though he did not go to the fancy ball in any character, life, so far as he was concerned, was a perpetual fancy ball; for as long as he remained in the regiment he was never allowed to forget how he had once appeared in the character of 'Humpty-Dumpty.' And—he never got drunk again as long as he lived.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_065" n="12" type="story"><head>A REGIMENTAL AUTOCRAT.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301548">WHO was he? Why, the Colonel, of course. What other man in that big family of overgrown children occupies the proud position of absolute monarchy? And what was his name? Thomas Crêvecœur.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301550">He was an autocrat—an absolute monarch—a martinet of the fiercest and most unreasonable description, and he com-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301549" n="147     A REGIMENTAL AUTOCRAT"/>manded the gallant regiment known as the 18th (Royal) Dragoons. Behind his back they called him 'Tommy,' 'Our old man,' 'Old Fireworks,' and the like; but to his face it was 'Yes, Colonel,' and 'No, Colonel,' in the most mealy-mouthed manner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301551">Occasionally the youngsters played very judicious pranks on him; that is to say, when 'Tommy' got three sheets in the wind he was wont to unbend considerably, and they therefore had to fall in with his humour, and if he joked—joke back again; but it was unsatisfactory work—so akin to playing with lighted matches over an open barrel of gunpowder.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301552">Well, one evening, after an extra big night, Colonel Crêvecœur retired to his rooms, rather nearer to being half-seas-over than was usual even with him, who could stow away a bottle of cognac a day with ease and comfort. He was desperately sleepy—almost too sleepy to walk at all; the night was awfully cold; on the ground outside the snow lay thick, and the fires in his rooms burnt brilliantly—as fires do in frosty weather—casting a mellow, pleasant glow over everything. Up to the sitting-room fireplace Colonel Crêvecœur went, meandering thereto in graceful curves, which so delighted him that he unburdened his soul by a burst of language popularly called 'choice Italian.' And, somehow, his legs seemed more inclined to continue the graceful meandering movements than the rest of him did, so he caught at the chimney-piece to steady himself, a liberty which—as it was merely a sham shelf of wood and fringe, put to hide the hideous regulation finish to the hideous regulation grate—that article promptly resented by breaking down, with all its freight of letters, horseshoes, candlesticks, photograph frames, and odd little Indian ornaments and figures. Happily, the glass was safely screwed to the wall, and the fire happening to flicker up just then into a brilliant blaze, Colonel Crêvecœur caught sight of his own handsome countenance, and suddenly became aware that he had been having too much.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301553">'What a demned red face you've got, Crêvecœur, my boy!' he remarked confidentially, gazing idiotically at the reflection of cheeks flushed scarlet, white moustaches fiercely waxed, and close-cropped white hair, all rumpled upon end.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301554">'Been having too much—very wrong—shouldn't do it—bad example to set the young uns—gerrabed—gerrabed—sooner the better.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301555" n="148     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301556">Now, since a roaring fire was alight in each of the rooms, the use of a candle was entirely superfluous; but Colonel Crêvecœur, being as great a state of absent-mindedness as was ever Sir Isaac Newton when he made the little hole for the kitten—though, to be sure, the cause was a very different one—troubled himself to stoop for a candle and stick from among the débris on the floor. He fished up the stick first; then the candle. But, alas! the candle was broken, and, being slightly too small for the candlestick, required fitting to a greater nicety than his head was capable at that moment of conceiving or his fingers of carrying out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301557">'Demn the candlestick!' said Colonel Crêvecœur, flinging it across the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301558">Still, it did not occur to him to betake himself to bed without any extra light; stooping, he placed the broken candle between the bars, with the effect of making a big blaze in the fire, but none where he wanted it, at the end of the candle.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301559">'Demn the candle!' he exclaimed, tossing it into the fire; then sat himself down to recover his breath—his eyes closed, and in two minutes he was off to sleep as sound as a church.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301560">He must have slept for about a couple of hours; for he awoke, with a start, to find the fire burned very low in the grate, the room in darkness, and the big clock in the gate-tower striking three.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301561">Colonel Crêvecœur sat up in his chair, as sober as a judge. 'I must have been asleep,' he muttered; 'Gad! how deuced cold it is!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301562">As he passed the window to go into the next room, he drew aside the curtain to look at the night. The square was as light as day-on the great expanse of newly-fallen snow the full moon shone down bravely, bringing each sentry-box and each snow-capped range of troop-rooms into view, with the startling distinctness of a photograph.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301563">He only stood there for a moment, but, as ill luck would have it, a man in plain clothes came quietly out from between the chief block of officers' quarters and the commanding officers' house, and passed quickly towards the nearest troop- room—<hi rend="italic">unchallenged</hi> by the sentry immediately below Colonel Crêvecœur's window. He did what, of course, any other commanding officer in the service would have done: he flung up his window and demanded angrily the reason of the non-challenge.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301564" n="149     A REGIMENTAL AUTOCRAT"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301565">'I didn't hear him, sir,' stammered the unfortunate sentry, in dismay.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301566">'You—didn't—hear—him,' in tones of the most withering scorn, 'and what the devil did you mean by <hi rend="italic">not</hi> hearing him, sir? What are you there for, sir? Who is he? What is he doing out, prowling about at this time of night? Up to no good, I'll be bound. I'll not have men prowling about at all hours.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301567">The man in plain clothes had quickly enough vanished at the first sound of the Colonel's voice, but the old autocrat was not going to be done in that fashion. It was just the time for relieving guard, and whilst he was yet speaking the corporal of the guard made his appearance and performed that ceremony.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301568">'Put this man under arrest!' thundered the autocrat, 'and turn the guard out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301569">So there was a scurry back to the guard-room, a hoarse 'Guar-r-r-r-r-d tur-r-r-r-n out,' a great scramble and scuffling and catching up of carbines plainly audible across the silent square—then a tramp of spurred heels, as the guard marched down to the commanding officer's quarters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301570">'Sound réveilé!' shouted the Colonel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301571">Out rang the trumpets and out came the regiment wondering if a big riot was on, or a monster fire, or maybe an invasion. But, after all, it was but a great to-do about nothing! Who had been out in the square during the past half-hour?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301572">The delinquent stood out instanter. 'Me, sir,' he announced, without any circumlocution whatever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301573">'Oh, <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>' with a frightful sneer on his handsome old face, 'and, pray, what were you doing out of your quarters at this hour?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301574">'I'm Mr. Bartholomew's servant, sir,' the man explained; I've been helping Dr. Scott to put 'ot flannins on 'im, but when he drorped orf to sleep the doctor said I might as well go to bed, as he could do werry well by his-self for the rest of the night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301575">Now, as young Bartholomew was suffering from a severe attack of inflammation of the lungs, there was nothing further to be said; therefore, with a very bad word, the old Colonel banged down his window, not even condescending to dismiss the regiment, and whilst the orderly officer was hesitating whether to take that responsibility upon himself, one of the men broke into a hearty laugh.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301576" n="150     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301577">Up went the window again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301578">'Ah, ah, my fine fellow, I'll teach you to laugh on the other side of your mouth!' the Colonel roared. 'Mr. Mordaunt, let the regiment be ready in full marching order in half an hour.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301579">Full marching order, at three in the morning, with the thermometer at ten degrees below zero, and snow a foot deep on the ground! In two minutes that barrack might, with reason, have been likened to Pandemonium; such a cursing, such a swearing in truth, in the space of five short minutes you might have heard as great a variety of oaths as would have served to fill this volume; such a hasty blacking of boots; such a polishing of helmets; such groanings over soiled gloves and facings, which there was no time to clean; such a hurrying; such a scampering of orderlies to apprise the married officers living in the town; such a rousing of whole streets to find the married men living out of barracks; such a grooming and stamping and kicking of sleepy, frightened horses; such a plunging and slipping and neighing, until at last they were ready to start.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301580">All through the town! Such a flinging up of windows; such thrusting out of sleepy heads to know if an enemy had suddenly invaded the country; such wonder as the loud strains of 'Auld Lang Syne' and 'The girl I leave behind me' rang out upon the frosty air; such bitter tears of sweet little modest maidens, who did not like to appear <hi rend="italic">en demitoilette</hi>, and made sure the brave 18th were off to India at least; such hurried mental totting up of unpaid bills!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301582">Then out into the country! Rousing the inhabitants of village after village, and making them wonder if the Queen was dead, that the soldiers made so much fuss! One—two—three—four—five—six—seven long, slippery, dismal, miserable miles by a round which brought them back through the town again, where the worst was to come. A good mile from the town clouds quickly drifted across the moon, and the snow began to fall again in heavy, blinding wreaths; several horses suddenly became utterly unmanageable and frantic, lashing out every minute when they were not stumbling, and stumbling when they were not occupied in kicking—one fell, breaking his rider's leg in two places in the fall; a second came down a couple of hundred yards further on, smashing a fore-leg horribly; a third ran his head bang against a lamppost, tumbling over as dead as a door-nail, at which another <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301581" n="151     A REGIMENTAL AUTOCRAT"/>terrified animal made a clean bolt of it and tried to jump a house, with the result of turning a somersault and landing in the gutter with a broken back, jerking his rider off, with, happily, no more serious injury than a couple of broken ribs.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301583">It was a ghastly night's work, and truly morning light rose upon a ghastly sight. Three gallant chargers lay stretched stiff and stark upon the trampled blood-stained road; two hospital cots were filled that before had been empty; anger and disgust was on every face, well-nigh rebellion and mutiny in every heart!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301584">Amongst it all, Colonel Crêvecoeur stalked, grim, silent, vigilant, like an avenging spirit—a mighty big spirit for such a very trivial misdemeanour.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301585">In due course the story was wafted to headquarters, with what effect never transpired. The dignity and the authority of a commanding officer must be kept up, of course—yet many in the regiment suspected that when, not many weeks later, Major Forde was gazetted to the command of the regiment, <hi rend="italic">vice</hi> Thomas Crêvœcur, resigned, the retirement had been politely compulsory.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301586">So he passed out of the regiment which he had ruled so long with a rod of iron, and with him—with one exception—passed away the last of the old race of martinets.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_066" n="13" type="story"><head>HIS PRINCESS.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301587">DICK CARTER stood in front of the anteroom fire, with his hands behind his back. It was Christmas Eve, and on the last day of the year the regiment was to sail for India's coral strand. For his part, Dick wished India's coral strand was at the deuce; but, then, since neither his nor any other Cuirassier's wishes could alter either the position of India's coral strand or the sending thither of the regiment, Dick had no alternative but to accept the situation, which he did with much swearing—what his Princess called 'choice Italian.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301588">'Who is to have the depot?' someone asked presently; 'are you, Carter?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301589">'Can't afford it; I've too many of those beastly bills.

Mrs. Hey was, I fancy, rather taken aback by the prospect of the daily dinner, and gasped out "Oh, lor!"'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301595">A perfect roar of laughter greeted the words, and he continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301596">'They neither of them saw me for ever so long, and then Mrs. Hey made a clean bolt of it. I wasn't sorry, for I'd been wanting to laugh for some time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301597">The only one who did not join in the laughter was Dick Carter, who, still before the fire, was gazing abstractedly out of the window, past the rows of ugly barrack buildings, to the murky sky beyond. Almost unconsciously his lips screwed themselves up, and he whistled softly the notes of a song which he had heard the night before:</p><q><l>'Will you think of me, and love me, as you did once long ago?'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301598">'Curse it!' said Dick savagely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301599">'What?' Scott asked innocently, never thinking of the words of the song; indeed, it was doubtful if he knew them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301600">'Oh, everything, 'Dick returned volubly; 'India—bills—everything.' But, all the same, it was neither India nor the bills which made that vigorous anathema slip off his tongue just then.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301601">He snatched up the poker and stirred the fire energetically; to speak with entire correctness, he did not stir the fire at all, but smashed it, as if it was the coral strand of India, and he had a special mission to send it to the deuce.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301603">Then, seeing that the chatter of voices had gone on again, he straightened himself up once more, and went back to his occupation of watching the sky, thinking the while. He had one or two very unpalatable things to think about just then: first of all, there were his bills—not that he objected in a few bills; he had had them, bless you! eversince the days when he had emerged from frocks and tunics into knickerbockers; he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301602" n="153     HIS PRINCESS"/>would have bills, as he very well knew, to the end of the chapter; he rather liked them, there was something so uncomfortable in paying ready money, counting out the coins, haggling over the change, and getting discount. Dick felt rather ashamed of that discount; but then, to be sure, the times when he had received it were few and far between—like angels' visits. No! he hadn't the least objection in the world to a few bills; he had never been what he called 'a ready-money devil'; but, unfortunately, there were other people concerned who were not so easy-going as Dick was—those were the creditors. He had been forced to put his pride in his pocket a good many times of late, and, like several others of the Cuirassiers, he knew that if he could manage to get on board the <hi rend="italic">Jumna</hi> without being arrested, he should consider himself very lucky. Then, besides the bills, he would have on the morrow to be present at the men's dinner—just to say a word to them; and on the following day he would have to make a regular speech, for he was to give a dinner to his troop, which would cost a lot of money: not that he grudged a few pounds; but he was so awfully hard-up just then, there was no doubt about it. Well, he supposed he should get over the bills and the confounded speech in time; but there was another matter at which Dick could not look so philosophically. Unconsciously his whistling broke out again—'<hi rend="italic">Che faro senza Euridice</hi>——' but there he stopped with a suddenness which was a shriek of pain in miniature, and stood looking blindly at nothing, with such pain in his blue eyes that it would have made your heart ache to see it. Not that his brother officers noticed anything, more than that 'Carter was down in the mouth to-day, poor chap!' They were busy, one in retailing, the others in listening to, the story of a quarrel which Captain Long had had with his wife that morning, and which Mr. Scott had overheard from his room, which stood at right angles to the Longs' dining-room. What do you say? you don't believe cavalry officers descend to such little mean tittle-tattling as to discuss matrimonial squabbles? Then, that only shows all you know about cavalry officers!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301605">Ordinarily, Dick Carter was as good a hand at talking scandal as any officer in the regiment; but on that occasion his mind was otherwise engaged. He was wondering how he was to get over the parting with his Princess. A fine fellow he was, this same Dick, lithe of limb, tall of stature—for he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301604" n="154     CAVALRY LIFE"/>was but slightly under six feet, square in the chest, strong, graceful, careless—a very beau-ideal of a cavalry officer—with a sensible face, clean-shaven, save for a heavy moustache of reddish-brown, a face which would have been handsome had it not been for a certain squareness in the jaw, but which could not be thought ugly, for the beauty of the keen blue eyes and the brightness of the fair hair above it. Looking at him for the first time across a room or a street, your first impulse would probably lead you to remark, 'What an ill-tempered, haughty face!' but if you were brought close to him, and he wished to be civil—that just made all the difference in Dick—in two minutes you would be entirely won by his fascinating smile; but then, perhaps, his persuasive voice and manner might have had a good deal to do with the change.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301606">And whilst Dick was thinking rather dismally of the immediate future, the orderly officer for the day entered hastily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301607">'Oh, you're here, Carter!' he exclaimed. 'There's an uncommonly suspicious-looking chap asking for you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301608">'Where? Who?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301609">Dick was on the alert in an instant; for a moment his Princess was forgotten.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301610">'A writ, I should say,' Havers laughed; 'and the bearer of it has just been bundled ignominiously out of your room by your man, who informed him you had gone to Paris, and were not coming back to England at all, but would join the regiment at Malta.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301611">'Clever chap!' Dick murmured, as he put on his hat and caught up his gloves and stick, departing hastily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301612">It was but a step from the back-door of the mess-rooms to the house in which he was quartered. Dick's long legs took him up the stairs four steps at a time, and with such haste that he almost annihilated Craddock, who was occupied in washing the flagged landing between his master's rooms and those of Mr. Scott. He paused in his task, and sat back upon his heels with the flannel floor-cloth in his hands.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301613">'Just had a bum-bailiff here, sir,' he said coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301614">'Yes, hang it! I know,' returned Dick savagely. 'Can you keep him out if he comes back here, do you think?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301615">'I'll punch his 'ed if he comes up my steps,' Craddock replied in a matter-of-fact tone, though a slow smile of delight overspread his fresh, good-looking countenance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301616">Dick laughed outright. 'All right, then, I'll trust to you.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301617" n="155     HIS PRINCESS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301618">'Very well, sir;' and Craddock went on deliberately washing the landing and then the stairs.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301619">In order that he might hear anything which transpired, Dick left his door open, and presently he heard an oily voice asking if Lieutenant Carter had come <hi rend="italic">yet</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301620">'<hi rend="italic">No;</hi> Leefetenant Carter hain't come <hi rend="italic">yet</hi>,' replied Craddock calmly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301621">'I've heerd as 'ow he's in this 'ouse,' remonstrated the visitor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301622">'Oh! you're like for to know best,' was the sarcastic reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301623">'I must come up and see for myself,' he went on, emboldened by Craddock's unlooked-for mildness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301624">'Oh, yer must, must yer? Then, let me tell yer, me fine gentleman, that I'm a 'onest dragoon what serves her Majesty the Queen, and I don't take Government pay for washing steps for the likes of you to walk up and down.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301625">'Oh, I won't make no dirt,' the bum promised eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301626">'I don't expect yer will,' returned Craddock affably.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301627">Now, the emissary of the law—I suppose a bum-bailiff is an emissary of the law—being a small spare man of ten stone or so, felt that a personal contest with a dragoon standing over six feet in his socks, and riding about thirteen-stone-ten, would hardly suit his purpose; therefore, taking up his position against the jamb of the outer door, he proceeded to try and discover whether Craddock was of the class which, like the deaf adder, refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer, or whether he was open to blarney. Now, upon certain occasions, Craddock was open to blarney, but, then, that was when the donor of it was of the softer sex; to a bum-bailiff Craddock was as hard as iron.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301628">'It's very bad sort of weather,' remarked the emissary pleasantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301629">Excepting for a suppressed growl, Craddock did not condescend to return any reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301630">'Sort of weather when one wants something warm inside, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301631">'You'll get something warm <hi rend="italic">out</hi>side if you hain't orf soon,' returned Craddock.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301632">'Did you feel dry at all?' said the emissary presently, ignoring his opponent's last remark. 'I must admit I feels dry myself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301634">'Ah!there's a pump over yonder at the stables,' answered <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301633" n="156     CAVALRY LIFE"/>Craddock significantly, 'and there's some water in this 'ere bucket, though, to be sure, it hain't over-clean.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301635">Having finished off the first half of the stairs, he rose from his knees, stretched himself, and coolly planted his back against the wall. Seeing that, the emissary returned to the charge again, this time with a ludicrous assumption of authority which made Dick and his man both laugh out aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301636">'Come, come, young man, you must let me come up them stairs.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301637">'You'd better try, that's all,' said Craddock.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301638">'I know Lieutenant Carter's up there.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301639">'Leefetenant Carter <hi rend="italic">hain't</hi> up there, I tell yer!' thundered Craddock, with utter disregard for the punishment in store for fabricators.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301640">'Now, look 'ere'—speaking confidently—'I'll give you 'arf a crown for yourself, if you'll let me come up them stairs.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301641">'Chuck us yer 'arf-crown,' answered the dragoon suspiciously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301642">With much fumbling the emissary produced a shilling, which he held poised on his finger.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301643">'Arf a crown,' said Craddock stolidly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301644">'Say a florin.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301645">''Arf a crown,' was the dogged reply; ' not a ha'penny less.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301646">After a good deal of circumlocution, the half-crown was thrown from the emissary to the servant. Dick, leaning against the door of his room, wondered what was coming next.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301647">'Now I've paid up fair, so let me see into them rooms,' said the emissary eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301648">Craddock cast a glance of most thorough contempt at him, and dipped his floor-cloth once more into the bucket. 'I'll see you d——d first!' he returned deliberately, as he wrung it out, and went on washing the landing, at which Dick burst into a wild fit of uncontrollable laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301649">Craddock glanced up carelessly. 'It's all very fine for you to laugh, Jinks,' he said, in his stolid, imperturbable way; 'it hain't your turn to wash the steps down, or maybe it wouldn't be so funny. Is Mr. Scott's mastiff in his room?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301650">'Yes,' grunted Dick, disguising his voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301652">'Then, just let 'im out, there's a good chap; he'll make pretty short work of this cove down here.' Then, as Dick opened Scott's door, ' 'Ere, Lion, come along—set 'em <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301651" n="157     HIS PRINCESS"/>Orf——' But the emissary had departed, a good deal faster
than his wont.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301653">Seeing the result of his ruse, Craddock sat down on the stairs and just roared with laughter, till he could roar no longer; and Mr. Scott, going in, found the laughter of master and man so irresistible that he could not ask what was the joke for the merriment which absolutely choked him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301654">'Craddock, go and see which way the brute's gone,' said Dick presently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301655">'Just going out of the gates, sir,'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301656">'Then, come along,' cried Scott hastily. 'There's a cab just driven up to the mess, and I told him to wait, thinking you might want it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301657">'Thanks, old man,' said Dick gratefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301658">For the present the danger was over. As they drove towards the gates, Dick uttered a sigh of relief—a sigh which quickly, however, turned to one of impatience, as a few bars of 'Auld Lang Syne ' floated out from one of the buildings they passed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301659">'Practising that thing already,' Dick said, with what was almost a groan. 'Goodness knows, it's bad enough when it comes to the last, without hearing it every day for three weeks previously.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301660">'Auld Lang Syne' was the farewell air when the Cuirassiers departed from old quarters for fresh ones. Like many another, Dick hated it as though it were poison, but he had never before detested it so cordially as he did then. I know one regiment which always used to play ' When other lips and other hearts'—I dare say they play it still, only they have been frizzling in India for ten years, so I have not had an opportunity of judging; I knew another which kept to the hackneyed 'Girl I leave behind me'; and another which of late has played ' Sweethearts ' for the march out. Of them all, I consider 'The girl I leave behind' me is the best. There is a certain jollity about it; it is almost impossible to feel affected by it. Once, though, when a gay and gallant regiment, of famous Peninsular and Crimean memory, was leaving a town prior to embarking for India, there was an unusual amount of weeping and wailing over the departing heroes; bitter were the tears shed to the strains, which somehow always make me laugh:</p><q><l>'My love, I will come back again</l><l>To the girl I leave behind me.'</l></q><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301661" n="158     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301662">Oh, the tender partings!—the fond women-folk who clung to the stirrups, and tramped some miles of the way for a last hour together. Oh, the passionate injunctions, 'You'll not forget me, Jack?' I doubt not that under their gay trappings many a poor fellow's heart throbbed painfully, many an eye was dim beneath the shelter of the busby, with an emotion none guessed aught of save themselves. 'A change came o'er the spirit of my dream, and it was eventime.' Past the gate came two girls, who in the morning had been especially and particularly demonstrative in their leave-taking, and with them, if you please, two men of the relieving regiment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301663">'Sarah,' said one to the other, as they passed, 'now, isn't these chaps a deal better than the 'Leventh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301664">''Leventh!—bah!' returned Sarah scornfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301665">Oh, Sarah, Sarah!—I minded me of the sore heart and the moist eyes I had noticed in the moaning, and I was sorry, till I remembered that Jack and Bill were probably playing the same old drama at the first halting-place.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301666">'Where are you going, Dick?' Scott asked, as they neared the town.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301667">'The Swan.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301668">'Ah!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301669">Scott asked no further questions.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301670">Dick's Princess, who with her brother had come to see the last of him, was staying at the Swan.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301671">And what was she like, this Princess? Not handsome, certainly, as Dick once said to her himself: 'You are, perhaps, not exactly handsome'—he had hitherto stoutly maintained that she was—'but then, don't you see, you are the sort of girl that every second man would turn round to look after.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301672">'That's the prettiest compliment anyone ever paid me in my life,' laughed the girl gaily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301673">She was standing by the window as Dick entered the room, a tall girl, in a closely-clinging gown of black—a girl with good dark eyes and a perfect form. She would, perhaps, have been better-looking had the eyes been more often filled with laughter, had there been a less haughty expression of the mouth, less resolution in the whole face, voice, and gestures. She never looked haughty to Dick, though; to him voice and gestures were always tender. When her eyes rested upon him, they always shone with that tender love-light which comes to the eyes of all of us at some period of our lives or other.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301674" n="159     HIS PRINCESS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301675">'Are you going to take me for a walk, Dick?' she asked. 'It is late, but, still, you may as well.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301676">Dick explained the circumstances which had prevented him from going earlier, and added, moreover, that it would be as well, perhaps, not to venture out that day more than was absolutely necessary.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301677">'After to-morrow it won't matter, 'he ended. 'A writ must give eight days in which to pay up, and by that time we shall have sailed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301678">'Oh, Dick!' said the girl, with a suppressed sob. Alas! the love-light had been dimmed by tears very often of late, and there was a suspicious brightness in the dark eyes upturned to him then.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301679">Dick bent down and kissed her very tenderly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301680">'What has my Princess done with all her pluck?' he asked, then hurried on, with an earnestness which showed how little trust he had in himself: 'When it comes to the last, my darling, you won't give way, you'll be strong and brave, that I may be able to keep up, too? You'll just say "Good-bye" quietly, without any fuss?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301681">'I don't know, but I'll try,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301682">'You know, Princess, you are strong and brave, not like some women, who have no pluck. Gather up all your resolution, and let me remember you smiling to the last.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301683">'I only have one weakness,' she said, with a wistful tenderness, which showed how firm a hold upon her that weakness had.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301684">'And that is——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301685">'Yourself,' she replied simply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301686">'And you call me a weakness?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301687">'My love for you is a weakness, because—oh, Dick, you won't go away and forget me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301688">'Of course not. My love, it will soon be over; just two years, till I get my debts paid, and then I shall come home, and we will laugh together at our fears at parting. It will only be two years, Princess—three at most—before I come home to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301690">'You never will,' she said calmly. 'Dick dear, sometimes you wonder that I am low-spirited, what you men call "down in the mouth"'—with a gleam of laughter struggling through the sadness in her eyes; ' but you are careless, and I am not. You, if you have what you wish in the present, are content; you don't look into the future. I do, and I count the hours, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301689" n="160     CAVALRY LIFE"/>almost the moments, that are left to me, because I know that they are the end.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301691">'They are not the end,' he cried passionately; ' when I come back, we will go to Italy together, and then I will make you cry <hi rend="italic">peccavi</hi> for your foolish fancies now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301692">'Yes, we will go to Italy together,' repeated the girl dreamily. 'What a pity it is that we cannot go to Italy now, whilst we are young, whilst we love each other! Oh, what a nuisance money is—how vexed I am that I am poor!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301693">'I don't care!' he said defiantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301694">'Don't you?' she asked wistfully; ' but then, don't you see, you have not any money, either.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301695">'No, by Jove! I haven't; I only wish I had,' he exclaimed ruefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301696">'What a pity one cannot sell one's pedigree!' she said musingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301697">'Is it long? What do you value it at?' he laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301698">'Why, where do you think those came from?' she asked, holding a row of filbert nails just in front of his nose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301699">'Came from? I should think you growed 'em,' he replied, making an effort to kiss the fingers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301700">'Growed 'em, of course; but they don't grow by chance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301701">'No, perhaps not; the Greeks did not admire filbert nails,' he said coolly; 'too near an approach to the claws of a beast, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301702">'I should have given the Greeks credit for more sense,' remarked the Princess superbly; 'but, since I live in the nineteenth century, I am very glad to possess my filberts, without worrying about the ancient Greek.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301703">Just then a knock was heard at the door, to which Dick called out, 'Come in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301704">'There's a gentleman wants to see you, sir,' said the waiter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301705">'A gentleman? What sort of a gentleman?' Dick asked suspiciously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301706">'Well, sir,' returned the man, looking round cautiously, 'it's Mr. Goodenough's clerk.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301707">'And who the dickens is Mr Goodenough?' demanded Dick, rising.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301708">'Oh, he's a lawyer, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301709">'Oh, a lawyer, is he? Well, don't let Mr. Goodenough's clerk come up here, that's all. By-the-by, how did he know I was here?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301710" n="161     HIS PRINCESS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301711">'Saw you come in, I think, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301712">'Ah! where is he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301713">'In the bar.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301714">'Then let him stop, if he likes. I suppose all customers are good for the house, eh?'—with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301715">'Well, yes, sir, of course,' the waiter replied. 'I believe he means to wait until you come out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301716">At this intelligence Dick and the Princess laughed aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301717">'He'll have to wait a good while, then,' Dick laughed. 
'I suppose you've some spare rooms?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301718">'Oh yes, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301719">'Then, I'll sleep here to-night. I didn't intend to turn my rooms upside down until Monday, but a few days won't make much difference. Don't let that brute up here, waiter, that's all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301720">'Well, sir, I'll try, of course; but if he insists on coming up?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301721">'These are <hi rend="italic">my</hi> rooms,' put in the Princess with sudden dignity; 'you had better tell him that these are Mr. Villiers' rooms, and that he cannot enter them. I wish,'she continued to Dick, 'that Jack would come in; I don't know where he has gone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301722">'Oh, it's all right,' he laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301723">'I should have thought, now,' she went on plaintively, 'that you were quite capable of breaking a clerk's head for him; when I first knew you, you used to talk very largely about twisting anyone's neck who presumed to look twice at me, but it seems to have been all idle swagger.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301724">'Oh, I would break his head or twist his neck with the greatest pleasure, only, don't you see, if he sees me, he will be able to serve the writ on me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301725">'Oh, I didn't know,' she said rather blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301726">Presently the waiter came back, and, closing the door behind him, set his back against it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301727">'It you please, sir,' he began solemnly, 'he says he won't go away, not if he sits in the bar till morning; and I don't believe he will: he's a determined sort of fellow is Johnson.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301728">'He's very welcome to sit in the bar till he turns to a mummy,' Dick replied politely; 'you can tell him so, with my compliments, if you like.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301729">'Well, sir, but if he steals up here?—I can't be watching the staircase all the day.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301730" n="162     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301731">'Look here, waiter, just keep Mr. Johnson out of my way and I'll give you a sovereign. Here it is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301732">'Well, I'll do my best, sir'—the sovereign had made all the difference to Joseph—'but, if you'll take my advice, you'll keep this door locked, and go in and out through Mr. Villiers' bedroom.' The brother of the Princess occupied an apartment opening out of the sitting-room, and having a second door on to a landing connected with the principal corridor and staircase. 'If he stays, as I think he will, I'll bring dinner up by the billiard-room and the back-stairs.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301733">'What fun!' cried the Princess, clapping her hands as Dick turned the key behind the retreating servitor; 'I feel as if we had gone back a few hundred years and were being besieged—this was the sort of thing my crusading ancestors went in for. It is like the siege of Jerusalem in miniature, only we are on the wrong side of the barricades.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301734">'Did your ancestors go to the Crusades?' Dick asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301735">'Of course! We came over with the Conqueror and did all the Crusade business, and finally settled down in Ireland, intending to become respectable gentry; unfortunately, we got mixed up with royalty, and learned from experience that "he who increaseth riches, increaseth care." The elder branches of the family—the semi-royal family took good care of themselves—couldn't keep to their quiet, respectable country life, but must needs get attainted for high treason, so of course forfeited their estates. Perhaps they had got a few drops of the wild Irish blood mingled with the cool, determined Norman stock—any way, instead of being a belted earl now, Jack is only a poor sailor, with nothing a year but his pay. Our men could never keep their money; they could make it, or, in the elegant fashion of former times, take it, but they could not keep it. My own grandfather, after serving through the Peninsular, after being with Abercombie in Egypt, and with Picton at Waterloo, after being in twenty-four engagements, besides skirmishes, hadn't sense to stick to what he had got, but went and put—"invested" he called it—all his money in some manufacturing concern as a sleeping partner. He woke up one fine morning to find the others gone and himself saddled with all the liabilities—a fine end that was for Abercombie's <hi rend="italic">aide</hi> to come to.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301736">'So your grandfather was an officer?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301738">'Yes; his brother, too; and a good way back on my mother's

It is a very pleasant country all round us if ye army had not distressed ye poor inhabitants so much by their being situate in and near this neighbourhood for two campaigns before this. We expect marching from these quarters in a day or two to a place called Dryburg, which is about sixteen English miles from this, where we are to encamp. The army of the allies are to have three different encampments: one commanded by Duke Ferdinand, the others by the Prince Hereditary and General Sporkon, which are to act in three different ways, to observe the movements of the French army. We are very quiet, and by what appears at present, shall continue so, for at this place there is nothing talked of but a peace. A cornet in this country ought to have, besides his pay, four or five hundred a year. We cannot do with less than five horses, and, if we should have a vigorous campaign, I shall be obliged to keep six horses and three servants. I myself keep two servants besides a dragoon at present, which I pay twenty shillings a week to, and two shillings a week to the dragoon, out of my two pounds two a week. I do assure you this place for a gentleman of ye cavalry is the most expensive I ever saw, for no officer in this regiment can live upon less than twice his pay, but all our gentlemen are men of very great fortunes and never regard the expense, which they are in fact obliged to be at.

Dick took his Princess for long walks—he had now no fear of writs, and they were positively showered upon him—he showed her all the little sights of the place, and she helped him to buy such of his outfit as he had not procured in town; and in time the last afternoon came—the very last time that she would put on her hat and go out with him; the last time they would go into a shop like two children and buy nougat or toffee—the last time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301789">'Dick,' she said, when she came into the sitting-room, dressed for walking, 'let me have the cross.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301790">'Yes, child, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301791">It was an 'Iron Cross of Prussia,' which some friend of Dick's had found in Berlin, and which the Princess had vainly coveted for some time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301792">'Buy me a steel chain to wear with it.

But presently, mindful of her promise to be brave, she went back and held her glass for Dick to fill.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301802">'To our next merry meeting!' she cried courageously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301803">Her tears were all gone; there still lived in the girl some of the cool, determined spirit of her crusading fore-elders, and she had for Dick's sake forced the scalding drops back—it must have been—even to her heart. And so, on that last night, she sang and laughed, wearing a brave smile to hide the utter agony within her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301804">'I want you to keep my helmet for me whilst I am in India,' Dick said, during the course of the evening.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301805">'Very well,' she answered, 'I will take care of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301806">The moments sped quickly on, and midnight had come.

Still, she did not sleep: she heard the clock in the hall strike one—two—three; then, very soon, the sound of the boots—she supposed it was the boots—hammering at Dick's door. Evidently Dick had been already up when the servant went, for when she, a few minutes later, entered the sitting-room, he was there, trying awkwardly to fasten his belts.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301810">'Let me do that,' she said hastily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301811">'Are you there, my darling?' he asked, turning quickly at the sound of her voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301813">She fastened the belts in silence, her shaking fingers scarcely able to perform the task. She spoke no word, only her face grew more and more deathly pale, her eyes more intensely <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301812" n="171     HIS PRINCESS"/>dark,the weight of pain on her heart more and more crushing; once she looked at him, but what she saw in his face made her keep her eyes resolutely away from it: was she not nerving herself to get through the next hour bravely? But the silence was broken at last, when she saw him trying to force some thins into a bag, more than it would hold.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301814">'Let me do that,' she said calmly, taking them out of his hands.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301815">She dared not look at him; the hands trembling so nervously before her told her what she would see if she should look up into his face, and a great tear which fell with a splash upon her wrist warned her that she must be strong, for Dick's strength was fast deserting him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301816">'It is snowing fast,' Dick said, turning to the window, and drawing aside the curtain.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301817">'Is it?' said the girl; her voice sounded almost indifferent, so great was her effort to keep her tears back. Oh, if he would but go now! she thought passionately—now, without a word.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301818">But Dick did not. He crossed the room to her side, and stood watching her packing the bag.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301819">'Linda!' he said, using her name almost for the first time since he had known her—for he had passed from 'Miss Villiers' to 'My Princess'—'darling, it has come.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301820">She dropped the bag and its contents, and turned to him, looking then with sad, hungry eyes into his white, quivering face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301821">'You—won't—forget—me,' she managed to say; 'you'll—think of me—sometimes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301822">But Dick never answered; he took her in his arms for a moment, as if he would never, never let her go again. The girl felt her head swimming, and her heart sinking yet lower—then her kisses, the last she would ever give him, fell upon the brass guard of his helmet, and its icy coldness brought her to herself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301823">It was all over then; at the door he turned and looked at her for the last time. A pair of blue eyes beneath an Indian helmet, a pair of dark ones under a mass of red-brown hair, and in both such dire misery that I can write no more. The door closed, and he was gone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301825">She heard him clatter down the stairs and tramp along the stone-floored hall; then she ran to the window and flung it <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301824" n="172     CAVALRY LIFE"/>open wide for yet the very last look. The tall, soldierly figure passed out of sight amid the driving snow; but the girl sank on her knees and stayed there, half unconscious of aught but that the end had come. Jack, coming out of his room, found her there, wet with snow and almost frozen to death.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301826">'Come in, old woman,' he said persuasively; 'you will get your death.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301827">'I am past that, Jack,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301828">'Am I to give him any message?' for he was going up to the barracks for Dick's cabin trunk.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301829">'Tell him I am not crying or anything; that I'm quite quiet and cool,' she answered, and turned to the window again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301830">Oh! why did she want to hear it? What was she listening for? It came presently:</p><q><l>'We twa hae run about the brae,</l><l>And pu'd the gowans fine;</l><l>But we've wandered mony a weary foot,</l><l>Sin' Auld Lang Syne.'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301831">'I feel nothing!' cried Dick's Princess, stretching her cold hands to the wild snow; 'I am past feeling.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301832">But it was not so when Jack returned, on his way to the station.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301833">'Let me go, too,' she pleaded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301834">'No,' he said soothingly; 'poor Dick's awfully cut up; and you'll break down, and make it harder for him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301835">'I am as cool as—as an iceberg,' she cried. 'I must go, Jack.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301836">So he let her go.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301837">They were too late to see him again; the doors of the station were closed. The cabman drove them up close beside a low railing, from whence they could see the long train. They could see three or four officers of other regiments, who had come to say a word of farewell; but she could not see Dick. Once, amid her tears, she saw the waving of a handkerchief, and wondered if it was his. The band struck up again, and the train moved. One by one the instruments ceased—there was an attempt at a cheer, which ended in a huge sob, and the Royal Regiment of Cuirassiers was gone; they had passed away into the distance, and Linda Villiers stood in the dim gray mist of that December dawn, alone. She might have cried:</p><q><l>'My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,</l><l>My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim;</l><l>And I am all aweary of my life.'</l></q></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301838" n="173     BY-AND-BY"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_067" n="14" type="story"><head>BY-AND-BY<lb/>OR, HOW RICHARD CARTER SHOT AT A PIGEON AND BROUGHT DOWN A CROW.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301839">AND by and-by Dick's letters to his Princess grew shorter and more constrained. With each one the girl lost her pluck and her brave on-looking to the future. She was troubled at the change, though she hardly knew in what it consisted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301840">At first Dick's letters had been one passionate outpouring of an imprisoned spirit—imprisoned in that huge gaol known as India. Oh, how he hated India and everything Indian! He should die, he cried out, away from everyone he loved; he had no one to care for him, no one to think of him. He had heard of the splendours of Indian scenery, of the magnificent profuseness of Nature there. Bah! it was hideous, hideous, hideous—a dirty, dusty, dismal, deserted, miserable hole, something like Aldershot, only, compared to India, Aldershot was a perfect paradise. He believed there was fine scenery in Kashmir, but all that Dick had seen on his march to Unapore was hideous, hideous, hideous! That was what India was in Dick's opinion. He didn't know which he hated most—Bombay, the railway carriages, the bungalows, where they put up for the night, the half-barrels, which were provided as baths, and against the unfinished edges of which he had nearly broken his legs twice, or the station at which they ultimately arrived; he hated it all. If he had a preference, it was for Bombay, because it was so many miles nearer to England than Unapore.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301841">For a month or two his detestation of India and everything Indian increased. He wrote to Linda that he had been to a ball at which there were thirteen ladies present, balanced by two hundred and fifty men; the belle was Mrs. Newcombe, a fact which so utterly disgusted him that he went home before the end of the first dance, and gave Indian society up as a failure.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301843">Then he got leave and went to Simla, where the ladies came under his especial censure. 'I don't like the women here at all,' he wrote to his Princess; 'they are vulgar to a degree, they call you by your surname and talk very loudly, they smoke and drink B. and S., and positively guzzle cham-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301842" n="174     CAVALRY LIFE"/>pagne whenever they can get it; as for their morals, they are nil. Here they are during all the hot weather carrying on no end of a life, while their poor devils of husbands are frizzling down in the plains. I cannot do with them after a pet like you '—followed by a good deal of tenderness, which the Princess read and smiled at, and, worst of all, was foolish enough to believe.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301844">And then Dick fell ill; his letters were brimful of that one subject. His leave was almost up, and he should have to go back to Unapore and die—there was not the least doubt about the dying. The men were dying off like sheep; the only times the band was heard was when the 'Dead March' was played; that, the Princess gathered, was about every hour or so. Three officers had died within a few hours of one another—to be sure, one was in consequence of a fall from his horse, and another had steadily killed himself by drinking—she had seen that in the papers—the Colonel had had a very bad go of fever, Creyke was very ill, and Dickson, so Dick had heard, was a perfect wreck. Poor Dick! in one week more his leave would be over, and he must make up his mind to go back to Unapore and die.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301845">Ah! how she wept over that letter with a wild sense of rebellion against the ill-fortune which had made her anything but a great heiress, who could have given her soldier-hero all he wished in a country more suited to his tastes than India had proved to be! Poor Princess! Alas! she had a passionate adoration and fair prospects, but passionate adoration is, unfortunately, not good to eat, neither will it provide shelter and raiment; and as for prospects, she knew, as most people do—or, if they don't, they will very soon find out-that it is but ill work waiting for dead men's shoes. And so she could only weep over Dick's letters, and gather such papers as might interest him, or make her eyes ache by writing long letters, telling him over and over again how she was always thinking of him all the day—ay, and, for the matter of that, half the night too.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301847">By the next mail came a still more disastrous letter. His health was worse—so ill, indeed, was he that a medical board was to sit on him at his rooms with a view to further leave. At the end of that epistle was a postscript to the effect that the board had obtained for him four months' sick-leave. Once more her spirits rose, she breathed freely, she went about the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301846" n="175     BY-AND-BY"/>house singing like a lark, so glad of heart was she that her boy had been successful. She carried the letter about with her, she read and re-read it, she talked to the photograph she wore in her locket, and she wrote Dick the longest letter she had ever written to him, or to anyone else, during her whole life. She took his helmet out of the case and cleaned it carefully, until it shone like burnished gold. Never had Dick's soldier servant bestowed such tender attention upon it. She put it on her own head, and, looking in the glass, tried to cheat herself into the belief that they were not dark eyes which she beheld beneath it, but the true blue orbs which she had seen there aforetime—that the heavy knot of brown hair which tilted it up behind was not there in reality, but only the back of Dick's close-cropped head. It was of no use: the face under the helmet was that of the Princess, and Dick's was thousands of miles away amid the lovely scenery of Simla; yes, he had retracted his first opinion somewhat, and admitted that Simla was lovely. She fell then to wondering what he was doing. Thinking of her, of course—thinking of his Princess, and calculating how soon he could save sufficient money to take him back to England and her. Oh, Princess, Princess! why did you go about all that brilliant September day with the selfsame song upon your lips, which Dick had cursed so heartily on Christmas Eve?—</p><q>'In the gloaming, oh, my darling! think not bitterly of me,</q><q>Though I passed away in silence, left you lonely, set you free;</q><q>For my heart was crushed with longing, what had been could never be:</q><q>It was best to leave you thus, dear, best for you and best for me.'</q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301849">Why did your heart's gladness find its vent in words like those? Could it be that they were a foreshadowing of what was to come, the first of the by-and-by? Presently a letter came, not less profuse in terms of endearment than the former ones had been, and yet the scalding tears rushed into the girl's eyes as she read it, a blank pain settled down upon her heart, never to be quite lifted any more; she could not have told what manner of pain it was, nor why it had come, therefore I use the word 'blank' advisedly. The letter was loving, but it was evidently written in great haste; it ended, 'God speed my darling,' and yet, in his carelessness, he had blotted the words. He wanted this, he wanted that; Princess was to do this, to get that. Why should it pain her so sorely? She could not <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301848" n="176     CAVALRY LIFE"/>tell; it was the undefinable <hi rend="italic">something</hi> which had begun the <hi rend="italic">by- and-by</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301850">Amongst other news which this letter contained was that there was to be a fancy ball to which Dick was going in the character of the Earl of Leicester, 'of the time of Queen Elizabeth, you know,' he added. Ah! surely that was the unkindest sting of all—'the time of Queen Elizabeth. 'What had come to Dick that he took it for granted that she did not know to what period of history <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Earl of Leicester belonged? And so the pain settled down upon her heart and stayed there.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301851">The bright September days crept over, and chill October came in, but there were no letters from Dick. The girl fretted and worried and pined to know what could have chanced. Surely he must be ill that he did not write. She got the helmet out and cleaned it again, she looked up his old letters and read them a dozen times over—all of them, save the last one; there was but one line of that she cared to remember: that was the 'God speed my darling' at the end.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301852">The days crept on. Twenty of October's thirty-one suns had come and gone, the Indian mails were in, but there was no letter from Dick. All that day the Princess stayed in the house, lest the precious missive might come, and, coming, lie one moment unread; but no, it came not.</p><q><l>'It came not, no, it came not,</l><l>The night came on alone;</l><l>The little stars sat, one by one,</l><l>Each on its golden throne.'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301853">So the Princess went to her bed and slept, for a wonder, long and heavily, and towards morning she had a dream. She dreamed that at last the longed-for letter had arrived, and that it was but a letter of farewell, conveying the announcement of his approaching marriage. She awoke with a gasp of relief that it was, after all, <hi rend="italic">only</hi> a dream. How could an idea so idiotic have got into her brain? she wondered. Dick marry! The idea was too absurd. What! to one of the women who 'are vulgar to a degree, who call men by their surnames and talk very loudly, whose morals are nil, who drink B. and S., and positively guzzle champagne, whenever they can get it'? How supremely absurd to think of Dick marrying one of those!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301855">And yet the impression produced by the dream could not <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301854" n="177     BY-AND-BY"/> be shaken off, it was so distinct; she had seen the letter so plainly—the bluish foreign paper stamped with the crest of the regiment, Dick's careless yet firm writing—it had been all too real. There was only one thing unlike Dick—its utter coldness. Whatever his failings had been—and, dearly as she loved him, she had not been blind to them—no! though she had loved his very faults because they were his, coldness had not been one of them. She tried to argue herself into the belief that, since dreams always go by the rule of contrary, Dick's next letter would bring her good news—perhaps! Ah! the thought which flashed across her mind made her very heart stand still for a moment; perhaps he had somehow contrived to get leave and was coming home. And so, amid hopes and fears, the next few days slipped over, and at last the letter appeared.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301856">'It's a very thin one,' murmured the Princess ruefully, as she opened it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301857">The first thing that caught her eye was the end. No 'God speed my darling,' not even the more usual termination, ' Your own Dick '—no, nothing of his usual tenderness. It was a new sensation which thrilled through her heart as her eyes fell upon the four words which concluded the letter, for they were 'Yours truly, Richard Carter.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301858">The by-and-by had come.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301859">It is not necessary to give the letter in detail. It was incoherent—<hi rend="italic">very</hi>. The handwriting was shaky, the tone half tender, half bland! The latter was, indeed, one of the expressions he used. 'You don't know how it pains me to tell you thus blandly——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301860">'Blandly,' repeated the Princess with a passionate sob;' fancy Dick bland—to me!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301861">And what was it that he told her thus blandly?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301862">It was merely the fulfilment of the dream which she had not been able to banish from her mind. Dick had—well, not exactly forgotten her, but he had made up his mind that the only way out of his difficulties was by a rich marriage, and so he was going to be married.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301864">The lady—he called her a <hi rend="italic">lady</hi>, so the Princess concluded that she was not a girl—was called McPhearson. She was rich! she was handsome! she was loving! She was going to pay off all his debts—or, at least, her father was going to do so, which amounted to the same thing. Her people lived in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301863" n="178     CAVALRY LIFE"/>London, and she was staying in India for a little while with a married sister. Dick was quite sure if the Princess knew her she would like her awfully. Linda was not so sure of it—she was rather doubtful on the subject, but that was nothing; and that was all, excepting 'Yours truly, Richard Carter,' over which the Princess wept most bitterly of all. And then, when her first grief had passed somewhat, she began to put two and two together, to think the matter over. She was not exactly a fool, and she knew life pretty well—indeed, considering her short experience of two-and-twenty years, better than most people.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301865">The lady was Scotch; there could be no doubt of that. Her father lived in London—then, what was she doing out in India? She must have gone out on 'spec,' husband-hunting. The Princess wondered was she oldish. Probably she was older than Dick, or he would never, surely, have spoken of her as 'this lady.' And Dick owed some four or five thousand pounds, which Mr. McPhearson was going to pay! To the Princess's tolerably keen mind that hadn't a Scotch sound about it. If Dick had been a nobleman, she could understand some rich City man 'shelling out,' but for a simple 'sub' in a cavalry regiment-why, it was absurd! it hadn't a Scotch sound about it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301866">The result of her calculations was that she wrote and recommended Dick to get his debts paid before he was married.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301867">'Ladies,' she wrote, 'who are young, rich, and handsome have no need to go out to India husband-hunting, unless there is something very, very shady in the background. If she has gone all the way to India to catch a husband, I don't believe her father will be willing to pay four or five thousand pounds for him; it hasn't a Scotch sound about it, Dick.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301868">But Dick did not wait to receive her advice. His anxiety to secure his pigeon was too great, and it was not many weeks after she had received the news of his intended matrimonial venture that she saw an announcement in the Times:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301869">'On the 7th ult., at Simla, by the Rev.——, Richard Carter, Esquire (the Cuirassiers), of Breakdown Castle, County Cork, to Lily, youngest daughter of Andrew McPhearson, Esquire, of 17, Tollington Crescent, W.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301871">And so it was all over; the bullet, which was, in piercing Dick Carter's heart, to make him forget his Princess, had <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301870" n="179     BY-AND-BY"/>found a billet—perhaps neither of them had looked forward to its being a bullet of gold. Well, the end had come; Linda Villiers might sit down and weep her very heart out, or laugh and forget him. Dick wouldn't care which—at least, that was what she told herself, and she had a fair knowledge of life, considering her years.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301872">During the week which followed she got very tired of seeing that same announcement-in every paper in which the notice of a marriage could be put was it found: <hi rend="italic">Times, Telegraph, Standard, Daily News, Illustrated London News, the Graphic—</hi> nay, when one day turning over some numbers of the Queen, she came upon the following, over which she laughed out aloud; and, be it known, she had of late done very little in the way of laughter. It came under the heading of 'The Upper Ten Thousand at Home and Abroad':</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301873">'A marriage has been arranged between Mr. Richard Carter, Cuirassiers, of Breakdown Castle, County Cork, and the youngest daughter of Mr. Andrew McPhearson, of 17, Tollington Crescent, Kensington, W.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301874">Poor, forsaken Princess! She laughed till she cried, and she cried till her head ached, and then she went to bed and sobbed herself to sleep; but she cut the announcement out and put it away with that of the marriage.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301875">'The Upper Ten Thousand'—no, I won't be quite sure that it was not under 'Marriages in High Life,' but any lady reader will know; it makes no matter, for both were equally absurd. The Princess was certainly anxious to know which of the two families had inserted the numerous announcements of the marriage. One of them must be very proud of the alliance; of that there could be no doubt. She rather fancied it was on the McPhearson side, for she had an idea that the Carters had not a great deal of money to spare—at least, Dick had always said so.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301877">And that was the end of it all. Dick Carter had found himself a bride in India, and the girl whom he had called his Princess had to get over the change as best she could—she did get over it in time. The old obstinate spirit, which had fought so bravely in the Crusades under Cœur de Lion, lived in the girl still; the cool, determined, brave heart with which her grandsire fought through the Peninsular—for the Villiers had all been gallant soldiers for generations—which carried <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301876" n="180     CAVALRY LIFE"/>him into Egypt (one of Abercrombie's chosen start), and to Waterloo with Picton—it lived again in the girl. She was heart-broken, ill, weary of her life; she had lost what she valued most upon earth, but she struggled on—on to the time when the fair prospects had become substantial realities; to the time when she could look back to the old days and see only the brightness; when she could admit that, as they were, things were best; when, thinking of Dick tenderly still, she could bear to listen to the strains of that old Scotch melody, which had wrung her heart so sorely as they floated to her, through the driving snow, that chill December morning, when she and Dick had said 'good-bye,' to meet on this side of the grave never more—though then they had both looked forward to the by-and-by.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301878">But that was not quite the end. Not many months after Dick Carter entered the bonds of holy matrimony a series of announcements appeared in the papers which made the Princess—I call her by the familiar name still—come to the conclusion that it was from the McPhearson side that the numerous notices of the marriage had emanated—not that this one was in connection with a wedding: quite the contrary; it ran thus:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301879">'On the 25th, at 17, Tollington Crescent, Kensington, W., Andrew McPhearson, Esq., aged 80 years. Dearly loved and deeply regretted. Indian papers please copy.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301880">'How strange,' remarked the Princess, ' to say, "Indian papers please copy," when he has two daughters married in India!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301881">Yes; it was perhaps a little strange, and something else rather astonished her—his age. Eighty years! She came to the conclusion that—and all her information was by that means—Mrs. Richard Carter was in all probability a good deal older than her husband, who was seven-and-twenty. To be sure, Mr. McPhearson <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have married late in life, and 'Lily ' <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be the youngest of a very large family; but, still, the chances were ten to one against it. Of that, however, she had no means of knowing, except she had troubled herself to write to some of her friends in India, which she did not do. No; she saw the notices of the old man's death in the papers with a sigh and a certain feeling of sadness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301883">Dick had soon come into his kingdom! No doubt he had <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301882" n="181     BY-AND-BY"/>quite forgotten her by this time, she thought—quite ceased to regret her, that is. That he could forget her was, of course, utterly impossible; as long as he lived, he could never remember leaving for India without a thought of the girl who had risen at four o'clock in the morning and bidden him adieu to the strains of 'Auld Lang Syne!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301884">And time crept on. It was some months after the death of old Mr. McPhearson that the Princess was in London with her mother on their way to the sunny Rhineland. They stayed in the great city to see the Academy and one or two theatres, at one of which they witnessed that old-world comedy, 'She Stoops to Conquer.' The play began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301885">'I wish people would come earlier', remarked the Princess plaintively, as she rose, for about the twentieth time, to allow some people to pass.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301886">'The places on this row are all filled now,' returned the mother consolingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301887">At the last-comers she scarcely glanced, except to notice that one was a tall lady in a gray opera cloak, the other a young man, apparently her son.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301888">The play went on, and to it the Princess gave her undivided attention until it was ended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301889">'Splendid play!' she observed, when it was over.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301890">It was to be succeeded by a farce, and during the interval the audience behaved as an audience at a theatre generally does behave. The men got up and moved about, speaking to their acquaintances; the usual trays of ices and wine were sent round; women criticised other women's dresses; there was general bustle and hum of voices. Suddenly the Princess became aware that a gentleman had come behind her, and was speaking to the lady in the gray opera cloak.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301891">'Oh, we are in Tollington Crescent,' she said, evidently in answer to some question.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301892">Tollington Crescent! She pricked up her ears immediately; it was a magic sound to her. She turned her head, and saw that the lady was in mourning; then she turned it away again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301893">'Oh, my mother's gone down to Exmouth,' she said—again the Princess had missed the question—'my brother's got a little son. She has gone down to see her grandson.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301894">'But your brother has been married some time,' said the gentleman; 'this is not the first?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301895">'Oh no; but the first boy -the son and heir.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301896" n="182     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301897">The last words were, however, spoken in a tone which plainly showed that the addition, 'and heir,' was intended as a joke, and meant to be received as such.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301898">'Ah, the first that counts, I suppose?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301899">'Er—yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301900">A moment's silence; then the lady spoke again:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301901">'I have not seen you for some time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301902">'No; I have been out of town for six weeks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301903">Really. I thought that perhaps you had already gone to India.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301904">'Oh no.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301905">'When do you go?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301906">'In about six weeks. And have you heard from Laura and Lily lately?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301907">'Oh yes; they are both very well.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301908">'Still at Simla?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301909">'Oh yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301910">If the Princess had been a fainting sort of young lady she would probably have fainted; but as she was not, she did nothing of the kind. She turned rather pale, and a deadly sickness crept over her: but she preserved sufficient presence of mind to carefully examine the appearance of the lady from Tollington Crescent. Now, up to that moment she had never for one instant doubted the reality of the riches in the McPhearson family; but after five minutes' survey of her neighbour's dress they took unto themselves wings and fled away—as the reader may have known reputed riches do before today.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301912">Mrs. Richard Carter's sister—for of course she was a sister—had taken off, or rather thrown back, her cloak, after a fashion ladies have when a theatre becomes too warm. The Princess was glad of it, for it gave her a more favourable opportunity of studying her person. She was a tall woman, perhaps six or seven and forty—she might be a little less, but that was what she looked. She had—the Princess began with the crown of her head, and worked slowly downwards—she had SCOTCH stamped on her! Her hair was of that peculiar hue just now so fashionable, and known as 'cardinal red'; not ordinary red hair, but a deep scarlet. By way of a headdress, she had a bit of rusty black feather, what, I am told, is best described as feather trimming, and which, as the Princess told herself scornfully, she wouldn't have picked up in the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301911" n="183     BY-AND-BY"/>street, much less have worn it about her person. Her face was long, with an undeniably good nose, high cheek-bones, a hard mouth, and lack-lustre eyes of the description known as 'boiled gooseberries'; it was a face without any softness in it, which might, perhaps, have been accounted for by the brick-dust colour of the complexion and the scarcity of eyebrows and lashes—it might be that the Princess was a little prejudiced.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301913">But to continue: Mrs. Richard Carter's sister wore a gown of some thin black material—'not worth ten shillings, 'the Princess said afterwards. The bodice was cut square—it was cut very square; so square that, had the wearer been a lady of Venus-like proportions, it might have been thought by a fastidious person to be cut too square. As it was, the Princess's eyes beheld a broad expanse of fleshless bony chest, which absolutely made her shiver. 'It was like a dead woman's neck,' she said afterwards.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301914">The sleeves of this gown did not come down to the wrist, but ended at the elbow; probably they were what ladies describe as elbow sleeves; at all events, a pair of very sharp angles protruded under the frilling which fastened them off. On her arms she wore black mittens of open-work. Now, I take it that, possessed of a pair of beautiful hands and arms, a lady cannot do better than pretend to cover them with open-work mittens. Mrs. Richard Carter's sister had got the mittens, but, alas! she had neither the beautiful arms nor hands. The wrists were long and large, the hands had no breed about them; the nails were square and they were not very clean; moreover, they had those white blemishes upon them which are commonly known as 'gifts ':</p><q>'A gift on the thumb is sure to come;</q><q>A gift on the finger is sure to linger.'</q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301916">If there be any truth in old sayings, Mrs. Richard Carter's sister had a great many presents in store. Not only had the nails 'gifts' on them, but the surrounding skin had grown over them so as to almost hide the half-moons which most people admire. Not only were the nails objectionable, but the fingers also, for they turned up with a thick lump of flesh beyond the nail, and gave them the appearance of being bitten. She wore a considerable quantity of rings, but there was not—the Princess especially noticed that—a diamond amongst them, or, indeed, one of any value. She thought of the filbert nails and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301915" n="184     CAVALRY LIFE"/>the four or five valuable rings hidden away beneath her own gloves.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301917">On one arm—no bailiff's man ever took more careful account of the knick-knacks of a house than the Princess did of this lady's personal adornments—on one arm she wore a fourpenny black snake bangle, on the other a heavy bracelet of gold! She took especial notice of that bracele—-it was a huge onyx, as large as a walnut, and set in 'a broad band of gold.' She knew, as most people do who have given their attention to such things, that the onyx, like the amethyst, is not a very valuable stone, and when set in gold of good quality diamonds and pearls are used also—there were neither diamonds nor pearls in the bracelet, so the Princess came to the natural conclusion that the massive gold setting hailed-perhaps from Abyssinia.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301918">'I don't believe,' she said afterwards, 'that there is any money at all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301919">'Cannot be much,' answered the mother.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301920">So the Princess went back to her hotel, and thought it all over. What a strange coincidence, that she should be thus brought in contact with the sister of the woman who had succeeded in marrying Dick, and still more strange that by her conversation she should have known who she was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301921">The result of her cogitations was that on the following morning she suggested that they should take a hansom as far as Somerset House and just have a look at the old gentleman's will.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301922">Her suggestion was soon carried into effect. They drove through the grand quadrangle, and were set down at the will department. On entering, they were informed that they must purchase a shilling stamp, and then she was given a big book, and told to look out the name. She had but small difficulty in finding it:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301923">'Andrew McPhearson, 17,Tollington Crescent, Kensington, W.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301924">There it stood.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301925">Then they were directed to the reading-room, and told that the will should be sent in a few minutes. They found the room, in which were a few chairs, a bench or two, a long table, and two grave-looking clerks, watching to see that the documents were not tampered with.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301926">And presently <hi rend="italic">the</hi> will appeared.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301927" n="185     BY-AND-BY"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301928">'You must read it at the table,' said one of the grave clerks, as the Princess stretched out her hand to take it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301929">'Oh, must I? I did not know,' she said apologetically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301930">'<hi rend="italic">Under</hi> twenty thousand pounds,' she said, with a little gasp, to her mother.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301931">There was the usual legal preamble as to the soundness of the testator's mind, then everything—'all my houses, lands, furniture, books, pictures, carriages, horses, domestic animals, and things'—was left to the wife for life, with the exception of the sum of one thousand pounds, to be paid at once to the trustees of his grand-daughter, Mary Bagot, the interest of which was to be applied for her schooling and maintenance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301932">'I don't like that word "schooling,"'said the mother critically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301933">'It has rather a third-rate ring about it,' replied the Princess, continuing her perusal of the will.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301934">At his wife's death or marriage the testator directed that to each of his daughters, Marion Bagot, Janet Neville, and Laura Ashburnham, he gave the sum of two thousand pounds, to be invested for them—though only with their written consent—by the trustees named in the will, the interest to be paid to them, or only upon their written receipt. In the case of either of them dying without children, their money was to return to such brothers and sisters as might be living or have left children. To Lily, if, at the time of her mother's marriage or death, she should be unmarried, he gave <hi rend="italic">three</hi> thousand pounds; but if she should be married, she was only to receive two thousand, as her sisters—in either case, less one hundred pounds 'had in anticipation.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301935">'Bless me!' the Princess ejaculated blankly, 'whatever can that mean?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301936">'To take her out to India, of course,' returned the mother; 'and little enough, too.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301937">'It wouldn't buy her outfit,' gasped the girl.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301938">But to continue:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301939">To his son Donald the testator bequeathed the sum of one thousand pounds, unrestricted (at his mother's death, that is to say). To his son McIvor the sum of one thousand pounds, less three hundred 'had in anticipation. 'The remainder of the money to be equally divided amongst his six children.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301940" n="186     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301941">'And that is all,' said the Princess. 'But look, it says "late of Calcutta"; I wonder what he has been?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301942">'He has evidently made his money himself, and he does not intend some idle, extravagant fellows to marry his daughters and spend it,' Mrs. Villiers replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301943">The Princess turned the document over thoughtfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301944">'I wonder which is the codicil?' she said aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301945">'There is not one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301946">'But it says the "Will and Codicil."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301947">'I think,' put in one of the grave personages at the end of the table, 'that it is merely a clerical error; but I will inquire.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301948">It was merely 'a clerical error.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301949">Princess thanked him, and said 'good-morning.' She did not speak until they had got half-way across the quadrangle.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301950">'Then, when her mother dies—which may be twenty years hence—she will have, at the outside, about a hundred and forty pounds a years strictly tied up to herself—Dick being able to touch neither principal nor interest—and if she dies without children it goes back to her family. Of course, she <hi rend="italic">may</hi> have money of her own; but no—if that were so, he would not have provided the other thousand. No, a hundred and forty pounds a year! I wonder if he is very fond of her? He didn't use to like red-haired women. If not—why, I should have been the better match by far—but, then, to be sure, I had no money then.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301951">The Princess's money had come, as many things do come in this world, too late. Oh, the pity of it! Oh, the pity of it!</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_070" n="15" type="story"><head>SUPERSEDED.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_071" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301953">SHE was always called 'Pretty Polly.' When she first came from school (that grand London school, where the terms were a hundred a year <hi rend="italic">with</hi> extras), her mother made an effort—not a small one, for when Mrs. Hugh Antrobus made an effort it was usually one which might be classified as prodigious—to have her called by her proper name of Mary. Perhaps that was one of the very few instances on record in which an effort of Mrs. Hugh's had proved a failure; but a failure it undoubtedly was, and a very signal one, too. No one could or would remember <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301952" n="187     SUPERSEDED"/>to call her anything but 'Polly'; and so at last Mrs. Hugh gave it up, and even fell back herself into the old familiar habit of calling her eldest daughter 'Polly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301954">Polly's father was a lawyer; not a particularly distinguished one—indeed, there were people in Blankhampton ill-natured enough to say what money he had he had not come by in too honest a fashion; but that is rather beside the question. Certain it is that Mr. Antrobus was a lawyer, and hardly at the top of the tree; he had married a lady whose father was in the cotton-spinning way, without much money, but with remarkably large ideas. One of Mrs. Hugh's ideas was that Polly was the most utterly beautiful young woman who had ever been born—many mothers think the same; another, that Polly was destined to make a brilliant matrimonial alliance—Mrs. Hugh never said anything so commonplace as 'marriage.' Having made up her mind on these two important points, Mrs. Hugh felt that Polly would have small opportunity of encompassing that desirable end so long as they remained in the house at forty pounds rent, which they had occupied since their marriage; so she cast about in the neighbourhood of Blankhampton, and finally decided upon the River House as a suitable abode.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301955">Now, the River House was quite the best in the vicinity, and was, in fact, a mansion in miniature.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301956">'It will suit us exactly, Hugh,' she said, when they had finally arranged with the landlord, and were inspecting it with a view to re-decoration; 'a charming hall; and these glass doors will keep the vestibule and upper gallery as warm as possible. And the library—I should think we should have enough books to fill up the shelves, Hugh. As for the dining-room, it is a superb apartment; we shall require nothing but a carpet—and really, Hugh, I think we might afford a Turkey. The drawing-room: ah, the girls must look after this! Mary'—she was as yet in the Mary period—' Mary will be able to exercise her ingenuity. Back-stairs <hi rend="italic">and</hi> servants' hall: well, Hugh, when we can afford a billiard-table this will be the very place to put it in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301958">She had probably forgotten that in a billard-room a sidelight is objectionable; perhaps she had never known it: but that is not à <hi rend="italic">propos</hi> of the subject. Upon one point she was right—inside and out the River House was all that could be desired. It stood in the midst of tastefully laid-out grounds, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301957" n="188     CAVALRY LIFE"/>sloping in terraces down to the river's bank, or, rather, to the public promenade which led to the city, half a mile away. Not quite so far off, in the opposite direction, were the Cavalry Barracks, from whence Mrs. Hugh—though she did not say so—thought it not improbable Polly's splendid match might come.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301959">In due time the Antrobus family removed to the River House, and Polly began to feel she had taken her proper position in the world. Now that her home was a mansion in miniature, with a servants' hall, a housekeeper's room, a courtyard, and stabling for twelve horses, she felt she could invite, or, at least, feel equal to inviting, any of the City heiresses or noblemen's daughters with whom she had associated at Miss Neville's. True, there was only one nobleman's daughter in that establishment: her father was an Irish earl, and not even a representative peer; her dresses were always shabby, and her bills were a long time unpaid. And equally true was it that the Antrobuses could have done without a servants'-hall; and had not a housekeeper to occupy the room set apart for her; nor yet horses to fill the stables. Still, the stables, and the housekeeper's room, and the servants' hall were indisputable facts, just as it was that she had been at school with an earl's daughter, and Polly felt that the several circumstances added to her dignity not a little.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301960">And so Mrs. Hugh received her friends in the big drawing-room with bland complacency, and Polly swept her trains along the polished floors of the vestibule and passages as if she had been accustomed to parquetry all her life; while the younger girls, To-To and Baby, narrowly escaped breaking their necks by daring rambles on the roof itself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301962">It was April when they entered upon their new domain; soft balmy weather, so that Polly was able to parade about the garden paths of an evening, with a scarlet shawl twisted about her shoulders, and a natty little sailor hat, with a ribbon of the same colour, perched on the elaborate coiffure of twists and coils in which her fair hair was arranged. She certainly was very pretty; everyone acknowledged it. She was tall, being rather above the middle height, but, when you had said so much, that was about all that could be said for her figure—it was not actually a bad figure, but, most assuredly, it was not a good one; she had pretty hands, with long slender fingers, and her face was as fair as a blush-rose; her forehead was low and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301961" n="189     SUPERSEDED"/>white, and her flaxen hair fell on either side in the rippling waves you may have seen in a Greek statue; her nose was slightly inclined to be aquiline, and her mouth, it must be owned, was the least prepossessing feature in her face—it was undeniably a foolish mouth, weak and without character, yet the lips were red as cherries and, when parted, displayed a row of even, pearly teeth, so beautiful in themselves that few persons noticed the weakness of the mouth. Her eyes were blue, not particularly large or expressive, but of a lovely turquoise tint, and her complexion was glorious—there was not the least flaw in it, it was perfect: of the delicate whiteness of Parian marble, with an apple-blossom flush upon it—it was a complexion which would have made a plain face charming. Now, Polly was most emphatically not plain!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301963">She was a nice girl, too—good-natured and gentle, and, though somewhat given to romancing and very much given to dreaming, had no bad habits. She played very nicely Thalberg's 'Home, Sweet Home!' and other pieces of that calibre; she kept the flower-vases in the drawing-room carefully arranged, and she spent a good deal of her time in the garden—' the grounds' the Antrobus family called them—sitting in a careless yet graceful attitude on some rustic bench, with a book in her hand, of which she read but little. Polly never did a stitch of sewing, but was for the most part dreaming of that grand future which was coming, and trying how near she could model her person and her manners upon those of a young duchess.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301964">'A young duchess' was Polly's favourite ideal, though she had never seen one herself, and Lady Edith O'Shaughnassy's description of the young Duchess of Ballycorum was not at all the same class of person as Polly's Duchess of Dreamland.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301965">'Just a slip of a girl, with a wide mouth and two great staring black eyes,' Lady Edith had said, 'and dressed nine days out of ten in a gown of rough homespun and a thick gray jacket, with no end of pockets, and her boots—just regular brogues.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301966">'And for church?' Polly had asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301967">'Oh, not much better. A brown velveteen dress, with a jacket like it, and a brown felt hat, with a scarlet wing in it—sometimes a sealskin jacket, but not often; for Ballycorum is three miles from the church, and the Duke's a big man, so she's warm enough walking.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301968" n="190     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301969">'And does a duchess walk three miles to church?' Polly gasped, all her most cherished ideas thus being turned topsyturvy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301970">'Of course—no one has his horses out on Sunday in our part,' Lady Edith answered promptly; 'but when old Lady Ballycorum is at the Castle she uses the pony-carriage.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301971">It was very evident that her Grace of Ballycorum did not belong to the same order as the Duchess of Dreamland—perhaps it was because she was an Irish duchess! Polly's 'Grace' lived in an atmosphere always heavy with perfumery, surrounded always by masses of hot-house flowers and rare exotics. Upon every occasion she made a <hi rend="italic">toilette</hi>, and even her <hi rend="italic">négligées</hi> were of the richest silk and velvet, profusely decked with <hi rend="italic">priceless</hi> old lace; with her, diamonds were so much a matter of course that even her bedroom slippers were adorned with buckles glittering with those costly gems—only the Duchess of Dreamland had nothing so common as a bedroom, she had a sleeping apartment; she summoned her footman by means of a silver bell, and when she felt 'a little low'—which she did sometimes, in an exceedingly refined manner—drank rare wine out of a fragile goblet of Venetian glass; she was quite too luxurious to walk a step, and apparently did not stand in need of exercise like less privileged mortals.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301972">As for the Duke, he was but a lay figure. Once Polly had exerted herself sufficiently to begin a novel, with herself in the character of a duchess for heroine; but she came to one sentence so thrilling that she straightway fell a-dreaming, and the novel was never finished:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301973">'May laid her hand on the embroidered sleeve of the Duke'—after that it was impossible to go on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301975">Well, the glorious summer months passed over, and the family at the River House seemed no nearer to attaining their object. Their intimacy with the barracks did not altogether progress—Mr. Antrobus called on the mess and received a few days later a couple of cards, left by two gentlemen, who did not even ask if he was at home. Mrs. Hugh called on all the officers' wives—for the Cuirassiers had been ordered to Blankhampton a month after the Antrobuses went to the River House—but the calls had been returned and their invitations declined: the Cuirassiers would not have them at any price. However, they did manage to scrape a tolerable intimacy with the Paymaster, whose back-windows overlooked the River <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301974" n="191     SUPERSEDED"/>House gardens; and when, in due time, the invitations for the officers' ball were issued, through Captain Lewis's interest one vent to the River House.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301976">Polly was almost roused out of her habitual serenity. As for Mrs. Hugh, she folded her fat arms and beamed about the house with benignant triumph.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301977">'You must have a new dress, Polly!' she cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301978">'Oh yes,' Polly returned—that was a matter of course.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301979">'Have you thought of anything nice?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301980">'Yes,' answered Polly, after a moment's pause; 'I will have azure and silver.'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_072" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><epigraph><q>'There was a sound of revelry by night.'</q></epigraph><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301981">So there was: the Blankhampton Assembly Rooms were brilliantly lighted and superbly decorated. At the entrance stood two sergeants, each bearing a silver salver, one to receive the cards of invitation, one to dispense the programmes. Between them and the outer entrance stood a guard of honour, and within the room itself was stationed the regimental sergeant major, ready to bawl forth the name of each fresh arrival.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301982">On the right of the doorway, some yards within the room, stood Colonel Cotherstone, and opposite to him his officers <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>—only they were not exactly <hi rend="italic">en masse</hi>, for they stood in a straight row, for the most part with their hands behind them, looking for all the world like a class of very gorgeous schoolboys just about to say their lessons. And so, after all, they were. My simile is not far wrong, for were they not one and all about to repeat the lesson which officers seem to be so proficient in learning, and which they are all so willing to teach to others?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301983">'I wonder', muttered Anthony Creyke to his next neighbour, Eliot Cardella, 'if old Dare expects I shall dance with his daughters, because if he does——' He broke off suddenly, for into the Honourable Eliot's gray eyes had come a gleam of surprise, and he exclaimed, 'Gad! what a pretty girl!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301984">It was Polly—and Eliot Cardella was the Earl of Mallinbro's second son.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301985">Major Creyke looked after Polly, and remarked, 'Pretty Well.' He did not admire pink-and-white Dresden-china sort of girls.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1301986" n="192     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301987">Eliot Cardella dropped out of the line at once and marched off to where Mrs. and Miss Antrobus were standing with Captain and Mrs. Lewis.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301988">'Good-evening, Mrs. Lewis. May I ask for the first?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301989">Under any other circumstances Mr. Cardella would have seen Mrs. Lewis on the top of the guard-room clock before he would have asked her to dance, but to all general rules there are exceptions; Polly made one that night.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301990">'I believe the second is a gallop?' he said to Polly, with that deferential air of courtesy which implies so much and really means so little.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301991">'I believe it is,' returned Polly, glancing at her card.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301992">'I'm afraid I don't dance very well, excepting a polka,' he began; 'but if you will do me the honour——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301993">'I shall be pleased,' said Polly serenely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301994">'May I take a polka also?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301995">'Oh yes,' Polly answered; she would have danced an Irish jig with
Lord Mallinbro's son.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301996">And so the ball began. Cardella walked through the mazes of a quadrille with Mrs. Lewis, and Mrs. Antrobus sat blandly watching her daughter do the same with Captain Lewis. She thought she had never seen Polly looking so well. Her dress of sheeny, shimmering blue silken stuff was wreathed with frosted silver gauze, and studded here and there with large frosted water-lilies; round her white throat she wore a string of pearls, and half hidden in her flaxen hair were half-opened waterlily-buds.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301997">'Who's Cardella talking to?' one Cuirassier asked of another. 'Very pretty girl.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301998">'Ya-as,' returned the other, with the instinctive hauteur a soldier invariably puts on when speaking of someone a shade beneath him. 'Fathaw's a lawyer fellah—always hanging about the barracks. Keep clear of attorneys myself; one never can be sure they haven't a writ or two in their pockets—combining business and pleasaw at the same time, you know. Cardella seems taken.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1301999">'Young fool!' said the first speaker emphatically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302000">Meantime the band had struck up, and our couple started; but after two turns Eliot Cardella abruptly stopped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302001">'I must apologize for bringing you into this mess,' he said, in a tone of concern.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302003">'It is of no consequence', said Polly sweetly, regardless of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302002" n="193     SUPERSEDED"/>the strip of torn silk floating behind her, and the big frosted water-lily tossed to and fro amongst the dancers like a cork on a stormy sea. She was unaware that her substantial foot had come down like a half-brick on that of her partner, and he gallantly kept the knowledge to himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302004">'I won't put you into further risk,' he said politely. 'Shall I find you another partner, or will you forgive me, and sit this dance out?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302005">'I do not think there is anything to forgive,' said Polly, in a soft, murmuring voice, and raising her turquoise-blue eyes artlessly to his. 'I would just as soon sit out with you as dance with anyone else;' but there was the faintest emphasis on the word <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, as if she preferred sitting out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302006">'You are too flattering,' returned the incorrigible flirt, sinking his voice to the level of hers, and bending his eyes tenderly on her face. 'Shall we find a seat here?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302007">'Here' was a small lounge, almost hidden behind a folding-door and a screen of flowers, and just the very place Polly felt was best for a <hi rend="italic">tête-à-tête</hi> with an earl's son. She sank down in a languid attitude, her azure and silver draperies falling in graceful folds about her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302008">`I am so sorry,' said Cardella, when he had squeezed himself into the small space left for him, 'to have spoilt your beautiful dress. What a bore you must think me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302009">`I do not think it was you who did it,' Polly answered innocently; 'I believe it was Colonel Cotherstone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302010">'Very likely.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302011">In his heart he did not in the least care who had done it, and thought the Colonel much more likely to be the delinquent than himself. When a man gets to the chiefs age he ought to give up capering in a ballroom.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302012">`I say, Cardella,' said Dickson, ten minutes later, 'look out what you're after; that girl's father is a lawyer-not of too high repute, either. I don't deny that she's awfully pretty—only be careful.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302013">'Oh, she's awfully pretty!' Cardella said readily; 'but have you seen her feet? By George! they are heavy! The Major's mare, Bonny Bell, trod on my foot last week, and it was nothing to hers'—glancing in Polly's direction.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302014">'Same foot?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302015">'Yes, worse luck.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302016">'Poor devil!' laughed Dickson.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302017" n="194     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302018">Who, having overheard the above conversation, would have expected
to see Mr. Eliot Cardella make his way to Polly's side as soon as she
was free? And yet that was what he did. Probably the mere fact that
there was a sharp father in the background only made him more ready
for the fun of flirting with her. Everyone knows that an Englishman
enjoys sport the better when it has an element of danger in it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302019">'Mr. Cardella,' said Polly, in her soft voice, 'who is that
strange-looking officer over there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302020">'The elderly man?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302021">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302022">'Oh, that's our Surgeon-Major--"Chronohotontologos" we call
him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302023">Polly opened her blue eyes very wide indeed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302024">'What do you say?' she gasped at last.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302025">'His real name is Williamson,' Cardella laughed, 'but we call him
"Chronohotontologos."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302026">'It is most--extraordinary!' ejaculated Polly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302027">Chrono--why, her mouth would be out of shape for ever if she
contrived to pronounce half of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302028">'Why do you call Dr. Williamson strange?' he asked presently. 'I
assure you he is one of the very cleverest men you ever knew. Let me
introduce him to you; you'll be charmed with him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302029">'No, thank you,' returned Polly icily; 'I would rather not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302030">'But why?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302031">'I do not take much interest in--doctors,' she said calmly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302032">It was all Cardella could do to avoid expressing his amazement by a
long whistle. Fancy this lawyer's daughter turning up her nose at a
man like Williamson, particularly when she had gone to that very ball
under th auspices of Lewis, whose father had been master tailor of the
17th Hussars, and who himself had risen from the ranks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302033">'Must be a complete fool,' thought Cardella, with an intense desire
to burst out laughing. But when he took Polly back to her mother's
side, and a partner immediately claimed her, something in Mrs. Hugh's
fat bland face made him seat himself beside her. Dickson, happening
to pass just at that moment, felt 'the young fool' must have utterly
taken leave of his senses.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302034">'May I take you to have an ice or a glass of wine?' he asked courteously.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302035" n="195     SUPERSEDED"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302036">'Oh no, thank you. I enjoy looking on.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302037">'And so do I,' he responded. 'I suppose I ought to be hard at work introducing people, and so on; but I really hardly know a soul here, and I looked after most of the decorations.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302038">'You look tired,' said Mrs. Hugh blandly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302039">'I am a little tired,' he admitted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302040">'Ah, those tiresome field-days!' she responded sympathetically; 'I am sure they must be trying. I really do not know how you sacrifice yourselves so cheerfully; there must be so much restriction and general unpleasantness.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302041">'Well, it isn't so bad as Oxford,' he laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302042">'Oh! are you an Ox-ford man?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302043">'Yes '—wondering what she could find so astonishing in that.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302044">'My brother,' said Mrs. Hugh, with the air of a person playing the last trump, 'is the Dean of Brazenface.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302045">'Brazenface, 'Cardella repeated; 'what is his name?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302046">'Fullerton,' said Mrs. Hugh, more blandly than before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302047">'Not Billy?' the young man cried, forgetting his manners, and suddenly recalling the Dean.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302048">'Ye-es.' Her tone was a trifle less oily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302049">Oh, I remember Billy well enough '—utterly forgetting that it was her brother of whom they were speaking; 'yes, I knew Billy, and Billy knew me. Little fat man, with asquint.' The expression on her face made him all at once remember how completely he had set his foot in it; and, to cover his own embarrassment and her discomfiture, he began to speak volubly. 'And so he is your brother, Mrs. Antrobus? Why, what a little world it is, after all! I dare say you and I have lots of mutual friends, if we could only compare lists.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302050">Mrs. Hugh's fat countenance literally shone with delight. He thought, in a good-natured way, that she really was a very jolly old lady, and was evidently not prone to take offence; for he had certainly been extremely rude, and ninety-nine ladies out of a hundred would have never taken any notice of him again, but this one seemed to enjoy the joke as much as he did.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302052">Now, if Eliot Cardella had been in the Palace of Truth instead of the Blankhampton Assembly Rooms, he would have learned one or two things which would have surprised him not a little. First, that Mrs. Hugh Antrobus did not consider herself at all <hi rend="italic">old;</hi> and, also, that her beaming did not arise from the joke concerning Dean Billy, but from his having so—<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302051" n="196     CAVALRY LIFE"/>completely put himself upon a level with her. It was a new sensation for her to be thus chatting amicably with an earl's son, and, like the young gentleman in 'Locksley Hall,' she</p><q>'Looked into the future as far as eye could see.'</q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302053">In fact, she looked rather further, for she saw Polly, Polly no longer, but the Countess of Mallinbro'—she disposed of Viscount Cardella without any ceremony—a coronet on her fair brow and costly diamonds flashing upon her fair throat and rounded arms. Seeing all that, she might well beam.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302054">'<hi rend="italic">Good</hi>-night, Mr. Cardella,' she said, when he saw them into their cab an hour or two later. 'We shall be charmed if you will call.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302055">That cab was a great trial to Polly, but, with a little make-believe, it was easy to fancy it had C-springs and brocaded cushions; but, still, she was not sure that to Mr. Cardella it might make a difference.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_073" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302056">IT was the day after the ball. Major Creyke and ten or twelve officers, chiefly juniors, were at luncheon, and there was one guest, the chaplain.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302057">'I say, Mr. Brandon,' said the Major to the guest, 'did you happen to hear the riddle the Colonel asked the Dean last night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302058">'No; what was it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302059">'Why are two young ladies, kissing each other, performing an act of the highest Christian virtue?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302060">'Give it up,' said the chaplain at once.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302061">'It was quite ecclesiastical.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302062">Give it up,' he repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302063">'Because they are doing unto others as they would that men should do unto them—<hi rend="italic">men</hi>, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302064">'Oh, the point isn't exactly obscure!' laughed the chaplain. 'What did the Dean say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302065">'He bolted.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302066">'I should think so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302067">At that moment a discussion arose at the other end of the table, almost amounting to a squabble, in the midst of which one of the youngest officers rapped out an ugly word. The Major rose at once and rang the bell.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302068">'Mr. Brandon, will you take cherry brandy?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302069" n="197     SUPERSEDED"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302070">'Yes, thank you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302071">'So will I. You '—looking at the others present—'will have what you like; and,' turning to the servant, 'put it down to Mr. Cogner, for using bad language in Mr. Brandon's presence.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302072">For a moment the subaltern looked a little dismayed, but since there was no remedy for the Major's fiat but cheerful acquiescence and an avoidance of evil-speaking for the future, he was obliged to get over his chagrin as best he could.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302073">'By-the-by, Brandon,' remarked the Major presently, 'do you know anything of a man called Antrobus? you've been here longer than we have.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302074">'Lawyer?' the chaplain asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302075">'Yes; lives at a big house near the river, and has a pretty daughter.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302076">'No, I don't know them personally; they had not been there very long when you came; Captain Kennedy had that house before them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302077">'And you don't know anything about him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302078">'No, I can't say I do, except that he does a good deal in the money-lending way. Why do you ask?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302079">'Because they contrived to get to the ball last night—through Lewis, I suppose; if I'd known anything about him, I'd have struck his name off the list.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302080">'He's coming down the square now,' put in Dickson suddenly. 'I'm off!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302081">'So am I,' cried the Major. 'Come up to my rooms, Brandon, and have a cigar.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302082">In consequence of this, when Mr. Antrobus arrived at the anteroom, it was tenantless, and, having left the regulation amount of pasteboards, he was obliged to go away, as wise as he went. Even Eliot Cardella cleared out with the rest. It was all very well, he argued, to amuse himself for an hour or two with a pretty girl, but to entertain the old money-lending father, when all the other fellows had cleared out at his approach, was rather more than he felt inclined to do. More-Over, he had half promised the old woman to call, and, if he saw Mr. Antrobus then, he could hardly do that. Not that he had quite decided to call—he did not know, he was sure, whether it would be exactly wise—it would be almost like putting his head into the lion's mouth; and yet she was awfully pretty, there was no denying that.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302084">He went up to his room in a very undecided frame of mind. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302083" n="198     CAVALRY LIFE"/>He wanted to go and see Polly—what he did not want was the objectionable father and mother. He wondered impatiently why nice girls need have objectionable belongings; how much nicer it would be to 'shunt' them, as they do in the States!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302085">He drew a chair to the fire and smoked a pipe; then he changed his clothes, and sat down again in a greater state of indecision than before. They say that a certain road is paved with good intentions. Now, Eliot Cardella's intentions were undeniably good—in fact, they were rather better (in a worldly sense) than good, for they were cautious; and yet—yet he hesitated a little longer, and finally succumbed to the voice of the tempter, and betook himself to call at the River House. Polly was very pretty, and Eliot Cardella was particularly susceptible to feminine charms—as a consequence, four o'clock found him chatting pleasantly in the drawing—room at the River House with Mrs. Antrobus and Polly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302086">That visit was quickly followed by an invitation to dinner, which occasioned a little more hesitation on Cardella's part, and ended by being accepted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302087">Oh, that dinner-party! It lay like a leaden weight on Mrs. Hugh's mind for a week; she could not get rid of it, night or day—it was like a lump of indigestible pudding, and much worse than a bad conscience. Polly never worried herself about anything; she superintended the decorations of the table and put fresh flowers in the vases; then she dressed herself carefully and went down in good time, looking very graceful in a gown of pearly-gray silk, finished at the throat and wrists with some antique rose-point, which Mrs. Hugh <hi rend="italic">said</hi> had been her grandmother's. At her throat she had a bunch of large sweet-smelling purple violets, secured by a tiny brooch of seed pearls in the form of a leaf, and in her hair she had several clusters of the same fragrant blossoms. Polly certainly had some very good points: she was never impatient, and if she tried rather too much to model herself after Tennyson's heroine, who seemed to be very <hi rend="italic">haut ton</hi>—'Faultily faultless, icily regular, splendidly null, dead perfection'—why, she never condescended to anything so vulgar as quarrelling, and upon all occasions she was very pleasant to look upon. Some people may think that a very small virtue, for which Polly deserved no praise, but <hi rend="italic">men</hi> will all agree with me that it is a very great matter indeed.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302088" n="199     SUPERSEDED"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302089">As usual, Mrs. Hugh was late, and only scurried into the room as the first vehicle rolled up to the door. Polly, who had been gazing reflectively into the fire, turned, as Cardella's voice fell upon her ear, with a pretty pleased smile of welcome and—well, for once she was vexed, for there stood Mrs. Hugh, with her dress well tucked up about her, displaying a not too clean white petticoat, the long folds of silk gathered up under her arms, just for all the world as it was when she went into the kitchen in the morning to look after the cuisine. Polly could have shaken her, but, since that was impracticable, she interposed her own slight person and flowing draperies as much as she could between the Honourable Eliot and the vast bulk which she called 'mother,' and at the very first opportunity gave the dress a vigorous tug.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302090">'Do let your dress down, mamma!' she said in a sharp whisper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302091">'Dear me! how absent-minded I am,' remarked Mrs. Hugh blandly. 'I don't know what I should do, Polly, if I had not you to look after me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302092">Which, for Polly, was out of Scylla into Charybdis. She needn't have troubled herself: Cardella was not sufficiently interested in Mrs. Hugh to notice her; he only saw Polly, and thought she was looking prettier than usual, with that sudden deepening of the apple-blossom flush on her cheeks, and that shy uplifting of her blue eyes. And oh, by Jove! what a jolly gown she had got on. That jolly silvery gray, with such lace as his mother often wore, and those velvety, sweet-smelling violets, fastened by the little pearl brooch. He did not know much about dress, but he thought she looked very distinguished and quiet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302093">'I was so disappointed not to meet you at the Deanery last night,' he remarked, somewhat awkwardly for Polly, who had never been asked to the Deanery in her life, but, fortunately, he did not give her time to reply. 'Such a lot of hideous women there were, too,' he said resentfully, as if they had all been asked for his especial annoyance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302094">'Perhaps you are very hard to please,' she said softly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302095">'Oh, I know a pretty woman when I see one,' he returned coolly. 'What lovely violets you have; I smelt them the moment I entered the room.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302096">'The children got them for me,' Polly said deprecatingly. 'We generally have plenty in the hothouse.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302097" n="200     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302098">'I wish they would give me some,' he returned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302099">'You shall have some of these '—unfastening her brooch as she spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302100">'I will keep them for ever,' he said in a low voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302101">'Or throw them out of the cab window,' she laughed, 'like the gentleman in "Sweethearts."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302102">'I thought he threw them overboard,' Cardella murmured, lazily leaning against the chimney-shelf and regarding Polly with the well-satisfied air with which all men regard a pretty woman, leaving the tender passion quite out of the question.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302103">Oh yes, of course; he threw them overboard after all the protestations he made, but she—kept hers.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302104">'Never make protestations myself,' he remarked; 'awfully bad plan.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302105">'I thought you said you would keep those violets for ever,' said Polly, raising her blue eyes for an instant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302106">'By Jove, what pretty eyes!' thought Cardella; then, aloud, ' So I shall.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302107">`Oh, nonsense!' the girl laughed, twisting one or two of the flowers in her slender fingers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302108">'Don't you believe me?'—throwing a little extra warmth into his tone that he might make her look up again. A moment later he wished he had not succeeded; the full glance of her eyes had disappointed him. They were pretty in colouring, but there was no soul looking through those blue windows; the face was nearly perfect, for the only approach to a fault lay in the mouth, and he noticed nothing beyond the red ripe lips and the even pearly teeth, but it was quite expressionless: there was no fun playing about the mouth, there was no awakening of that fierce fire which lived in his susceptible heart; it was an artistic mask—'icily regular, splendidly null, dead perfection.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302109">'Do you never keep your souvenirs?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302110">'<hi rend="italic">I</hi>? Oh no!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302111">For the first time a gleam of expression came into her face and eyes—a half-quizzical, half-dismayed look, which made him forget his disappointment, and think how awfully pretty she was. If her sense of humour was somewhat latent, it was there, and Cardella was just in the frame of mind to enjoy calling up an unusual trait in her character, more than if she had been clever enough to see and appreciate every little joke that cropped up.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302112" n="201     SUPERSEDED"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302113">She contrived—quite accidentically, of course—to pilot her 'gentleman' to the seat next to Eliot, who had taken in Mrs. Hugh, and presently, under cover of the general chatter and Mrs. Hugh's benignant attention to her right-hand neighbour, he contrived to inform Polly that he thought her name remarkably pretty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302114">'Mary?' she said inquiringly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302115">'No, Polly. There is something very soft and sweet-sounding about it, and really, in these fine days, anything homely and old—fashioned is pretty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302116">'It has the advantage of being both,' Polly said, with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302117">'It has. Now, my mother is called Gladys Elizabeth Tudor, but my father always calls her Nancy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302118">I like that,' remarked Polly with great decision. It was true. If the Countess of Mallinbro' was called 'Nancy,' it would create no surprise if her daughter-in-law was named 'Polly.' All the same, she made up her mind that if she ever came to be the Honourable Mrs. Eliot Cardella she would spare no pains to have the name of Polly put aside in favour of May.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302119">Practically, Polly finished the Honourable Eliot off that night, for after dinner she sang—it was only a simple ballad she chose, and her voice was not a fine one, though she sang expressively. He had heard the song scores of times: he had heard it sung by the great Canadian singer at amateur concerts; in drawing-rooms such as this; ground out of barrel-organs; and yet there he was listening to it again, with all his soul in his eyes and a strange yearning and fluttering at his heart, such as Polly's dead perfection by itself could never have had power to bring there.</p><q><lg><l>'What made the assembly shine?</l><l>Robin Adair!</l><l> What made the ball so fine?</l><l>Robin was there!</l><l> What, when the play was o'er,</l><l> What made my heart so sore?</l><l> Oh, it was parting with—</l><l>Robin Adair!'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302120">Music had always been a passion with him; that dear, quaint old ballad conquered him—the Earl's son: and Polly was the daughter of a not too reputable attorney.

Two men were talking in Captain Dickson's room; at least, Eliot Cardella was talking, and Dickson, lounging in a chair, with a pipe in his mouth and clothed in very much besplashed cords and pink, was listening attentively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302123">'And so you've regularly got let in,' he remarked, between the puffs at his pipe, when Cardella had finished what he was saying;' and what are you going to do?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302124">'Dashed if I know!' he said ruefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302125">'What'll your father say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302126">'Say?—he'll tell me to go to the devil, as sure as fate. You see, Dickson, blood is his hobby. He wouldn't care if Cardella and I married girls without a farthing so long as their pedigrees were all right, but——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302127">'The daughter of a money-lending country attorney, with rather a shady reputation into the bargain,' suggested Dickson, 'will hardly be likely to meet with a warm welcome, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302128">'Just drive him frantic,' returned Eliot promptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302129">''Pon my soul, you are an ass,' Dickson laughed, with delightful frankness; 'because, you know, I warned you from the beginning what it would lead to.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302130">'So you did; but, then, I never dreamt of its coming to this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302131">'But they did. I should exchange into a regiment in India, and cut the whole concern, if I were you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302132">'Oh, I couldn't very well do that,' Cardella returned doubtfully; 'what would she think?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302133">'Oh, well, if you want to many her——' Dickson began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302134">'Why, I like Polly well enough,' he said hesitatingly;' and, if it was not for the governor, I'd marry her at once and cut the lot, though I'm not exactly——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302135">'In love with her?' Dickson suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302136">'Yes, just so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302137">'Well, my dear chap, I don't see how I can help you—I'd go in and make violent love to her myself, if I thought she would throw you over for me, but I am sure she would not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302138">'You are a much richer man than I am.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302139">'But you've got a handle to your name,' rejoined the other. 'No, really, I don't see what you are to do but go on with it, or get out of the country and cut the whole concern.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302140" n="203     SUPERSEDED"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302141">'Cardella's coming to-morrow, for a fortnight's hunting,' said Eliot dismally.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302142">There really seemed to be no loophole for escape. The more Eliot Cardella pondered over the fix into which he had got himself, the worse did his situation appear. He had gone through the whole family programme; Mrs. Hugh had attempted—ineffectually, it is true—to embrace him; her husband had wrung his hand and pretended to dash away a few tears at the same time; the two younger sisters at once began to call him Eliot, with what seemed to him unnecessary distinctness and vain repetition; and the young cub of a brother, who was, he believed, 'articled' to his father, had linked his arm in his future brother-in-law's and walked the whole length of the High Street with him—after which he had gone back to barracks in a towering rage and relieved his mind by making a confidant of Dickson, who could see as far through a milestone as most men.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302143">And the cream of the whole affair was that he was not in love with Polly a bit; he liked her well enough, and certainly admired her; but her belongings—they very nearly maddened him; what effect they would have upon his father he was afraid to think—the courtly old Earl who had married the dark-eyed, olive-skinned daughter of a Duke, and who would see no charm in Polly's fresh, fair, apple-blossom loveliness. Why, he would not admire Venus herself if a drop of plebeian blood ran in her veins. What would he think of Polly?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302144">The following day Viscount Cardella arrived at Blankhampton, and established himself at the sign of the Golden Swan. Between the brothers there was a striking likeness, but the Viscount was larger, fairer, handsomer than Eliot, and with even more of the old Earl's courtly grace about him, and decidedly a greater capacity for flirting than his brother.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302145">As soon as he had asked after home, Eliot plunged headforemost into the subject just then uppermost in his thoughts.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302146">'I'm going to get married, Cardella,' he announced abruptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302147">'Going to get married, are you?' returned the Viscount, whom for the future we shall call Cardella; 'what a fool you must be!' with great cheerfulness. 'Is she good-looking?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302148">'Very.' Eliot wished everything was as satisfactory as Polly's looks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302149">'Who is she?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302150">'Her name is Antrobus.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302151" n="204     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302152">'Antrobus—never met her. Got any money? Who's her father?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302153">'I don't think she'll have much money,' Eliot said dubiously, 'and her father's a lawyer.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302154">'A <hi rend="italic">lawyer</hi>!' Cardella exclaimed, all the cheerful interest vanishing from face and voice. 'You mean a barrister?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302155">'I mean a lawyer,' returned Eliot firmly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302156">'Good life!—what will the Earl say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302157">'I dare say he will cut me,' Eliot answered with a nervous laugh, which he tried vainly to make defiant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302158">'And you've fallen in love?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302159">'No, I haven't. I like her very well, but—oh, d——it all, Cardella! I've got let in, so I must take the consequences. I always was the fool of the family.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302160">Cardella said nothing, but sat looking into the fire with a grave face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302161">'There'll be all the more money for you if the governor cuts me off,' Eliot said bitterly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302162">'Don't suggest anything so horrid, my dear old chap; there will be enough for both of us,' Cardella answered soothingly. 'I was only thinking, if you really don't care for this girl, it seems a pity to spoil your whole life. I tell you what, you must take me to see her. Can you take me to dinner to-night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302163">'They told me to take you—like their cheek!' he cried angrily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302164">'Then, send a note up at once. I shall know better what to do when I've seen them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302165">The result of this was, that Lord Cardella and the Honourable Eliot went that evening to dine <hi rend="italic">en famille</hi> at the River House. Eliot thought his brother had taken leave of his senses, for the moment he beheld Polly he, metaphorically speaking, fell down and worshipped her, which, with the utter unreasonableness of human nature, he highly resented. Hang it all! but it was too bad of Cardella to go poaching on his manor like that. Of course, if he chose to marry Polly, the Earl's pleasure or displeasure would make but small difference to him, since the personal property was nothing in comparison with the entailed estates. Therefore, when Cardella went back to his hotel, Eliot turned in the direction of the barracks with a sulky ' Good-night,' at which the Viscount laughed out aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302167">It happened that the next afternoon, when returning from <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302166" n="205     SUPERSEDED"/>hunting, he fell in with Dickson, and, after a little desultory chat, suddenly remarked:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302168">'By the way, Dickson, can you tell me anything about these people my young brother's got mixed up with?'—Eliot was five-and-twenty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302169">'I don't know them myself,' Dickson replied, 'but I understand the father's a third-rate attorney, who does a good deal in the money-lending line.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302170">'Ah!' murmured the Viscount comprehensively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302171">But Captain Dickson's information made no difference whatever in his manner towards the family at the River House. He told Mrs. Hugh that Polly was a perfect aristocrat, at which Mrs. Hugh beamed so intensely that the Viscount caught himself wondering what he should do if any part of her skin gave way.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302172">He assailed Polly on her weakest points. He from the first refused to call her Polly, as a name utterly unsuited to her delicate style of beauty: he invariably called her <hi rend="italic">May</hi>. He monopolized her altogether. Eliot looked sulkily on, whilst Cardella sauntered about the town with his <hi rend="italic">fiancée</hi>, or hung over her at the piano. His horses stood idle in their stables, for though he had gone to Blankhampton for the express purpose of hunting, he spent all his mornings in the drawing-room at the River House, <hi rend="italic">tête-à-tête</hi> with Polly, and invariably to the intense astonishment and surprise of Mrs. Hugh, when he made his appearance in the dining-room, and begged, with the courtly grace which had broken a score or so of hearts, for luncheon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302173">Polly's manner to Eliot grew colder and colder. He was all very well, she argued, but <hi rend="italic">only</hi> a second son, after all. Lord Cardella was more her style; the way he made love—and he made very desperate love indeed—was so different to Eliot, who had seized hold of her, and almost crushed her to death. Lord Cardella was accustomed to lift her hand to his lips in a manner Polly thought most entrancing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302174">Of course, to be the Honourable Mrs. Eliot Cardella would be an enviable position, but the Countess of Mallinbro'—ah! that was her true sphere.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302176">And so the days crept on, lengthening as they passed, and Cardella still lingered at Blankhampton. The breach between the brothers grew wider and wider, and bets began to pass freely among the Cuirassiers as to which would come off the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302175" n="206     CAVALRY LIFE"/>victor. They all thought them both a couple of fools for their pains, but, of course, they knew their own business best.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302177">Cardella's devotion to Polly grew more and more tender Eliot's face sulkier, and his temper more uncertain, until at length Mr. Antrobus took him into the library, and asked if it was true that his income depended entirely on his father's caprice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302178">'Quite true,' Eliot returned, 'except for ten thousand under my mother's settlement.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302179">'Then, I think it will be best for the engagement between you and my daughter to come to an end,' he said gravely. 'I am not a rich man, and I have three other children to provide for. It had best end.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302180">'I decline to give her up,' Eliot answered hotly, 'excepting she writes and tells me she does not care for me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302181">'I think she will do so,' said Mr. Antrobus quietly; 'I believe I am doing what is best for the happiness of you both.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302182">When Eliot got back to barracks, he found his brother in the anteroom, having, for a wonder, gone to lunch there, instead of to the River House. During the meal a note was brought in, addressed in Polly's well-known caligraphy:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302183">' The Hon. Eliot Cardella,
<lb/>Cuirassiers.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302184">Eliot knew its purport before he opened it. It ran:</p><q><q><floatingText xml:id="jwcaval_12031"><body xml:id="jwcaval_12030"><div xml:id="jwcaval_341" type="letter"><opener><salute>' MY DEAR ELIOT,</salute></opener><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302185">'I think my father's decision is for the best, but I hope we shall remain all our lives sincere friends.</p><closer><salute>' Believe me, always truly yours,</salute><signed>'MARY ANTROBUS.'</signed></closer></div></body></floatingText></q></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302186">That was the end of it. He put the note in his pocket, and asked Cardella presently to go up to his room:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302187">' I've something to show you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302188">Cardella, who had resolutely refused to acknowledge any cloud between his brother and himself, followed him, and Eliot put the note into his hands with a laugh and one word—'Superseded.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302190">' Look here, Eliot,' he said, when he had read it, ' I have got you out of the most confounded scrape you ever were in in all your life.

I am not a spider; therefore I cannot evolve a new gown out of my own inner consciousness.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302195">'Let me give you a gown—two gowns,' pleaded Jack Sinclair, flushing a little under the girl's steady gaze, yet looking very handsome and soldierly in the brilliant June sunshine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302196">'My good Jack,' returned Miss St. George quietly, 'have you sufficient money to pay your debts?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302197">'No,' he admitted unwillingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302198">'Then, how can you afford to buy me gowns? And how can you imagine for one moment that I should take them, if you could?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302199">'If you loved me——' he began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302200">'My good Jack,' said the girl again, gravely, lifting her azure eyes leisurely to his, ' it seems to me you are a great deal too well assured of the state of my feelings. Some people, you know, have a habit of counting their chickens before they are hatched.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302201">'Oh, Dolly, you do love me!' he cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302202">'Perhaps just a little'—half indifferently—'certainly not enough to let you buy me—<hi rend="italic">clothes!</hi>'—with a sudden shamed flush at the bare idea of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302204">Jack Sinclair sighed impatiently. He had no such pride himself; but then, to be sure, no cavalry officers ever have, except they are rank men. He that very morning had shaved <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302203" n="208     CAVALRY LIFE"/>himself in Broughton's room, because Broughton had just had his razors ground; he had passed on to the next room to sponge the remains of the lather off his face, because Broughton was using his sponge and basin for a like purpose; he had borrowed a collar-stud on his way back to his own quarters, because his laundress had sent his shirt home minus a button at the throat; and before he finished dressing he had lent his last clean cotton tie to Dickson, who had got two days' leave; he had surrendered his hair-brushes to Squints, who had walked in for no apparent reason—perhaps because someone was using his—and had helped Ponto out of a difficulty by the loan of a shell-jacket. Thus Jack Sinclair, accustomed to regard his belongings and those of his brother officers as public property, could not understand why the suggestion that he should buy his <hi rend="italic">fiancée</hi>? a gown—which, goodness knows, she stood sorely in need of—need bring that shamed flush to her proud face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302205">'Then, how will you do?' he asked at length, rather ruefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302206">'Stay at home,' she laughed, then sang, in a rich, mellow voice:</p><q><l>'"Stay, stay at home, my heart, and rest;</l><l>Home-keeping hearts are happiest!"'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302207">'Oh, I dare say!' Jack put in very ruefully indeed. But the girl only laughed, and sang on:</p><q><l>'"For those that wander, they know not where,</l><l>Are full of trouble and full of care;</l><l>To stay at home is best.'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302208">'But, Dolly, my darling,' he interrupted, 'couldn't Mrs. St. George lend you a dress?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302209">'Mrs. St. George,' answered Dorothy, regarding him gravely, yet with laughter in her brilliant eyes, 'is possessed of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> presentable gown besides the one you see her in every day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302210">'I'm sure she would lend it to you,' cried Jack.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302211">'It is a <hi rend="italic">moiré antique</hi>,' said Dorothy, as if there need be nothing more said upon the subject.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302212">'Well, what of that? I remember, the last time I was at home my mother was wearing one—a bright green one it was, with white-pot buttons. She said they were porcelain, but I knew better.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302213">'Ah!' remarked Dorothy, without much interest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302214">'Then, you'll come to the sports to-morrow, darling!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302216">'The <hi rend="italic">moiré</hi>,' returned Dorothy, 'is of the most startling <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302215" n="209     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/>rose-colour you ever saw. Why, Jack, all the women would be laughing at us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302217">'Let them,' he rejoined fiercely; 'who cares?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302218">'I do, for one. No, Jack; some day, when we are rich, I will go to the sports; and I'll give a cup, and you shall run for it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302219">'I don't see why you can't come in the gown you've got on,' he grumbled; 'it looks awfully jolly;' but, all the same, he was very well aware that the garment in question was very, very shabby; it was so entirely out of keeping with its wearer. Jack thought, as he watched her that lovely June day, that he had never seen a more perfect picture than she made as she sat upon the river's bank, the willows and the turf making a background against which her radiant loveliness shone out more like a gem in a dark setting than anything else he could think of. She had taken off her hat, and the sunshine streamed down upon her golden head, giving the heavy braids the appearance of a diadem. Jack wished passionately that he could have given her a crown of rubies and diamonds; and yet he knew that no gold would ever become her as did those imperial coils of lustrous hair, no sapphires could ever equal the beauty of her azure eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302220">And yet she was so very, very shabby; her brown stuff gown was positively threadbare—' bright as a sixpence,' she said. One little foot was visible beneath the frill of her gown, and an inch or two of a slender ankle. They—the foot and the ankle—were all right; Jack had admired them dozens of times; but the boot which covered the foot—oh, it made him absolutely shiver!—seven-and-sixpence a pair, with square toes that seemed to be of an inquiring turn! Ugh! Jack looked from them to his own patent leather and canvas boots at thirty-five shillings a pair, and thought of the dozen or two of others which stood all in a neat row in the lowest compartment of his cupboard, and he had the grace to feel ashamed of himself. If Dorothy St. George could case her little slender feet in such boots as those and keep out of debt, why need he, a great hulking brute, with feet like potatoes, have a bootmaker's bill as long as his arm?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302222">He looked, too, at her little hands folded idly before her—such pretty hands, with pink-tinted filbert nails; then his eyes fell upon a certain mark along the forefinger of the one which lay uppermost, and, bending down, he kissed it as if he would fain kiss that disfiguring seam away. Oh, why should she have <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302221" n="210     CAVALRY LIFE"/>to work so hard, whilst his sisters, not half so fair, dawdled their time away, and gave dresses to their maid such as Dorothy could never afford to buy? Oh, why should it be? A flush mounted to the young man's brow, and his eyes sank before the glory of hers. The question was easy to answer. He had ' sown the wind ' in a long course of reckless extravagance, in the raising of his father's just anger; now he was ' reaping the whirlwind ' in banishment from home, and in the pain of knowing that between Dorothy St. George and him lay a long array of debts which he had no money to pay.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302223">And there are people who say our sins do not find us out in this world!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302224">'Oh, my darling!' he cried, with a sudden burst of passion, ' how I will make up to you for all this some day!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302225">'Some day,' she repeated wistfully; ' if, by the time you come into your kingdom, you have not repented, Jack.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302226">'Repented! Why?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302227">'You will be rich, I still poor.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302228">'Supposing I remained always poor, and you became very rich, would you desert me, Dolly?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302229">'I cannot say, I am sure,' she laughed. 'I have always been so awfully poor, you see, that if I were suddenly lifted up in the world I might tiptilt my nose even at you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302230">'Ah, you don't mean that,' he said coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302231">'"There's many a true word spoken in jest,"' she quoted gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302232">'Then, thank God, there is no chance of it!' he cried vehemently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302233">'No, indeed,' with a smile, half bitter, half sad.' Do you know, Jack, that I don't know who I am? I never shall know it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302234">'Yes, yes; you told me. Don't talk about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302236">'But I must talk about it. I'll tell you now,' she answered. 'To begin at the beginning, I must tell you my mother's name was Meredith. At sixteen she was left to the care of her uncle, a clergyman in North Wales. Her father also had been a clergyman. She had not been many weeks at Llangwylt before she met my father, who was staying in the neighbourhood for the trout-fishing. He fell in love with her and married her; my great-uncle married them himself. After the marriage they went abroad; and one day it came out quite by chance that he had been married under a false name—George St. George. He assured her that the legality of the marriage was <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302235" n="211     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/>certain. He told her also that his reason for deceiving her was because his uncle, who had very large unentailed estates, had arranged a marriage for him, and, if he heard anything of my mother, would probably cut him off with but a very small property. My mother never troubled herself about it; she loved him, and she had perfect faith in him, and so a few months passed over. He seems, although quite young, being only seven-and-twenty at the time of the marriage, to have had a most passionate and unforgiving temper, as my mother found to her cost—and mine; for one day she angered him so much that he left her. I fancy she had been in a passion herself, and had cried out that she no longer loved him. Whatever it was, he never forgot it or forgave it. "You shall never see me again," he told her; "<hi rend="italic">and you shall never know who you are</hi>." From that day to this she has never seen him. For anything we know to the contrary, he may have been a chimney-sweeper. Mother went back to Llangwylt, and I was born there; and when her uncle died six years ago, we came here—to starve upon seventy pounds a year,' she broke off bitterly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302237">'Did she never try to find him out?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302238">'Uncle Meredith wished to do so, but mother was too proud.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302239">'What a strange story!' Jack said thoughtfully; 'and, oh, by Jove! what a beastly temper he must have had!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302240">' Ah! that's where mine comes from,' rejoined Dorothy calmly. 'Who's that, Jack?' as a boat passed them, a graceful outrigger, with a man in white flannels, who came as near to the bank as he could venture, evidently to stare at her, and who, after a salutation to Jack, sculled away, and was out of sight in no time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302241">'That, my darling, is the handsomest man in the service,' Jack answered. 'We call him the Lady-Killer-in-Chief.'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_082" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302243">THE Lady-Killer-in-Chief had changed his flannels for his ordinary clothes—light gray trousers and a coat of gray velveteen. He certainly, as he sauntered down the High Street at Blankhampton, merited the homage which was paid to his personal appearance when his brother officers spoke of him as the handsomest man in the service. The only fault in his face was its extreme coldness: cold classic features; cold <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302242" n="212     CAVALRY LIFE"/>
blonde hair, irreproachably parted down the middle, and brushed straight away behind his ears without a hair being out of place; cold hazel eyes, large and beautiful in themselves; and a cold smile, like the flickering of a feeble winter sun over snow-topped mountains. An utterly cold manner, too—which to women seemed irresistible—and perhaps the most cutting caustic wit that had ever made itself felt in the mess-room of the Blankhampton Barracks. Swaggering leisurely down the High Street, he met with Dickson, who, as a matter of course, stopped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302244">'Where have you been?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302245">'I've been for a pull. The river's awfully jolly to-day, and, by-the-by, Dickson'—plunging at once into the subject uppermost in his thoughts—' can you tell me who that girl is Sinclair goes about with—tall girl with golden hair?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302246">'I don't know her name. I believe Sinclair's going to marry her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302247">'Going to marry her! Ah! is it settled?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302248">'I really don't know. She's a very handsome girl,' remarked Dickson carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302249">'Uncommonly,' Montagu replied with what, for him, was great warmth. 'And so Sinclair's serious?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302250">'Oh, quite so!' adding with a laugh, 'Has she "taken" you rather? No use; she's awfully in love with Sinclair.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302251">'Pooh! I'll cut him out in a week,' cried Montagu confidently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302252">'I don't believe she'll look at you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302253">'Won't she? Well, you'll see;' and then the two men parted, and went their respective ways, neither of them in the least aware that the subject of their conversation was just within the door of the shop behind them, and had heard their whole conversation, with proud scorn filling her violet eyes, and utter contempt on her imperious mouth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302254">Bryan Montagu did not find the task he had set himself altogether easy to accomplish, for he could not succeed in making a start. In the first place, he did not know who she was, nor where she lived; and since he never met her anywhere he could not obtain an introduction. However, at last he happened to meet her with Sinclair in a shop, and asked boldly to be introduced.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302256">Miss St. George was very gracious to him. She smiled so enchantingly that Jack straightway went off into a towering <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302255" n="213     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/>rage and scolded her all the way home, at which she laughed more heartily than he had ever heard her laugh in his life. To add to his wrath, Montagu informed him during dinner that Miss St. George was really very decent-looking; 'and I believe I passed you on the river one day last week,' he ended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302257">`Yes, and you turned and stared at her as if she'd been some little milliner-girl,' Jack returned sulkily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302258">'The penalty of beauty, my dear chap,' laughed Montagu lightly. ' Now, I assure you I'm so accustomed to be ogled that I should feel quite uncomfortable with people who didn't admire me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302259">'Miss St. George doesn't admire you, at all events,' retorted Jack with a short laugh, 'for she says she never saw such a "screw," in her life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302260">At which Bryan Montagu, who was really a very pretty oar, though, perhaps, with a slight tendency to 'screw,' was for once taken aback, and registered an inward vow that before many days were over he would pay Miss St. George out with interest for that unflattering remark. And pay her out—how? As he had made many another girl suffer before—brokenhearted for the cold hazel eyes which for her had been wont to have no coldness in their clear depths; for the straight-featured classic face which had made itself her heaven; for the sound of the smooth, persuasive voice which would fall upon her ears never more, or, if perchance it did so, fraught only with slighting indifference, more hard to bear than silence. That was the plan Mr. Bryan Montagu marked out as Miss St. George's punishment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302261">Accordingly, the following afternoon, instead of betaking himself to the club, or his more favourite river, he turned in the direction of the village in which Mrs. St. George's little house was; and, as luck would have it, just as he passed the Cotherstones' house he saw Miss St. George emerge from the gate of her cottage, and turn down the lane leading to the river. He followed instantly, and reached her just as she was about to pass through the little gate which opened into the River Fields.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302262">Mr. Montagu lifted his hat with his most fascinating smile. Miss St. George blushed becomingly, and half drooped her splendid eyes. Mr. Montagu thought he had never before beheld so lovely a face. Miss St. George thought—well, she <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> as if she found herself in Arcadia.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302263" n="214     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302264">'You are going for a walk?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302265">'Well, no. I am going to sit by the edge of the river and read,' she replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302266">'May I come with you and talk instead?' he asked imploringly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302267">'Oh yes, if you like,' she replied calmly, thinking what a lucky thing it was that Jack was safely out of the road, being on duty that day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302268">Anyone who could have heard their conversation that afternoon must have laughed, even if it had been Jack Sinclair himself; they were so awfully polite, to begin with; each seemed to be trying how fascinating he or she could be; each seemed so desperately anxious to make the other pleased. They got along like a house on fire, which is, as everyone knows, a tolerably rapid rate. In fact, they got on so well that Mr. Montagu had already advanced as tar as personal compliments ere Miss St. George found out she really <hi rend="italic">must</hi> be going home, with an emphasis on the 'must,' by which she evidently intended to convey to him the fact that only stern necessity compelled her to move at all. But they got still further before they reached the gate of Mrs. St. George's cottage; for after a little circumlocution she promised to meet him at the same time and place the following afternoon. All the same, she raised but very little objection before she consented, and Mr. Montagu felt he had never come across a cherry so ripe and ready to fall into his mouth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302269">'Hollo, Sinclair!' he called out to Jack, whom he met in the square. 'Down in the mouth, eh? Ah, it's an awful nuisance not being able to get out of the square, isn't it? Particularly when there's a nice young woman half a mile off waiting for you. And she <hi rend="italic">did</hi> look so nice this afternoon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302270">The hot anger leapt into Jack Sinclair's gray eyes, but his heart grew cold as lead within him, for he had never felt very sure of Dorothy; and if Montagu made up his mind to go in for her, he knew well enough that he would spare no pains to accomplish the desirable attainment of putting his (Jack's, that is) nose out of joint.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302271">'How do you know?' he growled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302272">'Because she has been with me for the last three hours, Montagu returned coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302273">'I don't believe it!' poor Jack thundered; but all the same he felt from the other's manner that it was true.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302274" n="215     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302275">'Just as you like, of course, my dear chap,' said Montagu carelessly; 'but go along the path leading through the River Fields to-morrow afternoon between three and four, and you will see for yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302276">Sinclair turned away without answering, for Montagu's quiet manner had left him without hope. Of course the following afternoon he went, and saw for himself that his comrade had spoken truly. There, just visible above the river's bank, was Dorothy's hatless golden head, and in suspicious nearness to it Montagu's sleek blonde <hi rend="italic">caput</hi>; and whilst he stood there watching and half hidden by the hedge, her merry laugh rang out upon the still summer air in a peal which re-echoed in Jack's heart like the death-knell of all his dearest hopes. Oh, he was reaping the whirlwind, and no mistake about it!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302277">'Now, did you do as I advised?' Montagu asked him at mess that night, in a tone of sneering triumph. 'Are you convinced?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302278">'Hang you!' cried poor Jack passionately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302279">'By no means,' returned Montagu calmly, going on with his dinner as if that was the chief object of his existence. 'You shouldn't allow yourself to fly in such transports of rage, my dear chap; it's not good form, to begin with; it's bad for the digestion—bad every way. You're a deuced good fellow, Sinclair, but you go into everything with such terrible earnestness. It spoils you, my dear fellow; and it will be getting you into trouble one of these days, take my word for it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302280">But during the weeks which followed Jack's rage had time enough to cool. As far as Dorothy was concerned, he had resigned in favour of Bryan Montagu, who had contrived to get the entrée to the house, and who pretty nearly lived there. Twice Dorothy had written to know why he kept away, and to ask him to come; and both times he had sent a formal reply, declining the invitation. He scarcely went outside the barracks, and when he did so, went between six and seven—a time when he knew Dorothy was very unlikely to be out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302282">At last, however, he was one day compelled to go into the town early in the afternoon; and about half-way down the High Street he saw Dorothy and Montagu coming on the same side of the street. They were close upon him before he perceived them, but he did not hesitate a moment. He turned sharply to the right, and crossed over to the other side without so much as a look, and without any recognition whatever. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302281" n="216     CAVALRY LIFE"/>Dorothy turned very white, but she kept a brave front to the world, and laughed it off as usual. Montagu tackled Jack upon the subject that evening.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302283">'Now, I tell you what it is, Sinclair,' he said, leaning back in his chair and surveying Jack with much amusement in his eyes: 'your behaviour is what <hi rend="italic">I</hi> call uncommonly shabby. Blow hot, blow cold, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302284">'Mind your own business,' returned Jack sulkily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302285">'Ah, conscience touching you up a bit, eh? Well, it's what you must expect, whilst you behave as you've done lately. Oh, Sinclair, you've a great deal to answer for! You've brought desolation into a once happy home, grief to a once happy heart. Of course, it's right and proper that you should pay attention to the fair sex; their youth and beauty demand it; the honour of your regiment requires it; but you should not concentrate your attentions, my dear chap—you should not concentrate; they should be more general and less marked.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302286">But Jack was as sulky as a bear with a sore head, and would have no argument on the subject, so Montagu was obliged to have it all to himself. Not that that had any effect on his tongue; he never let Jack rest a moment</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302287">'Ah, you may well look so blue,' he would cry, 'with such a conscience as you must have—enough to give you the blue devils for the rest of your life! Think of the young affections you have blighted, think of the irreparable injury your heartless conduct has wrought, think of the gay hearth now made desolate, the light heart which will be light no more. Look at him, gentlemen'—appealing, after the manner of a counsel in a court of justice, to the grinning officers round about—' look at the depraved individual who stands before you, the male flirt. Ah, well, well, Sinclair, of all my sins—and they are many—I do not carry on my conscience the shameful weight of young fresh affections trifled with, won, and thrown aside.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302289">Poor Jack! he met Dorothy often enough now. Dorothy always alone, with no Bryan Montagu in attendance, but with, oh, such a blanched face, such a world of woe in the azure eyes, that if Jack had wished for revenge, there it was. But Jack wished for nothing of the kind. The sight of his false love's white face only made him miserable, so utterly miserable that he could have fallen down upon his knees in the very street, and prayed her to try and look happier; he could have <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302288" n="217     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/>choked the very life out of Montagu as he sat sneering and jibing at the mess-table, only that would not give him back to Dorothy, or take away that piteous woe from her face. And then Montagu took his long leave, and Dorothy grew whiter and whiter, until at length he missed her altogether, and feared she must be ill.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302290">Once or twice he felt half inclined to ignore the past and go and see her, but the remembrance that she was fretting for Montagu kept him back. She wanted Montagu, and Jack Sinclair would be of no use; and so when his turn came for long leave he went away, sore at heart as was ever Dorothy St. George, with hers breaking for love of the man who bore the nickname of the Lady-Killer-in-Chief.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_083" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302291">THE Cuirassiers had left Blankhampton for Colchester,<hi rend="italic">en route</hi> for India, and Dorothy St. George had seen nothing more of her two lovers since the day that Jack Sinclair went away on long leave. True, Bryan Montagu had called twice; but Dorothy had not seen him, being indisposed—otherwise lying on her bed in the exhaustion which usually comes after violent weeping. Mr. Montagu had stayed half an hour each time, talking serenely with Mrs. St. George, and left, with graceful regrets that Miss St. George was not well enough to see him; and that had been all, that was the end. And yet she could not forget the past; she was not allowed to go out of the house, for a terrible cough had taken hold of her; she could not rest anywhere: she thought herself that she was going mad. As the year drew to a close, and the day fixed for the embarkation of the regiment drew near, she persuaded her mother to take a daily paper, that she might see the latest, and indeed last, intelligence of them. She was not hard to persuade, for a great dread had come over her, lest her child, who was all she had in the world, should be taken from her; so for a time the paper was left at the house daily. The news about the Cuirassiers was but scanty, and Dorothy used to fling the paper down and sigh piteously each day. hoping that the next would tell more. And at last the sight of their own name caught her eye, and she for the first time looked at the paper with an interest unconnected with the Royal Regiment of Cuirassiers.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302292" n="218     CAVALRY LIFE"/><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302293">'If this should meet the eye of Florence Meredith, who, in September 18—, was married in the parish church of Llangwylt, North Wales, by the Rev.

Owen, Lucas, and Co., Gray's Inn Road, London, when she will hear of something to her advantage.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302294">Dorothy read it aloud to her mother.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302295">'What does it mean?' she cried, thinking it might have something to do with—with——</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302296">'It is to say your father is dead,' Mrs. St. George replied, an ashen hue overspreading her face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302297">'And you will write?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302298">'At once,' she said, in a trembling voice. 'If he has relented, things may be very different for us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302299">Two days passed by, and no reply. Dorothy was wildly curious, fretfully impatient, and, when on the second morning the postman passed the house, intensely disappointed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302300">'I believe it is a hoax!' she cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302301">But it was not so. Towards noon an imperative knock resounded through the house, and the woman who had gone every day to help since Dorothy's illness ushered into the tiny sitting-room a small grave gentleman, clad in black, and with an irreproachable white neckcloth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302302">'Mrs. St. George?' he said, with a grave bow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302303">'Yes,' she answered, rather faintly. 'Are you——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302304">'My name is Lucas. May I ask if this is your daughter?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302305">'That is Miss St. George,' she answered haughtily. The words 'your daughter' rather angered her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302306">'Pardon me,' said the little old gentleman politely. 'This lady,' taking Dorothy's hand and leading her a step forward, 'is the Countess of Beaurivage. You are now the Countess-dowager;' at which theatrically-told piece of news Dorothy burst out laughing, and her mother sat down and quietly fainted away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302307">Not only had great honour come upon them, but also great wealth. The lately-deceased Earl had managed, shortly before his death, to pick a violent quarrel with the heir-presumptive, and, to annoy him, had left a will giving an exact account of his marriage and what had taken place since, and leaving every farthing he possessed to his daughter; his wife he left unnoticed; but then, as Dorothy said, it didn't much matter. And so the sailing of the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi> passed apparently out of mind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302309">The romantic story of the Earl of Beaurivage's marriage, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302308" n="219     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/>and the succession of the beautiful young girl to the title, was naturally enough wafted into all the papers. Those containing it were handed on board the <hi rend="italic">Crocodile</hi> at Malta, and read almost simultaneously by the two men who had known Dorothy St. George most intimately in her days of poverty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302310">'Think what you've missed, Sinclair!' drawled Montagu. 'Who would have thought of little St. George turning out a Countess in her own right? By Jove! it almost equals a novel!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302311">'I suppose you'll find it worth while to go back and marry her now?' said Jack bitterly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302312">'Pooh! not I! I amused myself with her; but as for marrying——' He did not finish the sentence, for Jack flew at him like a tiger, and flung him head-foremost down the companion-ladder; whence Mr. Bryan Montagu was picked up extensively bruised, and very careful to give Jack as wide a berth as was compatible with the capabilities of the ship.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302313">'Curse you!' Jack shouted after him. 'I don't believe she would have you at any price!' And yet it puzzled him to guess why Dorothy had acted as she did.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302314">One week the regiment remained after landing at a place called Deolalee; and when they went forward to Unapore, they marched without Mr. Bryan Montagu, who returned to England by the next steamer. He had seen enough of India during those seven days, he said; but Jack Sinclair always felt, with a thrill of satisfaction, that he had something to do with his return. He had not forgotten the time, not far distant, when Bryan Montagu had talked of the delights of India with what was nothing short of rapture.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_084" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302315">THREE years passed away before Jack Sinclair returned to his native shores. He did so then because he had come into his inheritance; for his father had gone into that higher region Where such things as earthly riches and troubles have no place. But he died, blessing Jack at the last; and Jack had been sent for, reaching his home, alas! too late.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302317">And so he was no longer Jack Sinclair the dragoon, troubled with numerous debts and other difficulties, but Sinclair of Cleve, the owner of a good estate, the head of a good county family. It was perfectly astonishing how nice everyone seemed <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302316" n="220     CAVALRY LIFE"/>to find him. The self-same people who had looked very much askance at ' that dreadfully wild fellow, Jack Sinclair,' found out that, after all, young men will be young men, and that wild-oats are best sown. Some ladies even went so far as to affirm that the wildest young men make the best husbands. <hi rend="italic">Those</hi> were ladies with marriageable daughters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302318">But they angled and baited their traps for him in vain. Jack would have none of them. His mother remained the undisturbed mistress of Cleve, and his sisters declared he must have left his heart in India.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302319">Jack said, 'Exactly so'; and then they wondered why he hadn't married her. Effie suggested that perhaps she was married already; but the more strong-minded Laura scouted that idea altogether. She was sure Jack would not be such a fool as that. No; depend upon it, Jack did not feel altogether satisfied about her. Perhaps her family was not to his liking. That the lady might be unwilling never entered their heads. Was not Jack ' Sinclair of Cleve,' with seven thousand a year?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302320">However, their conjectures brought them no nearer to the truth, since Jack turned a deaf ear to all their hints, and invariably answered them with the same word, ' Exactly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302321">'You ought to marry,' Laura told him one day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302322">'Exactly,' said Jack easily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302323">'Then, why don't you?' she asked. 'I'm sure you're in love.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302324">'Exactly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302325">To say the least of it, the answer was discouraging.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302326">However, in love or out of it, Jack did not change his condition. He went about in the character of an eligible bachelor, and seemed to find the position a very pleasant one; at least, he certainly made no attempt to alter it. He had returned from India in the summer, and during the autumn and winter seemed as if he was trying to make up for the society he had missed dining his sojourn in the East. The family at Cleve saw but little of him until Christmas, when he remained at home a whole fortnight. At the end of that time he went northwards to pay a long-promised visit at the house of a man who had been in the Cuirassiers when he first joined the regiment. He had a long and cold journey, arriving about an hour before dinner. Major Holroyd went out to the door to meet him, with a thousand apologies for not having been at the station, three miles away.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302327" n="221     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302328">'The fact was, my bailiff came in just as I was starting; and as his business was urgent—roof of a cottage tumbled in, worse luck!—why, I was obliged to go round and make some arrangements for the family until it can be attended to,' he explained.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302329">'It really did not matter,' Jack answered. 'How is Mrs. Holroyd? Oh, there you are!' as he followed his host into the inner hall. 'How are you? And how's our old friend, Ethel?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302330">'Grown a monster,' Mrs. Holroyd laughed. 'You'll see her presently, no doubt. You'll have a cup of tea, Captain Sinclair? I remember your old weakness for it. I think you must know everyone here, excepting, perhaps, Lady Beaurivage.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302331">Jack turned from a young lady who was greeting him effusively with a great start. Yes, there she was—the one love of his life! No longer pale, no longer with that look of hunted pain in her great azure eyes, but calm, smiling, self-possessed; and sitting near to her was Bryan Montagu. Jack determined, as he held out his hand with a grave bow, that his visit at Lark's Nest would be cut short on the following day by a plea of 'urgent private affairs.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302332">'Then, you do know her?' Mrs. Holroyd cried, seeing the friendly, yet half-distant, salutation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302333">'I used to know Captain Sinclair,' answered Lady Beaurivage distinctly, 'very well indeed; but, for some reason or other, he cut me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302334">'Dead as a door-nail,' Montagu affirmed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302335">I cannot believe that,' cried Mrs. Holroyd emphatically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302336">It is quite true,' answered Lady Beaurivage calmly; 'ask him if it is not so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302337">'I won't ask you, Captain Sinclair, because I have too much faith in you to believe it,' said the hostess.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302338">'Unfortunately it is perfectly true,' Jack returned gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302339">'Why?' someone asked thoughtlessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302340">'Why?' he repeated. 'Oh, you must get Lady Beaurivage to tell you that!' at which the young Countess blushed so vividly crimson that everyone laughed; and Mrs. Holroyd, to spare her further confusion, made a move, and carried her off to dress.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302341">'Of course there's no truth in all that nonsense about your cutting her?' Major Holroyd asked, when he and Jack were left in possession of hall.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302342" n="222     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302343">'Oh yes; it's true enough,' Jack answered bitterly. 'If I'd known she was staying here, I shouldn't have come, and as it is, I think I had better leave you to-morrow.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302344">'But what on earth has she done?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302345">'It was just this way: Lady Beaurivage was engaged to me, and jilted me—for Montagu. That's the whole story Holroyd, and the less I see of her for the future, the better.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302346">'Then, why doesn't she marry Montagu?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302347">'Sure I don't know,' Jack returned forlornly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302348">'Because,' Major Holroyd continued,' he has been running after her for three years, to my certain knowledge. He worships the very ground she walks on, and she always <hi rend="italic">seems</hi> as if she detests him. To be sure, one never can tell what a woman is up to,' he ended;' but, at all events, Jack, I don't see that they need drive you away from us; you've done nothing to be ashamed of.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302349">'No, exactly,' Jack answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302350">'Then, you'll stay?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302351">'Yes, I'll stay,' holding out his hand and gripping his friend's firmly—a display of feeling of which he repented instantly, and marched off upstairs, wishing he hadn't made such a fool of himself. All the same, Major Holroyd, standing staring reflectively into the fire, did not consider he had made a fool of himself at all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302352">'Queer concern that,' he muttered. 'I'll keep an eye upon them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302353">So he did, but he learnt remarkably little. The intercourse between Lady Beaurivage and Mr. Montagu was exactly as it had been aforetime—abject worship on his part, persistent snubbing on hers. Jack Sinclair kept aloof from both of them, and spent most of his time with small Ethel, a child of ten, who had been a great pet of his in the old days, before he fell in love with Dorothy St. George, otherwise Lady Beaurivage—and time slipped on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302355">He came in one afternoon after a long day's hunting, tired and wet, having missed all the others and returned alone. Just as he reached the hall he saw Lady Beaurivage, with three of the children clinging about her, coming down the stairs, and as he never met her, if by any chance he could possibly avoid her, he slipped into the library, thinking they would be going on to the drawing-room. A moment later, however, the door of the library opened, and the four, not <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302354" n="223     THE LADY-KILLER-IN-CHIEF"/>seeing the red-coated figure in one of the deep window-seats, entered, and went to the other end of the room, where was the fireplace. His first impulse was to get up and go away, but he could not do that without speaking to Dorothy, and if he did so, Ethel would instantly entreat him to stay; therefore he remained where he was, almost hidden by the curtain, and listened patiently while Dorothy related a long fairy tale.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302356">'And then they were married, and lived happily ever after,' said the soft voice tenderly, bringing the story to an abrupt termination.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302357">'Well, and what then?' Dick asked eagerly; 'what then, Dolly?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302358">'Oh, nothing more than that,' she answered with a soft laugh; 'what more would you have?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302359">'People are always happy when they get married,' put in Ethel wisely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302360">'Who told you that?' Dorothy laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302361">'Captain Sinclair said so, because this morning I told him Jinks was going to be married, and he said "Happy Jinks!" Would you like to be married, Dolly?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302362">'It would quite depend,' Dorothy said guardedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302363">'If it was Mr. Montagu?' Ethel suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302364">'Oh no, not at all!'—very emphatically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302365">'If it was Captain Sinclair? He's very nice, you know, Dolly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302366">'Is he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302367">'I like Captain Sinclair best of anyone I know,' Ethel returned critically; 'and he's got the prettiest dressing-case I ever saw. And he's going to buy me a watch and chain when he goes back to town—a real one, you know; so, Dick, you may have the old one mother's keeping for me. I say, Dolly, if it was Captain Sinclair?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302368">Captain Sinclair would not have me,' said Lady Beaurivage, With what sounded to Jack like a sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302369">'I'll ask him, if you like,' Ethel cried obligingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302370">'No, thank you'—with a genuine laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302371">'Tell us another story, Dolly, do,' put in Jim imploringly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302372">'Do you know that the bell has rung for the nursery tea?' Lady Beaurivage asked; 'and that you were promised some honey?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302373">'I forgot. Come, Dick, Ethel, let us be off;' and away the three youngsters scampered, leaving the library to the other two occupants.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302374" n="224     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302375">'And so they got married and lived happily ever after' said one of them, moving forward into the firelight.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302376">Lady Beaurivage started violently and jumped up from her seat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302377">'I did not know you were there,' she exclaimed confusedly, wondering anxiously if he had heard what Ethel said about himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302378">'My little friend Ethel,' he said coolly, 'asked you if you would like to marry Montagu, and you said, "Oh no, not at all!" If it is not too impertinent, may I ask why you did not give the same reply when she asked you another question?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302379">Lady Beaurivage remained silent, and Jack continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302380">'Would not the same reply have done? And how is it you have not married Montagu?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302381">'Ugh!' cried Lady Beaurivage without much dignity, but with a very large amount of expression, at which Jack laughed out aloud. It might be that the laugh gave her courage, but certain it is that she put out her two pretty hands with an imploring gesture and faltered, 'Don't be cross with me any more, Jack.' She seemed to have parted with her dignity altogether.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302382">A heart of adamant must have melted before those azure eyes shining through a mist of tears, and Jack's heart was not of an adamantine quality, so far as Dorothy was concerned; and so, somehow, his arms found their way round her, and the golden head was pillowed on his breast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302383">'What did you do it for?' he asked after a while, without much regard for grammar.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302384">And then she told him of the conversation she overheard, and how she had determined to pay the Lady-Killer out in his own coin, never considering that Jack would object.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302385">'And I thought afterwards,' she stammered, 'that perhaps you only wanted an excuse to get out of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302386">'Oh, my darling!'

Hey? What a—what a——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302406">'D——d bore,' finished the baby in a tone of quiet indifference, which showed he was ignorant of the signification of the words. Then, interrupting his father's proud, noisy mirth, 'I say, father, mother took me to church to-day, and I saw'—dropping his voice and speaking very impressively—'I saw—<hi rend="italic">the Devil!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302407">'Eh? Bless my soul! WHAT!' exclaimed the Major, jumping almost out of his chair.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302408">'Now you see the result of your teaching,' put in Mrs. Sabretasche in a tone of desperate resignation; 'it was old Sir George's monument that we went in to see.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302409">'Ha! ha! ha!' laughed the Major uproariously; 'the boy's not so far out of it, after all. Old George Leroy was as nearly akin to the old gentleman as human beings ever go. Bless the lad! he's a real Sabretasche—a chip of the old block; bless me! and only five years old.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302410">'And father,' Bob continued, climbing on to the Major's knee and sitting with one hand squared on his hip, like a dragoon on horseback, 'Tom Leslie put his tongue out at me this morning and said I was a molly-coddle. I'm not a mollycoddle, now, am I?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302411">'That depends upon what you said to him,' answered the Major gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302412">'Well,' said small Bob with a long sigh, 'I said I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> be a molly-coddle, but if he called me so again, I'd just punch his head.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302413">'Quite right, too,' remarked the Major with infinite satisfaction, and looking as stern as his pride and laughter would permit.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302414">'Such a volley of abuse Bob poured out,' complained Mrs. Sabretasche; 'I would have given him a good whipping, only it's no use beating the child for your fault—and it is your fault, Major.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302415" n="227     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302416">'Now, look here, Maria,' said the Major with much decision: 'a soldier's one thing and a parson's another. If you wished for a parson, you should have married a parson, but you didn't; you married a Sabretasche, of whom you must just make the best, and, what is more, you must not grumble if my boy takes after me; it's only natural that he should. The Sabretasches have always been soldiers; they take to the army as young ducks to water, and I won't have the Sabretasche traits of character knocked out of him; you must simply make the best of us both.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302417">That was the principle upon which young Bob's education was completed; the result of that education I will relate in the pages which follow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302418">Young Bob went through the usual course of training which boys of his class undergo. From the hands of a tutor to Eton, and from Eton to Sandhurst, at which place he lost a year's seniority for insubordination or some such misdemeanour. He received the news with characteristic coolness—characteristic of both parents, for it combined his mother's quiet calmness with his father's spirit of don't-carish dare-devilism; that is to say, he touched his cap when the decision of the powers-that-be was communicated to him, said, 'Very well, sir,' and went out of the awful presence—and laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302419">'What will your governor say?' a friend asked him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302420">'Say? That they're a set of thick-headed old idiots,' answered Bob, laughing yet more. 'Just the way they served him—so he can't say anything to me if he feels inclined.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302421">However, when Bob went home, with two months' leave and a commission as sub-lieutenant in that most distinguished regiment, the Scarlet Lancers, old Sabretasche was far too proud of him to cavil at so trivial a matter as the loss of a year's seniority. He superintended all the details of Bob's outfit with a delight only to be equalled by that of a bride selecting her trousseau. He coached him in all the etiquette of the mess-room—no small task that—and on parting he gave one piece of advice—one only.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302422">'Now, look here, Bob,' he said, as they were driving through the green lanes on their way to the station, 'there's one thing I should like to say to you before you go.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302423">'All right,' said Bob cheerfully, flicking at the flies as he spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302425">'I lay no restrictions upon you,' said the gallant old Major <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302424" n="228     CAVALRY LIFE"/>rather wistfully; 'I never have done; I don't think I have ever bullied you in any way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302426">''Deed, no,' returned Bob readily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302427">'And I should like to feel that I can trust to your honour never to play a woman false. It's a wrong once done, Bob, that you never get over as long as you live; a remembrance of that kind comes back to you years after you'd fain forget all about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302428">Bob looked down from his high driving-seat a little curiously at the handsome, flushed old face, which his own so strongly resembled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302429">'I say, father,' he remarked at last, 'are you speaking from experience?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302430">'Perhaps I am,' he admitted, 'but take my advice about it, Bob.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302431">'I think I will,' said Bob quietly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302432">Not another word was spoken between them till they reached the little country station, whence Bob departed for Colchester, where his regiment was quartered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302433">'Good-bye, Bob, my boy—bless you!' cried the Major rather huskily, as the train started.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302434">'Dear old chap!' murmured Bob, as he lit a cigar and put his feet on the opposite seat. 'By Jove! though, who'd have thought he had ever gone in for the character of a gay Lothario?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302435">Arrived at Colchester, Bob betook himself and his belongings in a fly to the barracks, drawing up in front of the mess with considerable clatter and dash—taking into account that after all it was only a fly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302436">He jumped out, and addressed himself to one of two officers in undress uniform who were standing in the doorway.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302437">'Er—good—morning,' said Bob, in no wise abashed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302438">'Good-morning,' said the taller of the twain with civility.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302439">'I suppose you are officers of the Scarlet Lancers,' Bob remarked blandly. 'My name is Sbretasche-er——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302440">'Oh, Sabretasche-<hi rend="italic">er</hi>, is it?' interrupted the officer, with an amused smile. 'Well, Mr. Sabretasche-<hi rend="italic">er</hi>, I suppose you've come to join?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302441">'Exactly-er,' returned Bob easily. 'Where shall I find my quarters? and can I report myself to the Colonel at once?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302442">'Well, as I happen to be the Colonel, you can,' said his new friend, smiling, while the shorter man laughed outright.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302443" n="229     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302444">Bob was, however, thoroughly equal to the occasion, awkward as it was. He took off his hat, displaying a handsome curly head, and said with the utmost gravity, as if he had not spoken before: 'I have the honour to present myself, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302445">'As for quarters,' the Colonel continued, 'this is Mr. Smithers, the Quartermaster.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302446">Taking this as an introduction, Bob looked at the Quartermaster, and said, 'How do?' with a nod of the curtest description.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302447">Just at that moment two other officers appeared round the corner, to whom Colonel Keith introduced the new arrival.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302448">'And, Wingfield,' he said to the younger of them, 'just look after Mr. Sabretasche to-day, and put him in the way of things generally.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302449">'Certainly, sir,' answered Wingfield.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302450">He entered the cab with Bob, and drove off to the quarters allotted to him. The Colonel stood where they left him, looking after the retreating vehicle.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302451">'I've no doubt he'll make a smart soldier,' he remarked, when he had watched it quite out of sight, 'but he'll want a good deal of his d——d cheek taken out of him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302452">Notwithstanding that such was the opinion of their commanding officer, the Scarlet Lancers did not find Bob Sabretache's 'cheek' so very easy to eradicate. He had been too well coached by his old father to make any mistakes in his intercourse with his senior officers—the respectful 'sir' with which he addressed his Colonel or Major, the quiet air of deference with which he received their opinions when they were contrary to his own, at the same time sticking resolutely to his original sentiments—all were faultless, and the senior sub had no occasion to polish off Bob's education on that point. He submitted to be drawn with imperturbable good nature—in fact, so good that they soon found there was no fun in disturbing him, for was he not always as ready for a midnight frolic as they were? He was thoroughly well up in mess-room etiquette, and was never to be caught tripping in those little matters which necessitate the imposition of a fine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302453">And so the first terrible months—or what are usually so—passed over for Bob Sabretasche very easily; and then he was summoned home by a telegram, telling him that the large, handsome, serene woman who had been so placidly careful of his morals was dead, and his father left alone.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302454" n="230     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302455">Bob took the news badly. In all his twenty years of life, he had never had such a blow as that. In truth, he had never had a blow of any kind except in the matter of that year of seniority, which he had taken as a joke. When the telegram arrived he was at lunch. He happened to be sitting just opposite to the Colonel, and asked, by a look, if he might open it. The chief nodded, and Bob, under cover of the cloth, tore open the yellow wrapper.</p><q><l>'<hi rend="italic">Your mother died this morning; pray come</hi>.'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302456">For a moment Bob sat perfectly still; then, feeling his composure giving way, flung the telegram with etiquette to the winds, and rushed out of the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302457">'What's the matter?' asked the chief, as the door closed with a great crash.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302458">The man nearest to Bob's vacated place picked up the telegram and glanced at the brief sentences which conveyed so much.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302459">'His mother is dead, sir,' he said quietly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302460">'Ah!' murmured the superior comprehensively, with a sigh to the memory of a gentle woman who had passed away twenty years before. He continued speaking, but later he went up to Bob's room, and told him to get home as soon as possible. 'I'll arrange your leave,' he ended kindly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302461">And so Bob Sabretasche went home to the old house where lie had lived and been happy, but, alas! in which he would live and be happy never more. That telegram was but the beginning of the end. The death of the fair, placid woman whom he had loved broke the old soldier down utterly, and within six months Bob found himself alone in the world, with no near relatives, but one-and-twenty years of age, and with a fortune of as many thousand pounds entirely at his own disposal.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302462">Just at first he was too much stunned by his double loss to do anything more than his duty. He did do that in a dull, mechanical way which presently put him on the sick-list, and gave the doctor no small amount of trouble; and then Time, the comforter—who does such wonders for all of us—took him in hand, and smoothed the harsh lines of his sorrow into the more tender lineaments of a loving recollection, so that by the time the regiment moved its quarters to Liliminster he was able to enter with great zest into all sporting pursuits, and found a good deal of enjoyment in the pleasures of society.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302463" n="231     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302464">The better to cultivate both, Bob set up a stud of fourteen hunters, likewise the smartest Stanhope phaeton which could possibly be procured; for that he had two high-stepping chestnut cobs, which, with a couple of chargers, brought the total number of his stud up to eighteen—and, be it remembered, his income was about a thousand a year. For a year or so he certainly went the pace. Quoth one of his friends to him one day:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302465">'I don't know what your income is, Bob, but if it is anything under eight thousand a year, you must be a fool.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302466">'Income be bothered!' returned Bob carelessly. 'Come round and look at my coach—it's a clipper, out and out the smartest I have seen for ever so long.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302467">Yes, the crowning-point of Bob Sabretasche's folly was to set up a coach and team of his own. He threw his money right and left like water—water which cost him nothing—and at three-and-twenty had managed to get so nearly through his one-and-twenty thousand pounds that he pulled himself up sharp one fine morning and wondered what the deuce would be the end of it all!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302468">His sudden awakening came in this wise: A few days before he had received an intimation from his bankers to the effect that his account was overdrawn. He at once telegraphed to his lawyer for money, and from that acute gentleman had by return of post a letter suggesting, since his patrimony was reduced to five thousand pounds, the advisability of not further lessening it. Bob awoke from his course of reckless extravagance like a somnambulist suddenly recalled to consciousness. Since his father's death he had never given money matters a thought. He had been terribly cut up by the loss of his parents so near together, and had taken to spending money more for something to do than from any other cause. He had fancied it would be very jolly to have fourteen hunters, a coach and team, and the cleverest cobs in the service, but how those luxuries were to be paid for had simply never occurred to him. Had he not from earliest childhood been accustomed to have anything or everything for which he felt the smallest inclination?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302470">He sat, with the lawyer's letter in his hand, for a long, long time, looking thoughtfully into the fire. Well, he had gone the pace; there was no doubt about that. It had been great fun whilst it lasted, but, after all, he didn't know that he was <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302469" n="232     CAVALRY LIFE"/>not growing rather tired of it all. This continual visiting, the dodging of gracious mammas with young and lovely daughters and daughters also neither young nor lovely. How they had tracked him down, to be sure! He glanced up at the dozens of pressing invitations for the month to come which were lying about the chimney-piece, and, in spite of his suddenly sobered senses, burst into a fit of hearty laughter at the thought of the time and pains which had been taken, and wasted, in trying to hook him—really wasted: for was he not, after all, of the worst class of detrimentals—a poor man with expensive tastes? The laughter soon ceased as the stern reality came back to him again with tenfold vigour.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302471">'By George! what a fool I have been!' he said emphatically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302472">Still, it was no use crying over spilt milk; no man can eat his cake and have it. Bob had undoubtedly partaken very greedily of his. As he sat there in the twilight of that cold March day, with the red fireglow playing over his handsome face—from out of which all the carelessness and fun had been driven—two or three lines came into his mind, lines which he had read ever so long ago, when he had been young—Bob felt that he had grown awfully old since then; when he had not taken to squandering money like an idiot or a cotton-spinning cad—as he told himself wrathfully; when he had had a dear, good, gallant old father, to whom he could have carried all his troubles and had kindly advice. Yes, it was in those far-away, happy days, which were never to return again, that he had read them, little dreaming how soon the time would come when they would be applicable to himself: 'Fools climb to fall: fond hopes, like seeled doves for want of better light, mount, till they end their flight with falling.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302473">'And—oh, Lord!' Bob groaned, 'I have been a confounded idiot, and serve me right to come such a cropper!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302475">And then he roused himself with a mental shake, and looked round the pretty room. It was pretty, in spite of the take-to-piece-able barrack room furniture. The walls were hung with pictures from cornice to dado; yes, Bob had the room decorated in that style. There were velvet-hung brackets; a superb flounce of lace, worked by the hand of some fair lady, adorned the chimney-valance; there were hothouse flowers and rare old china in profusion, so that the whole was tasteful and pretty. Well, he thought with a sigh, there would not surely be any need to disturb that. The little trifles had cost <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302474" n="233     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/>a good deal, to be sure, but if sold they would fetch very little, and he did not exactly wish all his brother officers to know how deeply he was dipped; therefore he concluded to let the room remain untouched. He got a bit of paper, and jotted down what he had left out of the wreck of his fortune:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302476">£5,000—capital.</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302477">Well, that wasn't so bad to begin with, he thought, with an attempt—a very poor one, too—at self-comfort. Five thousand pounds! Why, it was only the other day that he met a man—a cotton-spinning fellow—at Lord Agate's, who had given as many guineas for a necklace for his daughter, and thought nothing of it; and now that sum was all Bob had in the world, except what he might be able to realize from the sale of his horses and so on. Queer little thing that same daughter was—little, slim, rather ugly thing, with a wide mouth, very soft eyes, and no shape to speak of.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302478">'I believe she was spooney on me,' Bob said aloud to the walls, or his reflection in the glass, maybe; 'yes, sir, sure she was, and she was engaged to a fat, vulgar old brute, thirty years older than herself, she told me. Poor little soul! Queer sort of taste, though, he must have. Lord! I wouldn't have kissed her for a thousand pounds.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302479">But it was no use thinking about Lily Ray or Lily anybody else. So he returned anew to his calculation as to what he might reasonably expect his horses to bring him. Bob didn't quite know whether fourteen hunters were not too many for any man; it was hard work to keep them all fit. Fourteen hunters—put 'em at a hundred apiece. Very few of them were of less value than that, whilst most of them were worth a good deal more. If they fetched a little more, the difference would pay off any little debts that might be standing. We must do Bob the justice to say that he had no debts to speak of. 'Well, then:</p><q><table cols="2" rows="4"><row role="data"><cell>'Capital</cell><cell>£5,000</cell></row><row role="data"><cell>Hunters</cell><cell>£1,400</cell></row><row role="data"><cell>Coach</cell><cell>£150</cell></row><row role="data"><cell>Team</cell><cell>£400'</cell></row></table></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302481">The coach cost three hundred guineas,' Bob thought ruefully, 'and I've only had it a few months; it ought to fetch a hundred and fifty; I'll put it at that. The team is worth six hundred—every penny of it—but I suppose I shall have to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302480" n="234     CAVALRY LIFE"/>throw them away at four. Oh—h, Lord! but this is a bad business.

I suppose the phaeton and the cobs must go, though I did hope to be able to keep one of them, at least.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302485">He sat working out this unpleasant problem for a long, long time, without much success, and then, somehow, his mind wandered off to Lily Ray and her five-thousand-guinea necklace. What a little ugly thing she was! At least, perhaps not exactly ugly, but she'd a very wide mouth, and no shape at all. She was, somehow, <hi rend="italic">unkissable</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302486">'Now, Jinks, what is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302487">'Well, sir, it's a lady,' returned the man, holding the door in his hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302488">'A lady! Oh, the devil! Tell her I'm out,' Bob answered shortly; he did not want troubling with any ladies just then.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302489">The man departed, closing the door after him, and Bob thought to hear no more of his visitor, but a moment later a querulous, imperious voice rang through the corridor, which caused Bob to spring from his seat in double-quick time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302490">'Which are Mr. Sabretasche's rooms? Show me at once. I will wait until he comes in,' it said.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302491">Bob flung his door open, and a tiny creature, robed in rich furs and closely veiled, stepped out of the darkness into the circle of light cast by the fire. In the background stood Jinks in silent amazement; perhaps he doubted for a moment if the small creature might be a fairy or not, only the ordinary cavalry soldier is not a speculative animal, but as his master shut the door in his face, he concluded that all was right, and departed about his business.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302492" n="235     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302493">As the door closed, the visitor tore her veil aside, and flung—literally flung—herself into the astonished Bob's arms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302494">'My dear Miss Ray,' he gasped, 'what does this mean?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302495">'Dear, darling Bob!' cried the poor little person, clinging to him convulsively, 'they've been so cruel to me—oh, so cruel to me! Look'—pulling back the furs from her small wrists and displaying the white skin all bruised and livid. The sight elicited a cry of horror from Bob, and an ugly sharp word from between his teeth. 'Oh, I hated him so—I couldn't marry him!' Lily went on, with a great shuddering horror in her tones and in her soft eyes—the eyes were really pretty, if nothing else was—'and papa said he would <hi rend="italic">make</hi> me love him; but he could not'—triumphantly—'for I love—you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302496">'But you don't mean to say he used personal violence towards you?' Bob cried aghast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302497">'I'm black and blue all over,' she answered confidently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302498">'Low beast!' cried Bob with emphasis.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302499">'Just what I told him,' remarked Miss Ray with a long sigh. 'However, it doesn't matter; I'm all safe with you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302500">Poor Bob trembled in his shoes. Did this little body expect him to <hi rend="italic">marry</hi> her? Bob was absolutely sick at the bare idea of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302501">'What made you think of coming to me?' he said abruptly. The soft eyes turned upon him in reproachful surprise. Why, have you forgotten your promise?' she asked with quivering lips.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302502">'Did I promise you anything?' he said tenderly, for, after all, if he did not admire her, she was a woman, and he was mindful of those cruel bruises. 'What was it that I promised?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302503">'Oh,' cried the poor child with a sob of terror—she was but seventeen—'you promised me, if ever I needed a friend, I might come to you and trust you to take care of me. Don't you remember? It was the night of the ball at Lord Agate's. You <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> have forgotten it,' she ended with a wail of despair.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302504">'To be sure not—certainly not,' he said soothingly, though he had no recollection of it whatever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302506">'I don't believe you even remember it,' she said sorrowfully; 'you <hi rend="italic">said</hi> you liked me, and I believed you, but, after all you don't want me, and if I go back they will kill me. Oh, they will kill me!'—shrinking back with every appearance of terror. 'So cruel they were; how they hurt me! I didn't care so much then. I thought I could get away to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302505" n="236     CAVALRY LIFE"/>you and be safe; but you did not mean it at all, and you don't want me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302507">For a moment Bob stood irresolute, trying to think. He looked at the swollen, bruised wrists of this poor little soul, who had flown to him for protection, relying on his promise. Then a sudden recollection came over him of the day when he joined his regiment: how he had driven his father to the station, and the dear, gallant old man had asked him—the only favour he ever remembered him asking—never to play a woman false. In that brief moment of reflection he remembered that he had squandered his father's fortune—that his father was dead! Should he, then, fail to keep his promise to his dead father the very first time he was tried? Assuredly not. If his whole life was to be sacrificed, it would only be a slight reparation to the gallantmemory he had so soon forgotten.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302508">'You may trust me to take care of you, Lily,' he said kindly, bending down and laying his hand on her shoulder. She flinched from the touch, gentle as it was, thereby forcing another oath from between Bob's teeth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302509">'Good heavens, child!' he cried, passionately incredulous, 'you don't mean to say that they really struck you?—that you cannot bear to be touched?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302510">'I dare say it will soon go off', she said, trying to be brave, though the tears were stealing down her cheeks; 'and—and you won't send me back?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302511">' On my word—no,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302512">And then he turned to the fire, trying once more to <hi rend="italic">think</hi>—to realize his position. He was not at all sure, since Lily was only seventeen, that he could marry her legally without the consent of her father; of course, he would have to marry her, and equally of course, Mr. Ray would not consent. Then, again, what the deuce were they to live upon? Three-fifty a year and his pay? It was absurd! He sat down on the sofa beside her, and took her hand in his-very carefully this time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302513">'Do you know, Lily, that I am a poor man?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302514">'Really? I thought you were very well off,' she said placidly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302515">'But I am not, indeed. I have been very reckless and extravagant since my father died, and I have only about four hundred a year left.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302516">'Ah! I am so tired of being rich,' she cried gladly; 'it will be ever so much nicer to be poor; you don't know.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302517" n="237     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302518">'I don't, indeed,' said Bob doubtfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302519">'I've ever so much money with me,' Lily went on, producing her purse. 'I wish you would take care of it, please; I might have it stolen; and, Bob dear, will you go and pay the cabman, and tell him to bring my luggage up here?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302520">'Your luggage!' Bob gasped; 'my poor child, you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> stop here. Don't you know that this is a barrack?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302521">'To be sure; I told the man to drive here,' she said innocently; 'why, soldiers always live in a barrack, don't they?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302522">Bob fairly groaned aloud; however, he went and paid the man, and had the luggage—a goodly pile of it—taken upstairs.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302523">'How did you manage to get off?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302524">'Papa went to London with—<hi rend="italic">him</hi> to get a special license,' she said simply; 'so I packed up all I thought I should want and—<hi rend="italic">me violà</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302525">'And when does he return?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302526">'Not until to-morrow morning '—clapping her hands gaily—'when he will find me—gone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302527">'Well, I must be "gone," too, to make some arrangements for your accommodation,' Bob said ruefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302528">'But you will come back?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302529">'Oh yes—in a few minutes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302530">He went hastily to the Colonel's house, and knocked at the door of his sitting-room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302531">'Are you busy, sir?' he asked as he entered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302532">Colonel Keith looked up from his writing. 'Oh, is it you, Sabretasche? Yes, I am rather busy; what is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302533">'I've got into a terrible mess, sir,' Bob said wistfully; 'but perhaps the Major will help me, if you are too busy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302534">'No, no, sit down and tell me all about it,' the chief replied. He made a rule of always encouraging the confidences of his subalterns, whenever he could. So Bob sat down and told him all about it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302535">'What had I better do, sir?' he ended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302536">'Do you say the girl is here?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302537">'Up in my room, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302538">'She can't stop there—that's very certain,' said the chief hurriedly;
 ' we'd better see if Mrs. Wilson will take charge of her.' Mrs. Wilson was the Adjutant's wife, and lived in the upper part of the Colonel's house. ' You see, Sabretasche, I can't help you in this matter, as I'm not a married man; if I had been, I would have taken her home at once.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302539" n="238     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302540">'You are very good, sir,' Bob said gratefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302541">'It's a very unpleasant business to be mixed up with,' he went on; 'you see, if the father chooses to be awkward, he can withhold his consent altogether.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302542">'Exactly! That is what I thought,' said Bob.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302543">'And you say they have positively beaten the child?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302544">'Her wrists are as black as my coat, sir,' Bob returned indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302545">'And I suppose you've been in love with her all along?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302546">'In love with her!' Bob echoed. 'Oh dear no! The fact is, she has come to me, relying on a foolish promise, made in jest, from which, of course, I cannot go back now. Well, sir, I'll go round and see what I can do with Mrs. Wilson.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302547">'I'll come with you,' said Colonel Keith kindly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302548">The Adjutant's tender-hearted little wife did not, however, wait to hear the whole of Bob's story, but rushed impulsively to his room, and did not so much as wait to put on her bonnet. A few minutes later Lily found herself by her new friend's fire, her feet on a stool, a cup of tea in her hand, her adoring eyes fixed on Bob's face, and her ears filled with the muttered exclamations of half a dozen stalwart officers, who had already heard the story, and were one and all ready to pay Mr. Ray and—<hi rend="italic">him</hi> back in their own coin with ample interest. Poor little Lily had never been made so much of during all her seventeen years of life: to her it was all delightful. The tall and, for the most part, good-looking officers in their handsome mess dress, the kindly affectionate hostess, and her lover, Bob. Oh, it was like Fairyland to her! She gave no thought to the future, she had almost forgotten the past, and so little did she look below the surface of the present that she never noticed how sorely troubled Bob was. How was she to know that his very soul was sick at the thought of his marriage, while his poor brain was puzzling over the miserable question, how were they to live on four hundred a year? If she had known precisely what was passing in his mind, she could scarcely have understood his feelings—she loved him. She had never looked at the other side of the question. As for money, she had always had so much of it that poverty was only a name to her: she knew nothing of its stings. For the present she was exalted into a heroine, and the worship she received was very pleasant to her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302550">The following day Colonel Keith and Bob went over to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302549" n="239     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/>Weystone Hall, Mr. Ray's residence. They found him at home, and apparently in that state of calm which invariably succeeds a storm. He was a little, burly, ill-tempered-looking man, evidently standing in much awe of the stern-looking gentleman commanding the Scarlet Lancers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302551">Colonel Keith stated his business in a clear and concise manner, ending by <hi rend="italic">demanding</hi>—not asking—for a written consent to his daughter's marriage with Mr. Robert Sabretasche.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302552">'I'll never speak to the hussy again!' roared the irate father, breaking into a passion once more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302553">'Will you have the goodness to sign this paper?' asked the Colonel calmly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302554">'She's no daughter of mine, sir,' screamed Ray père.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302555">'The law, however, rules otherwise,' answered the Colonel, with provoking coolness; 'will you sign it or not? If not, we shall procure a summons immediately for assault and battery.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302556">'Sign it, yes, and be glad to be rid of her!' Ray roared; 'only, young gentleman, don't think as 'ow you're going to get any of my money '—in his excitement long—disused terms cropped up again—'you've played fast and loose with me, and the girls all you'll get.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302557">Bob turned his nose skywards in huge contempt, but kept silent: he had immense faith in his chiefs conversational powers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302558">'Now, sir,' said Colonel Keith, when he had put the signed and witnessed paper carefully into his pocket-book and buttoned his coat over it, 'let me tell you, sir, that you are, without exception, the most scoundrelly, cowardly cad I ever spoke to or ever heard of in my whole life. You say <hi rend="italic">you</hi> disown your daughter, but if ever she speaks to you again she'll be a confounded fool—there, sir!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302559">After which the pair stalked out of the house, leaving the astonished owner literally beside himself with rage and fury.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302560">'Sabretasche,' said the chief when they were in the train again, 'we've done that fellow in the eye; I've not only got a written consent to the marriage, but also resigning all claim to any personal property, money or jewellery which Miss Ray may have taken away with her—properly witnessed, too.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302561">'It really is awfully good of you, Colonel,' said Bob, even in the moment of victory unable to repress a sigh.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302562" n="240     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302563">'I'm sorry, though, that you don't think more about her poor little thing!' he continued.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302564">All the chivalry in Bob's nature rose up at the words. 'Oh! it's all right, sir,' he said hastily; 'I shall not ill-use her;' at which assertion Colonel Keith laughed heartily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302565">A fortnight followed, during which Lily Ray remained as the guest of the Adjutant's wife, and Bob contrived to make arrangements for disposing of his horses and setting his affairs somewhat in order. The hardest pang of all was parting with the cobs, but they had to go—happily for Bob's peace of mind, not much under their proper value.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302566">On the whole, his 'effects' realized more than he had expected, so that he was able to pay just over three thousand pounds into his bankers' hands. His small <hi rend="italic">fiancée</hi>, having had this step in view for some months, had spent very little and saved the pocket-money her wealthy father had lavished upon her. Thus, they had nearly three hundred pounds between them to go on with, which, considering the doleful condition of their joint circumstances, was not so bad. Still, how to keep a wife on five hundred a-year was an unsolvable problem to the man who had been living at the rate of some seven thousand a-year.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302567">'I don't know how we shall manage it, Lily,' he said the day before the wedding.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302568">'Manage what?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302569">'Why, <hi rend="italic">living</hi>, of course; we shall only have about five hundred a-year, all told,' he answered gloomily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302570">The poor child slid down upon her knees before him. 'Am I a great bother to you?' she asked wistfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302571">If worried and unwilling, Bob was still a gentleman, and kind of heart. 'No, no, child,' he said hastily;' only we must live somehow, and neither of us has tried pinching before.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302572">'I shall not want any clothes for an age,' she said confidently. 'I've been expecting something of this sort—though I didn't know you were so poor—so I bought a few silk dresses. I have them at the bottom of one of my boxes—not made up, you know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302573">'Oh, but I don't know that dresses cost so much,' said Bob carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302574">'Oh, but they do, indeed—a lot! That jacket cost a hundred guineas'—pointing to her sables lying on the sofa; 'but, of course, it will not last a lifetime.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302575" n="241     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302576">'Well, but, Lily—it is servants, and housekeeping, and all that,' he said in a perplexed tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302577">'Oh, do you want many servants?—they're such a nuisance—poking and prying into everything one does, and counting the mouthfuls one eats—I hate them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302578">Bob shivered; he did not hate servants.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302579">'And you know, Bob dear, there are my jewels. We can sell them. I don't care for them. I shall love your two rings better than all the diamonds on earth.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302580">'Oh, we can't sell your jewellery—besides, it won't be worth much,' Bob answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302581">'Not worth much!' she echoed. 'Ten thousand pounds, if a penny. Why, my necklace cost five thousand guineas.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302582">'But you don't mean to say you brought <hi rend="italic">that</hi> away with you?' Bob cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302583">'Do you suppose I left it behind?' Lily asked, opening her eyes very wide.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302584">'Why, bless me! what a clever little soul you are!' he said with
a laugh. 'Who's that? Oh, is it you, Colonel? Come in, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302585">'I say, Colonel,' he said after a while, 'did you not tell me
that you made some arrangement with Mr. Ray as to his
daughter's belongings?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302586">'Certainly; he signed a paper, giving up all claim to any personal property, money or jewellery she may have taken away with her. Why, is there likely to be any trouble?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302587">Bob burst out laughing. 'She has brought all her jewellery with her,' he answered; 'that is all, but it may make a great difference to us;' for he had made a clean breast of his misfortunes to the Colonel long before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302589">Nevertheless, they had hard work to make both ends meet. Bob, at three-and-twenty, and Lily, but seventeen, knew as much about housekeeping as did the babes in the wood—ergo, they were not a little imposed upon. Then, on the other hand, Bob could never allow himself the luxury of a growl, for, as surely as he began, the tears welled up into Mrs. Bob's eyes, and she immediately went in for the luxury of a good cry. Bob, like a good many other men, hated a scene, and tears invariably acted upon him as does a red rag to a bull; so he came to the conclusion that his best plan was to abstain from growling. On that score, matters went rather more smoothly, but there were other scores upon which they persistently declined to go smoothly at all. Lily <hi rend="italic">would</hi> make a practice of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302588" n="242     CAVALRY LIFE"/>spooning him. Poor Bob! He had never got over his first feeling that Miss Ray was <hi rend="italic">unkissable</hi>, and now that she was transformed into Mrs. Bob Sabretasche, he did not find his original opinion altered. But that was not the worst of it. Mrs. Bob made a rule of being more openly demonstrative in public than in private. She liked, poor little soul! to make a display of her affection for her handsome stalwart husband; to sit with her hand in his; to call him by all manner of absurd and endearing names, regardless of the presence of his brother officers, who one and all treated him to a volley of nursery names and spooney terms, whenever he ventured to show his face in the anteroom.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302590">'Now, "Bobbie-wobbie,"' the first would cry, 'come and sit next to me, "Duckie-wuckie."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302591">Whereupon Bob would shut the door with a crash, and betake himself back to his mismanaged home, to endure the same from Lily, only with the difference that poor little plain Lily was most thoroughly in earnest. Poor Bob! the great change in his life told upon him frightfully—the brightness faded from his eyes; the soldierly, swaggering gait grew quiet and preoccupied; the smartness in his person vanished: and the officers of the Scarlet Lancers one and all agreed that poor old Bob really had gone off woefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302592">And then a new trouble came upon them. In spite of her childish ways, little Mrs. Bob, as they called her, was a great favourite with the whole regiment. Most of them remembered the poor little bruised and swollen wrists, and admired her for the pluck she had shown in cutting the home lot and flying for succour to the man whom she loved. To the officers' wives she was so good-natured and gentle that they, too, admitted her into high favour, and thus it happened that by-and-by she began to notice the behaviour of other men towards their wives. It was an eventful day for both of them when Mrs. Bob's eyes were thus opened. She perceived that Bob, though long-suffering and courteous, never made love to her, and although there are many, many wives who would prize those two desirable qualities before a little love-making and a lot of bullying (is not that the usual mixture?), Mrs. Bob began to pine for that which was denied her. She cared nothing for courtesy, less for long-suffering, and she did crave for Bob's love. She one day, in a burst of confidence, said as much to one of the married ladies.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302593" n="243     THE SAD HISTORY OF BOB SABRETASCHE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302594">'My dear Mrs. Bob,' said she kindly, 'you should never judge one man by another, they show their affection so differently; and, I assure you, Mr. Sabretasche never was of an effusive nature. I never knew him flirt with anyone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302595">But the little woman remained unconvinced, and immediately adopted a new demeanour towards her lord and master. She ceased all the little caresses and endearing terms which had so <hi rend="italic">worried</hi> him, but which, with the usual contrariety of poor human nature, he somehow missed. He looked at her as she ate her dinner in silence, and wondered if she were ' seedy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302596">' Oh, Lily, the Colonel's coming down to dine to-morrow; there's something on at the theatre, so we'll have dinner at seven,' he remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302597">' Very well,' said Lily quietly, and without lifting her eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302598">Then, not a little to his astonishment, instead of bringing her dessert plate round to his side, she left the room without speaking. Not that Bob minded that much; but it was rather stupid alone, and an awful bore having to pick his own walnuts. Lily certainly was an indefatigable walnut-peeler; there was no doubt about that. Ugh!—he flung the unoffending nutcrackers down with a crash, and broke a plate in so doing, which brought him to himself again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302599">' Queer thing to go off like that,' he mused; ' she's such a good-tempered little thing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302600">It never occurred to him that the trodden worm will turn at last. This poor fragile little worm, upon whom he had been treading so ruthlessly for months, had turned at last, and Bob did not like it. He felt as if some soft little bird had suddenly repaid his caresses by trying to peck his eyes out. Well, no, he admitted, not <hi rend="italic">caresses</hi>; he could not shut his eyes to that fact.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302601">However, it was no use sitting looking at that broken plate all night, so he roused himself, and went into the drawing-room. His wife was sitting in a huge chair, with a novel in her hand. She never looked up when he entered, and did not, as was her wont, fly to fill his pipe—bless you, no, she did not mind smoking!—to give him a light, to fold his paper just where he wanted to read, or to do the hundred and one things in the doing of which she had made a veritable slave of herself. Bob felt himself personally aggrieved. No sooner was he settled in his chair than he discovered that his tobacco-pot was missing.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302602" n="244     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302603">'Do you know where my tobacco is, Lily?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302604">'I believe it's on the dining-room chimney-piece,' she answered indifferently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302605">Bob fetched it with a groan—an inward one. Then he filled his pipe, but a lighter or a match there was not. He had not a scrap of paper or a fusee about him, and at last he flung the offending pipe into the fire.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302606">'I say, Lily!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302607">'M—m?' said Lily, reading on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302608">'Have you a headache?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302609">'Oh no!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302610">A moment later the book shared a similar fate to the pipe, being unceremoniously banged under a sofa.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302611">'Then, what is the matter?' Bob asked. 'Why did you go off without any dessert?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302612">'I went off,' said the little woman bravely, 'because you did not want me. I don't like making myself too cheap, and I've done a great deal too much in that way lately.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302613">Bob stood irresolute. He had schooled himself so carefully in the belief that he did not want her that he felt it would be like telling a lie to say otherwise, and yet the prospect of peeling his own walnuts, of filling his own pipe—in fact, of doing the hundred and one things that Lily had regularly done for him—was absolutely appalling; therefore he compromised matters by saying:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302614">'I never said so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302615">'Not in words,' retorted Lily significantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302616">'What do you mean, child?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302617">'Just what I say!' she cried, with hysterical passion. 'You don't want me, though you swore to love me—to love and to cherish me. Yes; I suppose you married me for pity, for you don't really want me, and I wish I was dead!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302618">Bob Sabretasche was not a very clever young man, and it dawned upon him that he had really trodden upon that meek little worm very unmercifully. As always happened when he was in a dilemma, a vision of the kindly, handsome face of his dead father rose before him, and the frank voice rang through his ears: 'Never play a woman false, Bob; it's a wrong once done that you never get over as long as you live; a remembrance of that kind comes back to you long after you'd fain forget all about it.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302619" n="245     A SATANIC A.D.C."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302620">'I wish I was dead, 'Mrs. Bob went on tearfully, 'and so, I dare say, do you!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302621">'I do not!' he cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302622">But since I am not'—with a great sigh—'I think I will go away. Perhaps <hi rend="italic">they</hi>'—she always spoke of her people thus—'perhaps <hi rend="italic">they</hi> will take me in again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302623">The handsome old face vanished, and in its place came a vision of himself as he would be in the long years of the future—<hi rend="italic">alone</hi>, growing middle-aged and old—<hi rend="italic">and alone</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302624">'Don't speak like that, Lily!' he cried, taking her in his arms; ' I cannot bear to hear you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302625">'But you don't want me; I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> you don't!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302626">'On my word, I do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302627">She had taken his word before—she took it again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302628">And, after all, when old Ray died they came in for something like a million of money, and they did not have to wait so very long for it, either.</p></div></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_086" n="18" type="story"><head>A SATANIC A.D.C.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302629">LUCY MOORE was cook in the family of a well-to-do professional man in the old city of Liliminster, and, to use her mistress's words, was a perfect treasure. In these days perfect treasures are very hard to meet with in any class of life, but most of all in the kitchen—a fact of which Mrs. Johnson was very well aware, and for that reason took great care of Lucy, and did everything she could to make her satisfied with her place.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302631">Many people maintain that servants are what the mistresses make them, so perhaps Mrs. Johnson's own disposition may nave had something to do with the excellence of Lucy's. Never had a girl so kind and good a mistress—so Lucy said; and never had any mistress a better servant—so Mrs. Johnson said. Her kitchen was always the very picture of neatness; the dish-covers and pans shone like burnished silver in the sunshine; the range was never dull; the oven was always clean when required—a little circumstance most housekeepers understand the value of. And best of all was the appearance of Lucy herself. Her plentiful brown hair was always smoothly Crushed and coiled into a neat knot at the back of her head; she had a bright, intelligent face, with soft gray eyes, good <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302630" n="246     CAVALRY LIFE"/>teeth, a white throat, and <hi rend="italic">invariably</hi> a clean collar. Small wonder was it, therefore, that Mrs. Johnson was for ever haunted by a great fear lest some unprincipled young man should discover Lucy's charms and carry her off in triumph. Still, as Lucy was turned three-and-twenty and seemed hard to please, she was not without hopes that the evil day might yet be put off for an indefinite period.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302632">But Mrs. Johnson had reckoned without her host, for one fine morning, when she went as usual into the kitchen, Lucy took her breath away by expressing, in the much-dreaded formula, that she 'should like to leave this day month, m'm.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302633">'To leave?' the poor lady gasped. 'Why, Lucy, what is the matter?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302634">'Well, m',' returned Lucy, with a blush,' it isn't that anything's the matter; but—I'm going to be married.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302635">'Married?'—with a great sigh. 'Well, Lucy, I am glad for your happiness; but, oh dear! what <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> I do without you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302636">'Oh, there's plenty more to get, m'!' said Lucy, with a pleased blush; 'and it's such a good place you are sure to get suited.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302637">'Well, we must hope so,' returned Mrs. Johnson, not very hopefully. 'And so you are going to be married, Lucy? I hope you have made a careful choice; marriage is a serious business.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302638">'Yes, m'; but he is a very steady young man,' Lucy answered proudly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302639">'And what is he?—what is his name, Lucy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302640">'His name is Jinks, m'. Yes, m', Henry Jinks, and he's a soldier.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302641">'A <hi rend="italic">soldier?</hi> Oh, Lucy!' Mrs. Johnson almost screamed. 'Oh, I am sorry—I am sorry!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302642">'There's no call for that, m', <hi rend="italic">I'm</hi> sure,' said Lucy, in an offended tone; ' he's a very fine young man.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302643">'But, my poor girl, you don't know the life you have before you!' cried the mistress, being old-fashioned, and classing all soldiers as 'bad in a lump'—'you don't indeed. A soldier has some fourpence-halfpenny a day when his expenses are paid, and how can you live on that—after being accustomed to a good table, too? Why, even if you can get put on the strength of the regiment, you will only have one room—perhaps not that—and seventeen dirty soldiers to wash for.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302644" n="247     A SATANIC A.D.C."/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302645">'Well, m',' Lucy answered, ' I never saw a dirty soldier yet, and I fancy if one was to keep himself dirty he would very soon get himself into trouble; and as to washing for them, I'm not going to do that. He's got leave to be married, but I'm going to live as cook with Mrs. Sabretasche, one of the officers' ladies. My young man is servant to Mr. Sabretasche, and lives in the house, and so, as Mrs. Sabretasche has had a deal of trouble with her servants, being a very young lady, I'm going to be cook-housekeeper for her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302646">'And how will you do if you've half a dozen babies?' the mistress asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302647">'Why, m', Mrs. Sabretasche says she'll risk that,' Lucy answered, with another blush.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302648">And so in due time Lucy Moore was transformed into Lucy Jinks, and took up her abode in the Sabretasches' domicile. Everyone was benefited by the change excepting Mrs. Johnson, who got an idle, dirty, incompetent person in Lucy's place, and never ceased bewailing the loss of her perfect treasure. On the very first evening of Lucy's rule, Bob Sabretasche had a dinner as well cooked as he could have got at the mess, and his satisfaction reflected itself upon Mrs. Bob. Not that she cared much about cooking, but it was nice to see Bob pleased.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302649">'Tell your wife, Jinks,' said Bob, when the dessert was placed on the table, ' that I've the very highest respect for her; she's a very clever woman.' And so Mr. and Mrs. Jinks ' were pleased also, for everyone likes well-merited praise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302650">'It's a great piece of good luck, Lily,' said Bob, when Jinks had departed. 'We must take care of them both, for Jinks is a clever servant, and a woman who can cook like that is not to be met with every day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302651">'No, it is a comfort,' Lily answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302653">For a few months this delightful state of things continued. Lucy was a careful, conscientious manager, and made everyone around her comfortable. Jinks was as happy as a man could be, and the Sabretasches positively revelled in little dinner-parties, when all at once there came a change. No; the change was not in the house-work; that was as well done as ever. No; the change was in Lucy herself. She all at once grew nervous, listless, almost sullen. Her hair was rough, her collar awry, and she complained perpetually of headache. Jinks was beside himself, and forgot half the duties he had to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302652" n="248     CAVALRY LIFE"/>perform, for which Lucy rated him soundly, reducing him thereby almost to tears. Mrs. Bob told Bob she was very uneasy about Lucy, and Bob, who had noticed the change in her personal appearance, asked the doctor to step in and look at her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302654">The doctor did step in, and immediately asked if she had anything on her mind?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302655">Lucy looked nervously round and stammered, 'No, sir,' whereupon he promised to send her a little soothing medicine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302656">In due time the medicine arrived and Lucy took it—she also took some wine, which Bob sent down for her; but neither medicine nor wine had the slightest effect upon her nerves, and after a few days she confided to Mrs. Bob that she must leave the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302657">'Leave!' Mrs. Bob echoed blankly. 'Oh, Lucy, why?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302658">'I never!' exclaimed Jinks, the plate in his hand falling to the ground in his consternation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302659">'The devil!' ejaculated Bob, aghast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302660">'Ah-h-h-h!' shrieked Lucy in terror, then sank down upon the nearest chair and, covering her head with her apron, burst into a torrent of tears.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302661">It was an unusual and impressive scene. Mrs. Bob sat in her chair weak and trembling; she was just then in delicate health, as Bob remembered; Bob himself stood staring at her, and Jinks—very white and open-mouthed—held on by the end of the sideboard, looking alternately from his wife to the broken fragments of the plate lying at his feet. At the door stood the scared housemaid, having been attracted by Lucy's prolonged scream, and in the midst sat Lucy herself, sobbing and shuddering, and, after the manner of her class, swaying to and fro, as if in the most dire agony of mind and body.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302662">'Now come, tell us all about it,' said Bob persuasively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302663">'I dare not stay, sir,' Lucy sobbed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302664">'But why? Jinks hasn't been ill-using you, surely?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302665">'Why, Jinks isn't that fond——' muttered the owner of the name, under his breath.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302666">'Well, what is it, Lucy,' Bob urged, 'if it's not Jinks?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302668">'Oh, sir, he's as good and kind,' Lucy said between her sobs, 'as a man can be, and I'm that fond of him, it would break my heart to part from him. And I like Sarah—we never have no disagreeables in the kitchen at all. I like you all, sir, and I thinks a deal of mistress, I do—but I dare not
<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302667" n="249      A SATANIC A.D.C."/>
stay. I'm not safe in this house, and I must get away somewhere.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302669">'Has anyone been annoying you?' Bob asked. 'By Jove! I'll break
his head for him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302670">'Me too,' put in Jinks stolidly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302671">'Not safe,' Mrs. Bob repeated incredulously, while Sarah scurried
in and shut the door; 'why, Lucy, who can do you any harm here?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302672">'I'll tell you all about it, m',' said Lucy, wiping her eyes with
her apron. 'You know I always get up early, for master's breakfast
must be had punctual.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302673">'Yes, I'm sure you do, Lucy,' Mrs. Bob answered. 'You know, dear,
when Jane was here, you <hi rend="italic">often</hi> had to go
without your breakfast and get something to eat in the mess.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302674">'Yes. Well, go on, Lucy,' said the master.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302675">'When I awoke on Monday morning--a week yesterday as was--it was
nearly half-past seven, and I hurried to get down, thinking of
master's breakfast, you know m'. Thinks I, "I shall have to run to
get it in time," but, if you'll believe me, sir, when I went into
the kitchen all was done. The floor had been fresh washed, the grate
blackleaded, the fire was burning--a big fire, too, it was such as I
never keeps--the kettle was filled and hanging on the bar, even the
plates and cups that you'd had on Sunday night was all washed and put
away. All was done--the steps had been washed, the hall swept out,
and it's been just the same ever since. I went up to see if Sarah had
been helping me, which I thought was queer, as in general she isn't a
very good getter-up; but there she was in bed, sound asleep, just as
I'd left Jinks. Oh, I must go,' she ended, with a fresh burst of
tears, 'I must go, for I'm not safe here!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302676">'But Lucy,' said Bob at last, 'why are you not safe? Who do you
think has done all this?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302677">Lucy looked cautiously round, puckered up her apron into a
thousand creases, glanced furtively at her husband and Bob, then at
her mistress sitting astonished and tired, and finally said, in a
frightened whisper, 'I think it's <hi rend="italic">the
devil!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302679">As I am writing a true story, I must confess that at this point the
four persons who had been listening breathlessly to Lucy's tale began
to laugh--not merely did they begin, but they continued--they laughed
until they were obliged to sit down and cry with the effort, while
Lucy, thinking the whole
<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302678" n="250     CAVALRY LIFE"/>
world—nay, two whole worlds—were against her, once more threw her apron over her head, and absolutely wailed aloud in her terror and dismay.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302680">'Now come, Lucy,' said Bob, still struggling with his laughter, 'go down and get your breakfast, whilst we think over this business.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302681">'But supposing he should really come, sir,' Lucy protested, 'and I should see him—tail and hoof and all? Oh! I don't know what I should do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302682">'Jinks or Sarah will stay with you,' he said soothingly, 'and you know he never shows himself to more than one person at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302683">'But perhaps he'll come in the morning and carry me off.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302684">'Oh, nonsense! Jinks and I will sit up to-night and watch for him, and if a loaded revolver does not settle him, we must call in the police. Now go and get your breakfast. Mrs. Sabretasche is quite upset by all this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302685">The two women left the room, and Jinks followed more slowly, looking thoroughly mystified.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302686">'A Satanic A.D.C., eh, Jinks?' remarked Bob Sabretasche cheerfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302687">'The very rummest go as ever I 'eard on, sir,' Jinks replied, as he closed the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302688">'Well, it really is odd, Bob,' said his wife, in a puzzled tone; ' now, isn't it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302689">'Very. I say, Lily, all this has upset you. Of course, Lucy's a very clever cook and all that, but it's very tiresome of her to have her heroics just now. She must be rather touched in the upper story.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302690">'Well, do you know, I always thought her a remarkably sensible young woman,' Lily answered gravely. 'However, to-night you and Jinks will see what you will see. What a bore, though, sitting up! I wish, Bob, you would let me sit up, too.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302692">'Certainly not,' he replied, with much decision. He did, however, let her sit up an hour later than usual—partly because she was excited and wakeful, and partly because he looked forward to the long night's vigil with not a little disgust. He had many and many a time sat up all night in his bachelor days, gone to bed at cock-crow to snatch an hour's feverish sleep, and tumble up cross and heavy to his duty; that was all very well, but to spend the long hours of the night in a silent <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302691" n="251     A SATANIC A.D.C."/>house, with only a book and a pipe to keep him awake, was a decided nuisance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302693">'I knew it was too good to last,' he said, thinking of Lucy's little dinners. 'Jinks, 'he said, when the others had gone to bed, 'go into the dining-room and pile up a good fire; I will do the same here—and remember, whatever happens, the women are not to be frightened.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302694">Jinks obeyed, and in a very few minutes the house was as silent as the grave.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302695">One—Two—Three—Four.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302696">'This is becoming tiresome,' Bob yawned, rousing himself out of his chair, with a great stretching of his long limbs. 'Hollo! what's that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302697">'That' was the opening of the door above, followed by the sound of a footfall on the stairs—not a quick, light tread, but slow and somewhat shuffling. He strode to the door, just in time to see Jinks appear at the opposite one, poker in hand, and, looking up the stairs, he saw Lucy herself descending them, her eyes set in the fixed glassy stare of a somnambulist. He stepped lightly across the hall, seeing that Jinks was about to speak.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302698">'Not a word, for Heaven's sake!' he whispered. The figure in her long loose nightdress passed more swiftly by them, and the young man caught Jinks by the arm, perceiving that he was trembling and had grown ghastly pale. 'Don't you see that she is walking in her sleep?' he whispered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302699">'Lord, sir!' returned Jinks prosaically, 'blest if I knew what to think, except she'd gone out of her mind.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302700">They watched her in silence for nearly an hour, whilst swiftly and with wonderfully little noise she performed all her morning's duties; then she went as quietly back to bed again, and in two minutes was sleeping as peacefully as a tiny child.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302701">'Now, then, Jinks, the quicker we get to bed the better,' said Bob, with a shiver and a yawn, then thanked his stars that it was his cook and not his wife who had a fancy for roaming about the house in her nightdress during the small hours of the morning.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302702">'And so you see, Lucy,' he said, with a laugh, a few hours later, 'it wasn't such a very bad devil after all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302704">'I don't know for that, sir,' Lucy retorted brightly—she had taken the teasing very pleasantly—'most of us finds ourselves quite bad enough to manage. Jinks tells me that A.D.C. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302703" n="252     CAVALRY LIFE"/>means an orficer who helps the general, and I think most of us might apply for that post to him as I thought it was.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302705">'You are right there, Lucy,' said Bob, in answer to this somewhat incoherent statement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302706">He looked across the table at Lily's wan face, which of late had seemed all eyes, and thanked God that he had sent in his resignation of that not too creditable post before it was too late. He kissed her very kindly before he went out, even more kindly than usual.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302707">'We must tell Jinks to lock the door for the future,' he said. 'I cannot have you worried, for you have grown very precious to me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302708">'How is that?' she asked, with a flush of intense pleasure.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302709">'Because, Lily, my child, you have taught me that I can get surer and better promotion than as A.D.C. to his Satanic Majesty,' Bob answered gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302710">'Kiss me,' said the girl simply.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_090" n="19" type="story"><head>SERGEANT THE HONOURABLE HUGH BRABAZON.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_091" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302712">THE HONOURABLE HUGH BRABAZON had come to the end of his tether, and, as most people know, that is a remarkably unpleasant position. I was going to say that most people know it from experience, but as it is not very long since I myself did feel such a thrill of indignation from a similar supposition, I will refrain from inflicting the like upon anyone else. Yes; I went to a military temperance meeting—a kind of mission from soldiers to civilians—but I cannot say that I went as a sympathizer. I heard very bad speeches, shocking singing, and I think the very worst pianoforte solo I was ever condemned to listen to. Assuredly I did not go to hear any of those things. I went to hear the band, which was an exceptionally fine one, but I was none the less disgusted when the Quartermaster got up and told us he was quite sure we all knew, <hi rend="italic">from experience</hi>, that 'drunken joy brings sober sorrow.' If <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had 'touched pitch' and seen the error of his ways, it was rather too bad to cry out that the whole world was—or had been—as bedaubed as himself. However, we have been <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302711" n="253     SERGEANT THE HON. HUGH BRABAZON"/>leaving the Honourable Hugh to be what the stockbrokers call a 'lay-by,' and must return to him without further ado.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302713">In the first place, Hugh Brabazon was a younger son of a very noble and mighty house. He was fair to look upon, exceedingly so, standing over six feet in his socks, and being well built, active, and very graceful; he had merry blue eyes, well-cut, aquiline features, and chestnut hair, which grew in little short curls all over his head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302714">He had come of a race accustomed for many generations to be extravagant, and the family trait was not less marked in Hugh than it had been in any of his ancestors. He was extravagant, with a generous open-handedness which might have been all very well if his purse had been proportionately long, and, in fact, inexhaustible; but, unfortunately, such was not the case; he tried the experiment of running a race between his inclination and his purse, and, as generally happens, the latter got the worst of it and made a bad second. What was still more deplorable, Hugh's tether pulled up with a jerk so sharp that, as the most expeditious way of settling matters, he left his 'engagements' to arrange themselves, and—'listed for a soldier.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302715">Taking all things into consideration, it was an utterly idiotic move to make; for, if the House of Brabazon had not much money, it had considerable influence, and in a little time he might have been pushed into something, or he might have married some wealthy young lady hailing from the City, who would gladly have given her thousands for the sake of obtaining those six magic letters, 'HON.' and 'MRS.,' before her name. However, Hugh did not give the House the opportunity of exerting the influence it undoubtedly possessed, but brought his affairs to a climax by pushing himself into the Scarlet Lancers as Private Hugh Brown.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302716">Of course the officers saw at once that he was a gentleman, though the truth concerning him did not creep out for some time, therefore they put him in B Troop, commonly known amongst the men as 'the gentlemen's troop.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302717">There he found his old chum, Bertie Le Mesurier, in all the dignity of a lance-corporalship. The Sergeant-Major was a scion of one of the oldest North-Country families, and an M.A. of Oxford to boot. There was the son of a major-general, the son of a high dignitary of the Church, the son of a major, and Teddy Lloyd, who had been at Eton with Hugh ten years before.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302718" n="254     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302719">As he recognised one after another, he laughed and declared the new life would be glorious fun. Poor Hugh! He did not laugh very long—he had to grow accustomed to a good many things before he learned to laugh again in the old, gay, lighthearted fashion; for, when the novelty of his surroundings had worn off, he was supremely miserable.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302720">He was always forgetting—that was his great stumbling-block. He meant well, but remembering was such hard work. When he met Joey Parsons, who had fagged for him at Eton—a little snub-nosed imp, whom he had bullied and thrashed, and now had to salute—well, it was hard work. Not that Hugh cared a fig for the actual fact of saluting—not a bit of it. He was Lord Brabazon's son—a scion of one of the oldest and proudest families in the kingdom, and his position—his birth, that is—was unalterable. He knew that nothing could make Parsons <hi rend="italic">père</hi> anything but a brewer, with no claims to any other distinction than the possession and pride of a certain income. Besides, Hugh had the old <hi rend="italic">noblesse oblige</hi> feeling very strong in him; he was Private Hugh Brown, No. 842—worse luck!—Vand Joey was Sub-Lieutenant Parsons, and must therefore be respected as such. No; it was not that at all that bothered him; but when he met Joey, dressed like a tailor's advertisement, strutting into the town, with a cigar in his mouth, and the most perfect unconsciousness that the man who passed him was anything but one of the 'men'—was, in fact, Hugh Brabazon, who had thrashed him dozens of times—his inclination to give him a dig in the ribs and shout 'Hallo, Joey!' was at times almost too strong for him; and usually the nearly-forgotten salute was so hurried that, had not Joey himself been taken up with the novelty of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> surroundings, and so full of his own importance, he might have recommended Sergeant-Major Green, M.A., to see that Private Brown, No. 842, was properly instructed in the manner of saluting his officers when out of barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302722">And then there was the food. Hugh really did not know whether, taking the life all round, the food was not the most trying part of the whole business. It might be wholesome, he confided to Bertie Le Mesurier, but, oh, dash it! it was unpalatable. The restriction, the work, the horrible drill, drill, drill, the more horrible uniform, in which he was so uncomfortable and felt such a long-legged idiot, the most horrible riding-school, and the lack of a corner he could call his own, were all <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302721" n="255     SERGEANT THE HON. HUGH BRABAZON"/>very bad, undeniably bad things, but he didn't know that the food was not the worst. The bare table, the tin plates, the coarse food, and the three-pronged steel forks—oh, how he did prick his unfortunate mouth, until at last he went in desperation to the town and bought himself a silver spoon, knife and fork, with a case to keep them in. As he said, with grim humour, he had stood godfather to Private Brown, and was bound to come down with a christening gift.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302723">Just at first it did not ooze out in the regiment who Private Brown, No. 842, was when at home. Those in B Troop who knew him were gentlemen, and respected his <hi rend="italic">incognito</hi>, as he did theirs. But 'murder will out,' and before many months had elapsed the secret of his real name was generally known. It came out in this wise: It happened that Sub-Lieutenant Parsons desired to change his servant. It occurred to him that Private Brown was an exceptionally clean, smart-looking fellow, and he intimated that he should be glad to select him for that purpose. I am bound to say that Hugh immediately went off into the most agonizing paroxysm of laughter that ever embarrassed a private or ruffled an officer's dignity—Sub-Lieutenant Parsons' dignity was undeniably ruffled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302724">'What the devil do you mean, sir?' he demanded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302725">For a moment Private Brown struggled against it, but it was of no use; the laughter broke out again in a more exhausting burst than before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302726">The little officer looked up at the big private in utter astonishment; this was a breach of discipline too awful to realize, but, as he looked more closely, a gleam of recognition came into his short-sighted, boiled-gooseberry-looking eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302727">'I have seen you somewhere before—where?' he asked authoritatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302728">The laughter bubbled up to Hugh's lips again, but in moderation this time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302729">'It would be rather turning the tables if I became fag for you, Joey,' he said, with good-natured contempt. 'Excuse the familiarity, sir, but one is apt to forget sometimes that you are anyone but that young limb of evil, Joey Parsons, and I anyone but Hugh Brabazon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302730">'Hugh Brabazon!' Joey repeated, 'and in the Scarlet Lancers! I must have been blind.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302732">'I often thought so,' Hugh said easily. 'Well, sir—Lord, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302731" n="256     CAVALRY LIFE"/>fancy my saying "sir" to you!—I am very much flattered that you would care to have me for your servant, but——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302733">'No, no, of course not,' said Joey hastily, and resuming his official tone. 'Well, Brabazon, I'm awfully sorry that you've come down to this; the life must be an awful change for you, and if I can do anything to brighten it, you may count on me, for the sake of old times.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302734">'Thank you, sir,' answered Hugh simply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302735">He saluted him as usual as he walked away, but stood watching the small receding form with a huge scorn on his mouth and in his handsome eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302736">'What is it, Hugh?' asked Bertie Le Mesurier.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302737">The scorn changed into a sigh. 'A new sensation, Bertie,' he said, with a short laugh. 'Ah! I wish I could go back to the old ones, when I didn't have a brewer's snobbish son inviting me to clean his boots and brush his clothes for him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302738">'Did he do that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302739">'Yes—did me the honour to wish me for his servant.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302740">'What did you say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302741">'Say? I didn't say anything; I just roared.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302742">'Laughed?' Bertie echoed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302743">'I should think I did,' laughing again at the remembrance. 'I believe he thought of putting me under arrest, only he didn't.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302744">'I wouldn't do that again, though, Hugh. Ridiculing your officers is a serious thing; besides, he may make life very much more unpleasant for you in many ways, if he thinks fit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302745">'But he won't,' returned Hugh confidently—'he won't. You are heir to a baronetcy and I am Lord Brabazon's son, so we are both sure of Joey Parsons' "civility."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302746">'My good chap, I am Corporal Black, and you are Private Brown,' he expostulated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302747">'He knows us both, take my word for it,' Hugh laughed. 'Moreover, he wants to marry one of my sisters, who won't look at him. I never met him after I left Eton, but I heard all about it from the girls; they used to make awful game of him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302748">The danger-signals mounted up to Bertie's face, and he asked, with a great assumption of carelessness, which sister the little cock-sparrow was after.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302749">'Gwen,' Hugh replied. 'Yes, it was Gwen who—oh, hang it, Bertie! she hasn't forgotten the old days, any more than you or I have.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302750" n="257     SERGEANT THE HON. HUGH BRABAZON"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302751">'Bertram Black, lance-corporal of the Scarlet Lancers,' said Bertie in a hopeless voice, 'and she is the Honourable Gwendolin Brabazon, one of the most beautiful women in England.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302752">'With a heart to match her face, bless her!' cried Hugh. 'She won't forget the heir of the Le Mesuriers for a low little scrub of a Cockney brewer.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302753">'I wish I dared think so,' Bertie returned wistfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302754">'Well, now, look here, old man; Gwen's the only one of the lot who has stuck to me through thick and thin. Eva's not so plucky as Gwen, and she is the only one who knows where I am. I send my letters through her maid, and Gwen writes to me every week regularly. I heard from her this morning. If you care to see her letter, you can; she won't mind.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302755">'Care!' Bertie repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302756">'Yes, I see you do. You will see what she says about you, and since she has sent me two photographs exactly alike, she must have meant me to give one to you. You can take your choice.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302757">He handed him the dainty perfumed letter and left him, glad of his friend's pleasure, but with a sigh on his lips, a dull pain in his heart, an utter sense of weariness and restless impatience with everything around him, and a vision before him of a fairy figure, most often clad in scarlet and white garments, of two soft brown eyes looking into his own, of two red-ripe lips upraised to his, of the feeling of two rounded white arms about his throat, and a soft voice whispering, 'I love you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302758">He folded his arms upon the railing of the veranda, and gazed through the December gloom across the scarcely visible rows of barrack buildings to the twinkling lights of Liliminster, two miles away, and as he leant there alone, an exceedingly bitter cry rose to his lips.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302759">'Oh, Nell, Nell, Nell! If I could only bring the old days back again! Oh, Nell!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302761">All was quiet around him. There was an occasional clatter of spurred feet on the corridor behind him; a bad piano went 'ting-ting-tum-tum' in the officers' quarters; there was now and then a sound of laughter from the next block, where the married people lived, and he could hear the measured tramp of the various sentries. Still, the great deserted square was quiet, and Hugh Brabazon leant on the railing, gazing across <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302760" n="258     CAVALRY LIFE"/>it into vacancy—vacancy as utterly blank and empty as his troubled heart.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302762">A shower had fallen during the afternoon, and it might be that the raindrops were still hanging from the roof of the veranda, and so had fallen upon his uncovered head and down his face upon his clasped hands; and yet surely the raindrops would not have been warm: warm?—the drops which fell upon Hugh Brabazon's hands were scalding hot. Poor Hugh! He had got over the roughest part of the new life, but the little glimpse of the old which had come to him in his conversation with his whilom fag, Joey Parsons, and with his sister's lover, Bertie Le Mesurier, had been more bitter to him than all the changes he had yet undergone, and most bitter of all was the fierce yearning which, rising in his heart, had forced that passionate cry from his quivering lips—'Oh, Nell, Nell, Nell!'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_092" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302763">Two years had passed away, and Hugh Brabazon was still in the Scarlet Lancers, not as private, but as Sergeant Brown.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302764">During that period of time many changes had taken place in the regiment. Sergeant-Major Green, M.A., had resumed his own honourable name as a commissioned officer, and his place had been taken by the son of the Major-General, who, if wild, was a first-rate soldier. Bertie Le Mesurier had gone back to society as Sir Bertram some months before the brilliant August days on which I take up the threads of my story; and if there was no Gwen Brabazon down in the old Devonshire house, there was an Honourable Lady Le Mesurier to be found at a certain Elizabethan mansion styled Rest Court, who bore a strong resemblance to that very beautiful young lady, and who frequently wrote to Hugh as 'your very loving sister.' The son of the 'dignitary' was doing as well as might reasonably be expected, considering his training, which must have been on the principle of 'the shoemaker's missis going the worst shod.' Teddie Lloyd they had left behind them at Liliminster in his quiet grave, and Hugh was advanced to the dignity of sergeant. Such were some of the changes which two years had wrought in the 'gentlemen's troop' of the Scarlet Lancers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302766">It was a blazing August afternoon—most people know what <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302765" n="259     SERGEANT THE HON. HUGH BRABAZON"/>
that means, but, happily for them, only a limited portion of the community know what it means when the words <hi rend="italic">at Aldershot</hi> are placed after it. The sun literally poured down, it teemed, it shone cats and dogs, if one may be allowed the expression; and every living thing in Aldershot was probably nearer to sunstroke and heat apoplexy than he or she had ever been in his or her life. Reader, have you ever been to Aldershot? Do you know the bare, bleak, shelterless combination of flints and grit of which Aldershot is composed? For my part, I think Burns was rather out of it when he described his farm as the 'riddlings o' creation'; he could never have seen Aldershot. I never knew a soldier yet who did not hate it, and it has often been a source of marvel to me to determine how it is that anyone can live there from choice, and there certainly are people who do so.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302767">The Scarlet Lancers were in barracks—not camp—and on that particular afternoon Sergeant Hugh Brown was very busy helping Sergeant-Major Todd—otherwise Geoffrey, eldest son of Major-General Colquhoun, V.C., C.B.—to do nothing. Each was in possession of a door-post of the sergeants' mess, that being the only spot where anything approaching to a draught of air was obtainable. Within the long room various bundles of scarlet and gold lace were lying about in more or less advanced stages of the two complaints I have just mentioned, which, as the heat of the day wore off, might end in nothing, or in the hospital and the 'Dead March in Saul.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302768">'Awfully hot!' murmured Hugh, sending out great clouds of smoke from a well-coloured meerschaum, and thereby making himself very much hotter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302769">'Beastly hole, Aldershot!' returned the other; 'and I'll be shot if there are not some tourists coming to look round. Fancy anyone sufficiently idiotic to come to Aldershot for a "hairing"! Why, town must be cool to this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302770">Hugh turned his head in the direction his friend had indicated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302771">'Mr. Sabretasche!' he exclaimed in disgusted tones—'Mr. Sabretasche <hi rend="italic">and</hi> ladies. Hi, you fellows!' putting his head inside the room; 'here's Mr. Sabretasche bringing some ladies round the barracks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302772">The several bundles of scarlet and gold struggled up from their various recumbent attitudes, and there was a general buttoning of jackets and straightening of ruffled locks.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302773" n="260     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302774">'Mr. Sabretasche might know better on a day like this,' one growled, with a great sigh, as the last button slipped into its place.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302775">Hugh took no notice—he too lazy, and the weather was too sultry to admit of argument with anyone. He straightened himself once more against the door-post, and thanked Heaven it was Mr. Sabretasche, and not himself, who was making the round of the barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302776">'Can we come in, Sergeant Brown?' said Mr. Sabretasche at his elbow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302777">'Certainly, sir,' Hugh answered, with a bow for the little lady who never would under any circumstances pass him without recognition, and who persisted in calling him 'Mr.—<hi rend="italic">Brown</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302778">'Good-day, ma'am.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302779">'Good afternoon, Mr.—<hi rend="italic">Brown</hi>,' she returned; 'is it not warm? Too warm for sight-seeing, is it not? But we have a lady staying with us who has never been in a barrack in her life, so we braved the heat.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302780">Hugh was about to make some courteous rejoinder, when he looked past Mrs. Sabretasche at the face of her visitor, visible for the first time, since, as yet, she had carried a large white sunshade. For one moment his heart seemed to stand still; then it went hurrying on again in such fierce throbs that his brain was in a whirl, and he felt as if he must fall. By a mighty effort he controlled himself, and bent courteously down to the little wife of his officer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302781">'It is very hot! Will you not rest here awhile, ma'am?' he said.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302782">If he desired and intended to meet Mrs. Sabretasche's guest without recognition and as a stranger, she did not fall in with his views. On the contrary, she went a step nearer to him, and laid her two little hands on the gold embroidery of his sleeve.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302783">'Oh, Hugh!' she said in a piteous voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302784">Sergeant Brown moved a step away from her, and the little hands fell to her side again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302785">'Why, Nell!' cried Mrs. Sabretasche in surprise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302786">'What are you doing here?' the girl called Nell asked blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302787">'This is the sergeants' mess, ma'am,' Hugh replied coldly; 'and I, being a sergeant—Sergeant Brown, at your service—live here.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302788" n="261     SERGEANT THE HON. HUGH BRABAZON"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302789">'You—live—<hi rend="italic">here?</hi>' the girl echoed. She looked around her with eyes which saw no comfort, no beauty in the room, which was, in truth, both comfortable and pretty. She took in every detail: the long table with its green cover, the prints, and one or two water-colours on the walls, the pair of silver cups, the various presents given by sergeants who had left, either as officers or to go back to their own position, at the vase of flowers on the side-table—it was really a very pretty room, but she saw in it only misery, discomfort, and ugliness, and elevated a nose already inclined that way by nature. 'You, Hugh Brabazon—<hi rend="italic">live</hi>—here?' she repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302790">'Sergeant Brown, if you please, ma'am,' Hugh said by way of correction.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302791">'Don't tell me,' she cried imperatively. 'Do you think I do not know you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302792">'It would be more kind, then, to pass me,' he said in a low voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302793">'I will not pass you. What have I done that I should not speak to you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302794">'It is what I have done,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302795">At this point, Mrs. Sabretasche betook herself into the billiard-room, whither her husband and the other members of the sergeants' mess had gone. Nell, perceiving that they were now alone, put her hands on Hugh's arm again, and, as the wall was behind him, he could not escape; in fact, the tall man was at the little woman's mercy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302796">'What have you done?' she asked; then, in sudden alarm, 'Not got married, surely, Hugh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302797">'Married!' he repeated scornfully, 'to whom?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302798">'Oh, well, I didn't know. One never knows what may or may not have happened. I can't say I should have been surprised, after the horrid way you treated me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302799">'Nell!' he said reproachfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302800">'Oh, you may say "Nell!" as hard as you like.' She laughed—a suspicious laugh it was, for there was a sound of tears in it, and there were glistening drops in her soft eyes. 'Pray, since we cannot stay talking much longer in a sergeants' mess, are you coming to call upon me whilst I am with the Sabretasches?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302801">'My dear child—I am Sergeant Brown, and your host is Lieutenant Sabretasche,' he answered. 'Do be reasonable; it is not likely I can be on visiting terms with them.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302802" n="262     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302803">'Cannot you come for once as Hugh Brabazon?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302804">'It is impossible. Here I am only Sergeant Brown.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302805">Just then Bob Sabretasche came out of the billiard-room, followed by his wife.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302806">'Brabazon,' he said simply, 'will you come to my house as soon as you can this evening?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302807">Hugh looked down upon his uniform and hesitated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302808">'Never mind that, I'll send Jinks out,' said Bob. 'I'm sure you and Lady Helen are dying to—to—talk old times over.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302809">'I am, I frankly admit it,' said Lady Helen, with saucy coolness; 'but my opinion is that Mr. Brabazon wishes to shirk the acquaintance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302810">'Yes, do come,' supplemented Mrs. Bob, 'and I will show you my babies.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302811">'Come and show me the rest of the barracks,' said Helen, in a whisper so coaxing that Hugh hardly knew whether he was standing on his head or his feet. 'Do come, Hugh; don't be nasty. Yes, Mr. Sabretasche, he will come this evening; and in the meantime he is going to show off the rest of the barracks to me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302812">'Very well. Come, Lily, let us go on in front,' Bob answered, with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302813">As the two figures passed the windows, Sergeant-Major Todd and another sergeant went to the door and watched them out of sight—the tall man in scarlet and gold, and the little woman in scarlet and white.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302814">'She's a deuced pretty girl!' Todd remarked: 'I wonder who she is. Seems to have her own way with Hugh.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302815">'She is Lady Helen Fairfax,' Smith answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302816">'Oh, you know her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302817">'Yes. She didn't see me, though. Yes, I know her; my sister married her cousin, the Earl. Lady Helen was engaged to Brabazon ever so long ago.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302818">'Then you are Harry Tyrrwitt? How well you've kept your secret!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302819">'Yes'—with a laugh; 'but don't let it go any further.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302820">'Oh no. So that is Lady Helen Fairfax, is it? I've often heard of her. I didn't know old Hugh was spoons on her. How was it they did not marry at first?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302822">'Hugh got into debt and other difficulties, gave her freedom <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302821" n="263     SERGEANT THE HON. HUGH BRABAZON"/>by letter—and bolted. I didn't know she cared for him still, or I might have let her know his whereabouts long since. However, I suppose it will be all right now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302823">But later, when Hugh turned up again, he did not look at all as if it was all right; of a truth, he was most woefully puzzled. Little Nell, whom he loved so, had crossed his path once more, and would not be treated as a stranger. Poor dear little Nell, who had no money, and ought to marry a Duke at least! The delight of seeing her was still visible in his brightened eyes and in the tender smile upon his lips, still with him in the passionate throbbing of his heart; and yet—what was he to do? He was Sergeant Brown and she was an Earl's daughter—as poor as she was proud and lovely. Even if he left the army, they could not live upon air.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302824">He spoke to no one, being like a man asleep. Nor did he rouse out of his reverie until he found himself in Mrs. Sabretasche's drawing-room, admiring the younger of her two babies, and—as his quickly beating pulses told him—once more near Nell Fairfax.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302825">Bob was not in the room. Mrs. Sabretasche went the length of weaving a polite fiction about an important letter, at which Lady Helen had the audacity to laugh aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302826">'We expected you to dinner, Mr. Brabazon,' said little Mrs. Bob, when the baby-worship was brought to a close.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302827">'Oh, you are very kind,' Hugh answered; 'but I couldn't very well come to dinner.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302828">'Why not?' Nell asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302829">'My uniform,' he began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302830">'Oh, we sent Jinks and his wife to the theatre,' Mrs. Bob laughed; 'and the other two servants brought the dinner in for us. We did capitally—did we not, Nell?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302831">'Yes, all but the visitor.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302832">'Well, I must take this little lady up to the nursery. Will you excuse me for a few moments, Mr. Brabazon?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302833">'Certainly!' He opened the door for her, and Nell, watching him, thought that, although he could not have seen much of ladies during the past three years, he had lost none of the courtly grace for which the Brabazons had ever been distinguished.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302834">'Now,' she said, as the door closed and he came back to the window, 'what have you to say to me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302836">'I don't know what to say,' he answered, drawing her to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302835" n="264     CAVALRY LIFE"/>him and looking down into her clear eyes. 'I think, Nell, you are making it harder for both of us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302837">'Do you know,' she asked gravely, 'what I think of you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302838">'No; how should I?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302839">'I think, when you went off as you did, that you behaved abominably. Yes, Mr. Hugh Brabazon, disgracefully; and now you are going to do penance for your sins. You are, in fact, going to marry me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302840">'My darling, we cannot live upon nothing,' he expostulated. 'You cannot live in barracks, on a sergeant's pay.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302841">'Of course not, you foolish man!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302842">'Child, I have no money besides.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302843">'But I have. Did you not know it? Yes, Aunt Winny left me eight hundred a year, with a recommendation to marry for love, if I could. Now, Mr. Sabretasche, who is quite the most charming man I know, tells me that in a year or so you will have your commission. Until then I shall live "retired." Meantime, you are going to marry me at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302844">'I won't do it,' he said stoutly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302845">'Oh yes, you will,' she replied quietly. 'If you don't, do you know what I shall do? I shall take lodgings in the town and loaf about the barrack-gates, watching for you; and every time you appear, I shall cry aloud in heart-rending accents, "Will you—will you—will you?" <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302846">'My darling, you cannot marry a sergeant,' he cried, fighting desperately against himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302847">'I not only can, but I will,' she replied. 'Why, bless the man, I shall not be Mrs. Sergeant Brown, but Lady Helen Brabazon; and it may only be for a few months.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302848">'Then, why not wait?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302849">'Because I won't. No, no, no! I tell you, I will not go away from Aldershot as Nell Fairfax. <hi rend="italic">I'll drown myself first!</hi>—there!' she laughed. 'Oh, it will be great fun! I shall have a nice house—say in Trinity Terrace—and a couple of maids, and a nice little carriage. Why, we shall be as jolly as possible!—only, they tell me, you may not live out of barracks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302850">'And you shall not live in them,' he said, with much determination; 'to that I have made up my mind.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302851">'Oh, then, you have made up your mind to do as I tell you—otherwise?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302852">'I suppose so'—very reluctantly.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302853" n="265     SERGEANT THE HON.

'Never a day that I have not thought of you; never a night that I did not see you in my dreams; never a church-parade that I did not pray for your happiness, never mind what my life would be without you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302858">'Very considerate of you, I'm sure,' she remarked, nodding her head sagely; 'very considerate, ve—ry! And did you ever wonder if I sometimes thought about you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302859">'Often!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302860">'I'm glad of that.

Every child knows a story in which Bess, Essex, a Countess, and a ring, played important parts—who, I wonder, would have been any of them? There was the Martyr King!—what of his promises? As I said, one might go on multiplying instances for ever, but that is what I must not do, for my story is strictly of the present day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302874">Perhaps in no class of life is my theory so indisputably apparent as it is in the service. Over every camp or barrack N——keeps an eye, and careful indeed is he to keep his accounts in strict order. No vestige of a rule may be infringed, no duty shirked, no ill-temper pass unpunished, no honour remain unnoticed; and among the Scarlet Lancers no longer credit was given than in any other regiment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302876">The Scarlet Lancers had been nearly six months at Liliminster—quarters with which they were very well satisfied. They had good hunting, good society, roomy, comfortable barracks, a convenient hospital, and an excellent cathedral service on Sunday afternoon. Better than that, there was a circus—at least, during three months one had been settled in the town—a respectable little theatre, and a subaltern who bore practical jokes with the most angelic and lamb-like demeanour. Nay, I am not by any means sure that Anthony Geoghegan's disposition might not have ranked higher than either of the two standards I have quoted, for I fancy by the end of a month or so even an angel or a lamb would have rebelled against the course of treatment he was expected to—and, in fact, did—undergo. Yes, he might have taken a very high rank, the first prize, indeed, if he had gone in for competition at a patience show, had not a circumstance occurred which caused a change. Every form of practical joke did he experience that the ingenuity of man could devise, but at last, after <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302875" n="268     CAVALRY LIFE"/>two years of martyrdom borne in uncomplaining silence, the trodden worm turned with such a vengeance that the gentlemen known as the officers of the Scarlet Lancers began to think it as well to run up no more 'ticks' with N——, by means, that is, of Anthony Geoghegan.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302877">The awful change came about in this wise. Like many Irishmen, Anthony was of a fair-haired, blue-eyed type, a tall strong man, much given to laughing, and scarcely seeming to possess a temper at all. He was fairly well off, had no debts, and was not a little sick of barrack life and broken rest. So he fell over head and ears in love, and announced to his disgusted comrades that he was going to be married. The Scarlet Lancers were utterly taken aback.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302878">'Tony going to be married!' exclaimed Clarke, when Tony had departed, after making the announcement. 'Oh, that's the very devil!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302879">'Make the most of him whilst we have got him,' suggested Hartog.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302880">'Who's the girl?' asked Joey Parsons.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302881">'Miss Linden,' returned Bob Sabretasche; 'her father was Colonel of the 60th Hussars. Awfully nice girl, but I fancy rather a sharp temper.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302882">A comprehensive 'Ah!' came from the lips of the several officers assembled, and in the mind of more than one an idea suggested itself that out of Miss Linden's sharp temper not a little fun might be had. Whilst they were still talking over Tony's engagement, he passed the windows of the mess-room, apparently with the intention of going into the town.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302883">'Hollo, Tony!' shouted Hartog, throwing up the window beside which he was standing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302884">'Yes,' was shouted back.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302885">'Do you dine here to-night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302886">'No—concert in town,' was the answer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302887">'An idea has occurred to me,' said Hartog, shutting the window. 'Tony is going to dine in town—with Mrs. and Miss Linden, of course—afterwards going to a concert.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302888">'Yes,' said the others, crowding round him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302889">'Dundas five minutes ago got out of a hansom with his gun and eight or ten brace of young rooks dangling to a string.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302890">'Well?' they cried impatiently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302892">'Well,' Hartog laughed; 'Tony's man will lay his things <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302891" n="269     N--; OR, AS WE GO ON"/>out early, of course, and whilst he is at his tea we will place the young rooks—bless 'em!—in connection with Tony's dress clothes, and then, in all probability, we shall have considerable diversion at the concert this evening.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302893">'I don't see the joke,' said Joey Parsons, at which three or four of the others laughed again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302894">'That's because you are a Cockney, my child,' Hartog laughed. 'But just try the experiment of shaking a few young rooks over your own clothes, and you'll very soon find yourself in the plight our young lover will be in to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302895">'Not fleas?' Joey ejaculated. 'Oh, I think that will be rather beyond a joke—we've no business to worry the girl.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302896">'The girl had no business to hook one of our best men,' one growled in reply. 'We shall <hi rend="italic">never</hi> her Tony.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302897">All unknowing of the plot against him, Anthony Geoghegan rushed into barracks at the very last minute to dress, and, without going into the mess-room, jumped into a cab and drove off to his <hi rend="italic">fiancée's</hi> domicile. Before he had got half-way there Tony was woefully uncomfortable. <hi rend="italic">They</hi> had found their way to his skin, and were biting as if they had fasted for a month. Probably they found Tony better supplied with blood than the young rooks had been.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302898">'Ugh! dash it!' muttered Tony to the cushions of the dilapidated cab, 'I must have got a flea.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302899">A flea—dozens, if he only knew it, but he didn't. He shook himself like a Newfoundland dog just out of the water, but, although perhaps he momentarily displaced them at their operations, they returned to the charge with more fury than ever, and Tony went into his lady-love's presence in as uncomfortable a state as ever any lover was in. Uncomfortable!—he was undergoing torture!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302900">Miss Linden was alone in the drawing-room. Such a pretty girl, sharp as any hawk, with brilliant hazel eyes, nut brown hair, and a complexion like cream, with just a dash of pink across the cheeks—a lovely girl! and at the sight of her Anthony Geoghegan forgot his bodily discomfort for a moment, and took her in his arms and kissed her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302901">'You have not been very long,' she said, smiling up at him. 'Mother is not yet ready.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302902">'I'm glad of that—ersche!'—with a great jump and a mental ejaculation of 'Lord, how the devils do bite!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302903">'What's the matter?' said Evelyn.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302904" n="270     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302905">'Nothing, darling, just a twinge here, that was all'—laying his hand on his left side.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302906">'Your heart is not affected, Anthony?' she said, in sudden alarm.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302907">'No, no, a mere stitch—ersche!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302908">'Anthony, it is there still!' she cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302909">Another mental ejaculation of, 'Yes, dash it—it's there safe enough!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302910">'Suppose you give me a kiss—that will cure me safe enough,' he suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302911">Miss Linden was not averse to the cure he proposed, and put her arms round his neck very affectionately; her arms were very pretty, Tony particularly noticed that, and her throat and bosom were as white as snow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302912">'What a pretty dress that is, Evelyn!' he remarked. 'I've not seen you wear it before.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302913">'No; I'm glad you like it, dear. Do you think this colour suits me?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302914">'I believe there are two,' returned Tony absently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302915">'What?' said Evelyn, opening her brilliant eyes very wide. 'Two what?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302916">'Er—I believe I was thinking about something else,' he stammered, reddening a little. 'Forgive me, darling; you were speaking about the dress. Yes, I like that soft, creamy colour very much, and those quaint yellowish trimmings are charming.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302917">Soon after Mrs. Linden appeared, and they went in to dinner. At first Evelyn talked a good deal, but gradually relapsed into comparative silence, and Mrs. Linden had all the conversation to herself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302918">'This is dreadful!' said Tony to himself; 'I shall never be able to exist through the concert.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302919">He watched his <hi rend="italic">fiancée</hi> furtively, and presently noticed an uneasy movement of one shoulder, and saw one little hand steal up the sleeve of her gown.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302920">'She's got one,' he thought; 'there must have been ever so many.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302922">However, at last the repast was ended, and, after a cup of coffee, they betook themselves in a cab to the concert-room, Mrs. and Miss Linden, of course, occupying the back seat. That fatal drive! No sooner did Mrs. Linden, who was a lady of ample proportions, get settled in her chair, than she <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302921" n="271     N--; OR, AS WE GO ON"/>whispered to her daughter, who sat between her and Tony: 'My dear, I've got a flea about me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302923">'So have I,' returned Evelyn tragically. 'I believe I have got two.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302924">Then she had to listen to a tender little speech from Tony—he had a lull just then; but as soon as she turned her head Mrs. Linden claimed her attention again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302925">'My dear, I shall never be able to stay all the evening. This thing is driving me crazy. I never could sit quiet with a flea about me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302926">'Hus—sh—sh—sh!' whispered Evelyn, with a nervous glance behind her. She just looked aside in time to see Tony make a vigorous attack upon one arm; he had taken the opportunity, whilst her head was turned, to give his sleeve a good scrub up and down. He reddened so visibly that an unworthy and suspicious thought made its way into her mind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302927">'Dear me!' she reflected, 'I've heard Irish people are dirty, but——'She gave one swift side-glance at Tony's fair skin and spotless linen, and immediately went off into a fit of laughter, impossible to explain, in spite of his entreaties that she should do so, but for all that perfectly intelligible to half a dozen pairs of eyes looking on from the other side of the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302928">Assured of the success of their plan, Jack Hartog and his confederates continued the treatment, and for a fortnight or so the three victims were submitted, by means of poor Tony, to a perfect plague of fleas.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302929">'It is a most extraordinary thing,' exclaimed Mrs. Linden one evening, after Tony had taken his departure, and she had been entertaining on a more lavish scale than usual, 'that when Anthony comes I seem to have these things worse than ever. I'm sure it's far too early in the year for them. I can't think where they all come from.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302931">It happened that on that very same evening Tony went back to his room rather earlier than the mischief-makers expected, and surprised them at work with the batch of young rooks which daily fell victims to become the means of discomfort to three unsuspicious and unoffending people. Tony entered the room quietly, not from any desire to creep in unawares, but simply because his thoughts were occupied, and he was therefore walking slowly. The scene which presented itself was decidedly a novel one. Round the sofa-bed, with <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302930" n="272     CAVALRY LIFE"/>its bearskin cover, stood five or six officers, and in their midst Jack Hartog, with the bunch of birds tied on the end of a stick. He was shaking and rolling them upon the fur rug vigorously, amidst roars of laughter from the entire assembly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302932">'What the devil are you doing?' exclaimed Tony, in very genuine and open-mouthed astonishment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302933">The group confronted him with a start, but Jack Hartog turned round coolly, with the stick still in his hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302934">'Oh, it's you, is it, old man? What's brought you back so soon?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302935">'It's half-past ten,' Tony answered. 'What on earth are you doing here, and what the deuce are those birds for?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302936">'Birds?' Jack repeated; 'what birds?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302937">'Why, those young rooks you've got tied to that stick, of course,' Tony retorted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302938">'Well, the fact is, we were going to put them into your bed,' Hartog said at last, with a great air of making a clean breast of the matter. 'Little joke, you see, Tony. There, now, don't turn crusty, old chap! We've let you alone lately, and we haven't much more time left to plague you in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302939">The light began to dawn upon Tony's mind. He crossed the room, and in silence took a pistol from its case on a side-table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302940">'Now,' he said quietly, 'you fellows clear out of my room, or, upon my soul, I'll fire! I've found you out at last; but, take my word for it, you've played your last joke in this room.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302941">After a faint show of resistance, they did leave the room, Hartog allowing the birds to remain on the floor. Tony picked them up, slipped them off the stick, and flung them after the retreating party, catching Hartog just in the nape of the neck, and, as Tony said to himself, with a grim laugh, making him thoroughly uncomfortable for the rest of the night.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302943">He shut the door and locked it, flung the fur rug from the bed into a remote corner, and sat down to think. Now, nine times out of ten, when a man or woman sits down for the express purpose of thinking, the matter on hand is of an unpleasant nature. So it was with Anthony Geoghegan. His thoughts were very bitter, for not an hour previously Evelyn Linden had spoken to him very seriously, and asked him to take back his ring and consider the engagement at an end. Naturally, he had pressed her to give him some reason, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302942" n="273     N--; OR, AS WE GO ON"/>but in vain. She only repeated that she wished the engagement at an end.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302944">'Tell me you no longer care for me,' he said to her, 'and I'll go away and never trouble you again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302945">'I cannot marry you,' said Evelyn, evading his question.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302946">'What have I done?' the poor fellow cried. 'Oh, Evelyn, I would have made you so happy!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302947">Miss Linden shuddered—yes, positively shuddered, as Tony particularly noticed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302948">'It is of no use, Mr. Geoghegan; I have not been happy the last fortnight, neither has my mother, and, believe me, it is best at an end.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302949">Until he reached his room her decision had puzzled him, but the little episode of the rooks had enlightened him considerably. Poor little darling! she had been eaten alive as he had been. However, to-morrow he would go and ask her plainly if that was the cause of his dismissal, and then, surely, everything would come right.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302950">Unfortunately, he was on duty the next day, and could not go out of barracks; but on the day following that he hurried to Mrs. Linden's house, and found—<hi rend="italic">the place shut up</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302951">For a moment Anthony was bewildered; then it dawned upon him that, after all, the fleas could not have been the cause of Evelyn's desire to close the engagement. Evidently, she wanted to be rid of him; evidently, she cared nothing about him. He remembered how, on the night of the concert, she had put her soft white arms round his neck and kissed him, but it had all been a sham—make-believe love—counterfeit coin!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302952">He never thought of writing to her, or of trying some time in the future to win her woman's heart—oh no! The Scarlet Lancers had accomplished their end finely, but the process had left Anthony Geoghegan with a decided distaste for practical jokes; indeed, if the truth be told, he vowed a mighty vow that his brother officers should get no more fun out of him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302953">Nor did they! During the morning of the following day a couple of intelligent workmen appeared, asking for Mr. Geoghegan. He took them up to his room, and they spent about a quarter of an hour measuring the dimensions of the doorway with a foot rule.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302954">'Going to have an iron door put, Tony?' was the careless question of an officer passing.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302955" n="274     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302956">'Oh no!' returned Tony, in as careless a tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302957">For a week nothing new appeared in Tony's quarters, but at the end of that period the intelligent workmen came on the scene again, one carrying a basket full of tools, the other having a large light burden, carefully enveloped in cloths. They made their way to Tony's room, the door was closed and, beyond a little screwing and hammering, no one could guess what was going on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302958">Tony himself gave them no opportunity of discovering. He did not go to dinner until the very last minute, and when one who had waited to see him leave his room tried the door, it was locked. Evidently there was some mystery in Tony's apartment; but, whatever it was, Tony did not enlighten them. He was a little quiet throughout the meal, but not in the least sulky, and towards eleven o'clock betook himself to bed, with a civil 'good-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302959">The conspirators waited half an hour or so before they followed him, as they had done regularly every night since he had caught them with the rooks. They stepped softly along the corridor and tried the door. It was open! Yes; the handle turned easily, and the door opened. Clarke and Hartog stepped into the room, lighted only by the fire-glow, when 'Hur—r—r—r—ah!' was their simultaneous cry.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302960">'What is it?' asked those in the rear, pushing them forward again to meet that invisible enemy, which once more extracted that shuddering cry from both of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302961">'What the deuce is it?' cried another, pressing forward. 'Oh—h, Lord! what's that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302962">'Galvanism,' replied Hartog—'but where is it? Hi! get a light, somebody, and let's find out what and where the confounded thing is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302963">Clarke fetched a light from his room opposite, and beheld, if you please, a square cage, fitting completely over the door, made of strong brass wire, and attached to it an electric battery, which stood on a table by Tony's bed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302964">'Oh, there can't be much strength in that!' said Hobbs scornfully; 'I'll pull that down in two minutes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302965">'Try,' returned Hartog, shaking his fingers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302966">He put his back against it, and tried to force the wires through, but Tony turned on such a current of electricity that the youthful Hercules fell to the ground in something very much like a swoon.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302967" n="275     N--; OR, AS WE GO ON"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302968">'Oh, hang it, Tony, don't kill the poor chap!' exclaimed Hartog.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302969">'Take the poor chap out of my room, then,' returned Tony, from under the bedclothes, 'and don't trouble yourselves to come drawing me any more. I am perfectly sick of it, and, bedad, I won't have any more of it;' after which he rolled himself afresh in the bedclothes, and refused to utter another word.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302970">And that was all about it. The <hi rend="italic">dénouement</hi> is awfully flat, is it not? Yet, when a thing comes to an utter and complete close, one can make neither more nor less of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302971">So the officers of the Scarlet Lancers felt flat—very! It was no use attempting any more fun with Tony. They began to wish his engagement had gone on, for it would have been better to have lost him altogether than to have had that tantalizing birdie inside that impregnable electric cage. And Tony was so wonderfully good-tempered about it, too; if he would only have sulked or been disagreeable, it would not have been half so bad. Ah! N——had taken a novel way of paying off old scores that time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302972">And Evelyn Linden—what of her? She and her mother remained some months away from Liliminster, on an allowance of so much a week from N——. His coinage was varied—bitter tears, sad sighs, sleepless nights, yearnings, longings, regrets. Poor Evelyn!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302973">It was not long after their return home that Joey Parsons, in a burst of confidence, told her all about the plot of the rooks and the electric cage. She said very little, but when the good-natured young soldier had gone she wept tears so bitter that N——relented, and put an idea into her mind to write Tony a note, asking him to call on her. She sent it by the man-servant, expecting he might, perhaps, come the next day; but within an hour he appeared, flushed with expectation and hope.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302974">'Oh, Tony!' she cried, springing from her seat; and Tony kissed her.</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302975" n="276     CAVALRY LIFE"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_100" n="21" type="story"><head>A REGIMENTAL LODGE; OR, HOW JACK HARTOG WAS MADE A
FREEMASON.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_101" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302976">'TAKE my advice, Jack,' said old General Hartog to his son, when he joined the Scarlet Lancers, 'never to be surprised at anything. Take everything as a matter of course, and if the laugh happens to turn against yourself, laugh harder than any of 'em.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302977">'Very well, sir,' said Jack cheerfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302978">'And remember this: if—and of course they will—if they attempt to hoax you, always let them play the game out, before you show them you are not such a fool as you look.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302979">'I suppose I do look a fool,' said Jack rather ruefully, stealing a glance at himself in the glass opposite.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302980">'Well, my dear lad, you're an uncommon fine fellow—there's no doubt about it,' the old soldier answered, eyeing his son's six feet of splendid manhood proudly; 'but men who don't manage to get into the army before one-and-twenty, and then do it by the back-door—otherwise the militia—can't be said to be particularly distinguished in the brain line.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302981">'No, I dare say not,' returned Jack carelessly. 'Well, never mind, sir, I'm a first-rate shot, good across country, A1 at lawn tennis, and a very decent hand at whist; and if there's any fighting, I'll let them see that I'm worthy of my name—see if I don't!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302982">'I don't fear but that you'll do that, Jack,' said the old man with something like a mist gathering before his keen blue eyes. 'I need not have said anything nasty about the back-door; I might have remembered there were no examinations in my time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302983">'Oh, never mind,' cried Jack lightly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302984">He was not thin-skinned concerning his mental accomplishments; did anyone of his own standing chaff him about past failures, he would quote coolly:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302986">'"No, I tarn't speak Frenss, an' I tarn't speak German, but I tan punss your 'ed'"—a speech which, with the addition of a certain swaggering gesture of his strong right hand and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302985" n="277     A REGIMENTAL LODGE"/>arm, generally had the effect of diverting the current of the conversation into widely different channels.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302987">A few days later this handsome, swaggering young fool left the paternal mansion for the quarters of the Scarlet Lancers, just then at Blankhampton, where, as is not invariably the case, he met with a cordial reception. His brother officers 'took' to him. He was very goodly to look upon, for he had a nice, fresh, fair face, with blue smiling eyes and a pleasant mouth, disclosing good even teeth; he was tall and straight, too, with firm, strong, graceful limbs and an inexhaustible fund of good humour. They all declared he was 'awfully' good-tempered. Their most trying jokes he bore with blissful good nature, which, though it perhaps took a little from the zest of their amusement, decidedly won their admiration and esteem. When they amused themselves by smashing his furniture, he set to work and smashed with the best or the worst of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302988">'Do you think I'm going to see my things smashed, and have none of the
 fun?' he demanded coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302989">When he found every coat, tunic and jacket he possessed carefully sewn as to armholes and pockets, instead of flying into a rage, as they expected, he sat down on his bed and cried 'Splendid!' And when they got into his room one night when there had been a big mess, and cropped his fair curly hair like a convict or a Frenchman, he sold them all by going into raptures of admiration over his appearance every time he came within sight of a mirror. After that they left him alone; they said it was no use chaffing such a fool.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302990">If Jack had quietly allowed matters to remain there, I need never have written this history; but, unfortunately, from his youth up, he had been impressed with an idea that the inner life of a cavalry regiment is absolute Pandemonium. No doubt in the General's younger days it was so, for his stories so far threw the doings and misdoings of the Scarlet Lancers into the shade, that his son, so far from perceiving that they were tired of playing their practical jokes upon him, only imagined the calm preceded, instead of succeeded, the storm. He was therefore more closely on the lookout for chaff than ever, and, bearing in mind that he was always to let them play their game out before he showed the extent of his wisdom, expressed no surprise on hearing that there were a good many Freemasons in the regiment, and that they had a lodge of their own.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302992">He simply did not believe it. He had never heard of any-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1302991" n="278     CAVALRY LIFE"/>thing of the kind from his father, and imagined in the casual mention of the institution that a deep-laid plan was brewing for his special delectation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302993">'I suppose you are not a Mason, Hartog?' said the Major one evening after mess, a few days after Jack had first heard of the lodge.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302994">'No, sir; wish I was,' said he with apparent innocence, though he was ready to burst with laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302995">'Do you? Oh, there is no difficulty about the matter. There is no lodge here in Blankhampton, and a good many are glad of the opportunity of joining ours. I fancy when we leave they will form one. We have a lodge to-night; shall I propose you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302996">'If you please, sir,' said Jack cheerfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302997">'I encourage soldiers to join, though, as you probably know, we are not allowed to <hi rend="italic">invite</hi> persons to join our body; I always encourage any desire to do so. A soldier never knows to what part of the world he may not be sent at an hour's notice, and if he is a Freemason he will always find a lodge open to him or brother Masons to hold out the hand of fellowship to him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302998">'Exactly,' said Jack rather hazily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1302999">'Perhaps, Scott, you will second him?' the Major said, turning to a grizzled old Captain on his right.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303000">'To be sure, Major'—with a merry twinkle in his hard blue-gray eyes, or what seemed so to Jack.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303001">'You're in for it. What a fool you were to say yes!' laughed a subaltern afterwards.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303002">'Oh, I always was a fool; all the Hartogs are,' returned Jack with praiseworthy good nature. 'I wonder what they do? Are you one of 'em?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303003">'Oh no; I'm a Catholic.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303004">'Well, what's that got to do with it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303005">'Priests won't let us have anything to do with 'em. Never knew what it was to be thankful on that score before; shut the Major's blarney up in a moment.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303006">'What do they do?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303007">'Stick you on a red-hot gridiron, and chivvy you round the room with a poker.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303008">'Oh, come now'—incredulously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303009">'So they say, but of course I can't speak from experience. By Jove, though, what a fool you were to say yes!'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303010" n="279     A REGIMENTAL LODGE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303011">'Well, if they begin any of that stuff on me. I shall take to my fists,' laughed Jack, of course thinking Vane in the secret also.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303012">'I wonder what kind of a jumble they'll make of it,' quoth he to himself that night, as he slowly undressed. 'Of course, their game will be to gull me enough to make me long to get into a genuine concern, and get kicked out as a consequence. Lord! what a joke to tell my old governor! It beats his yarns hollow.'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_102" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303013">BY means of movable furniture, ornaments and jewels, the members of the Scarlet Lancer Lodge of Free and Accepted Masons had made a very pretty interior. A spare troop-room had been divided by temporary partitions into the correct form of an oblong square, vestibule and outer room. They were necessarily obliged to dispense with the three grand pillars—the Doric, Ionic and Corinthian; but the ceiling was painted in a representation of a celestial canopy of divers colours. They had a very handsome floor-covering of movable parquetry work to represent the mosaic pavement, the blazing star, and the indented or tessellated border; the tracing-board, rough and perfect ashlars, were also in due position, and all the other paraphernalia of skull and cross-bones, coffin, tassels and the like.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303014">It was to this room that Jack Hartog made his way on the evening appointed for his initiation into the secrets and privileges of Freemasonry. He was met by a sergeant, acting as Steward, who was waiting in the outer room to prepare him for entrance. It occurred to him, when the man explained his duties, that it was scarcely the right thing to bring a noncommissioned officer into the working of a practical joke upon a subaltern; and for the first time he, like his father, pronounced the non-purchase system a mistake.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303015">'It has lowered the tone of the army,' said Jack to himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303016">'You'll have to take your jacket oft', sir,' said the Steward.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303017">'My jacket!—why?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303018">'It is necessary, sir,' was the answer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303019">Jack shrugged his shoulders, but off came the jacket. 'Any more?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303020">'Your waistcoat also.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303021" n="280     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303022">Off came the embroidered waistcoat; he began to wish himself out of the business safely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303023">'You must bare your right arm, sir,' the Steward continued.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303024">'I say, they're not going to tattoo me?' he asked apprehensively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303025">'No, sir'—with an amused laugh. 'Now undo your shirt at the throat, and pull up your left trouser so as to leave the knee bare.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303026">'Anything more?' Jack asked satirically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303027">'Oh yes; slip your right heel out of your boot.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303028">'Well, of all the tomfoolery!' Jack began, too hopelessly surprised to be in the least amused.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303029">'And empty your pockets and take your rings off.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303030">'Lord bless me!' he ejaculated blankly. 'Hallo! what's that for?' as the sergeant lifted a rope with a running noose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303031">'To put round your neck—it is technically called a cable-tow.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303032">'Then, let me tell you, you are not going to put what is technically called a cable-tow round my neck,' said Jack, with considerable decision.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303033">'Must be done, sir, if you mean to be initiated to-night'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303034">'Oh, blow your initiation!—and what's that for?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303035">'To blindfold you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303036">'Blindfold me! Not if I know it! Why, I might be scalped, before I could say "Jack Robinson."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303037">'No fear of that'—laughing outright.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303038">'Well, all this tomfoolery,' glancing down at his odd figure, 'is quite enough, without the rope or the bandage, and I don't intend to submit to either of them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303039">'You cannot enter the lodge without them,' was the decided reply. 'Wait a moment, sir, and I'll fetch one of the officers out, who will convince you that it is really necessary.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303040">He went to the door of the lodge, giving one distinct rap—so Jack thought, but it was the Tyler who performed the ceremony—and after an instant's parley, Captain Scott came out and asked what was amiss.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303041">'Why, they want to put that rope round my neck,' said Jack indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303042">'Of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303043">'And to blindfold me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303044">'To be sure—the two most absolutely necessary parts of the ceremony.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303045" n="281     A REGIMENTAL LODGE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303046">'Then I'll be d——d if I will,'said Jack emphatically, sitting down on the chair and beginning to straighten his apparel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303047">'You can do as you like, of course, my dear chap,' said the grizzled Captain good-naturedly; 'but as the Colonel and the Major are both enthusiastic Masons, and as the Major has proposed you himself, you will seriously offend them both, besides making yourself the laughing-stock of the regiment. They will all say you were too big a coward to join.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303048">That decided him, and, with a great sigh, he resigned himself to go on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303049">'Now, look here: if there is any red-hot iron business, I shall kill the first man I get hold of.' he said, as his senior left him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303050">'All right'—with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303051">'Now, sir,' said the Steward, leading him to the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303052">It was as well that he was in ignorance of the pointed sword held to his breast as he walked, or he would probably have turned tail, in spite of that significant hint about making himself the laughing-stock of the regiment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303053">There was a moment's parley between the Steward and the Tyler; then the latter gave three distinct knocks. This was followed by a rap from within, the signal of alarm, and, after a slight pause, a voice asked:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303054">'Who is there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303055">'A poor candidate is in a state of darkness', answered the Steward, 'who comes of his own free will and accord, and also properly prepared, humbly soliciting to be admitted to the mysteries and privileges of Freemasonry.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303056">('Draw it mild,' put in Jack, <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi>.<lb/>'Be serious, sir; it is a grave business,' exclaimed the Steward earnestly.)</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303057">'How does he hope to obtain these privileges?' asked the Inner Guard.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303058">'By the help of God and the tongue of good report.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303059">'Halt, till I make due report.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303060">Then there was a repetition within concerning the poor candidate in a state of darkness, during which Jack resigned himself to the inevitable, with a murmured protest on the utter profanity of the proceedings.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303061">'And I don't go in for being saintly myself,' he ended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303062">'You'll get into serious trouble if you are not quiet,' came in a warning whisper from his guide.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303063" n="282     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303064">Then the door was flung wide open that they might enter; it closed behind him, and retreat was effectually cut off.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_103" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303065">IT was about two hours later that Jack Hartog, once more clothed in his mess-dress, went into the mess-room, where those who had dined at the late dinner still lingered. He was hailed with a shout of laughter, and 'Now then, brother, how did you get on?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303066">'Frightened you out of your wits, hey?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303067">'Have a glass of champagne, my boy?' and the like.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303068">Jack seated himself, and made a grave survey of the faces assembled round the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303069">'I don't go in for being strait-laced,' he remarked deliberately, 'I wasn't brought up in that way; but, upon my word, they went beyond a joke to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303070">'What did they do, Jack? What's it like? Did they stick you on the gridiron?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303071">'Not a bit of it. Never heard of a tamer sell in my life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303072">'Well, what did they do?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303073">'They just made a fool of me,' said Jack ruefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303074">'Impossible, Jack! that was already accomplished,' laughed one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303075">'But what did they do? come, tell us,' cried another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303076">'Well, first they undressed me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303077">'Undressed you!'—with a great yell of laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303078">'Very nearly; I had to take off my jacket and waistcoat, empty my pockets and pull off my rings; my shirt was undone at the throat, my right arm and my left knee were bared, and my right heel was pulled out of my boot. Then they stuck a rope round my neck and a bandage over my eyes—under which, all the same, after a little judicious frowning and wrinkling of my nose, I could see beautifully.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303079">'Yes, what then?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303080">'Oh, a lot of blarney about a poor candidate in a state of darkness begging for light, and all that rot. Oh, it was splendidly got up, only the ceremony was awful trash; any fool could have seen through it in a moment.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303081">'Why, Hartog, you don't think it was a joke—a trick?' said one of the listeners, suddenly perceiving the truth.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303082" n="283     A REGIMENTAL LODGE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303083">'Of course it was; never heard such twaddle in the whole course of my life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303084">'My dear chap, it was the real thing,' Kerr asserted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303085">'Oh yes, no doubt'—with a knowing laugh. 'You're all in the joke, and think you'll be able to gull me into trying to get into a real Freemasons' club, and get kicked out. Ah! but I <hi rend="italic">ain't quite</hi> such a fool as I look.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303086">'Hartog, I assure you there is no joke at all about it,' he persisted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303087">'Well, now look here,' said Jack: 'I've an uncle, who's ever such a great swell in the lodge the Prince of Wales belongs to, and I've often tried to get the secrets and things out of him; though of course I never could. Whenever I chaff him about Freemasonry, he invariably turns as solemn as you please, and says it is a very impressive and grave ritual, requiring a great deal of thought and care to understand and get proficient in. He <hi rend="italic">couldn't</hi> say that of all the humbug and tomfoolery that went on to-night. Why, <hi rend="italic">every</hi> one knows that the Freemasons' signs and secrets are awfully difficult to learn, and this was what they showed me to-night: that's the first sign'—making, as he spoke, the sign of an entered apprentice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303088">One of his hearers rather recoiled. 'Don't do that again, Jack, it's so horribly suggestive—particularly with knives about. Ugh! it gives one the shivers.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303089">'Well, that was it—the first. No, I'm wrong—the first was a kind of goose-step; then that; then the grip, which'—holding out his hand for any of them to take—'was just that and nothing more. As if I was such a fool as to swallow all that!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303090">'Did you swear much, Jack?' someone asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303091">'Oh! no end—on my knees too—most profane I consider it. Yes, on my knees, with my right hand on the Bible, and holding one point of the compasses to my heart—so. Well, I cannot say what I did not swear—all sorts of impossible things. There was something about cutting my throat, and tearing my tongue out by the roots, and burying my body in sand of the sea at low-water mark.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303092">'What! Burying yourself?' cried a laughing voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303094">Jack looked puzzled for a moment. 'No, I suppose they were to bury me,' he replied; 'and, between you and me, gentlemen, I am thoroughly ashamed of having had any part <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303093" n="284     CAVALRY LIFE"/>in the affair. I don't go in for being saintly—as I told you, I wasn't brought up in that way; but I have some respect for sacred things, and I don't approve of bringing the Bible and the name of the Almighty into practical jokes, and I'm very much surprised at a man of the Major's age for doing so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303095">'Well, don't let him hear you say so, that's all,' laughed Lucian.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303096">'Hartog, it is not a joke,' repeated Kerr emphatically, for the third time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303097">'Kerr, it was a joke,' returned Jack, with equal emphasis. 'I tell you there was something about that chap that was after Ruth—I forget his name—and what could he possibly have to do with Freemasonry?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303098">'Oh, that was——' began Lucian, then broke off short, for in the doorway leading from the anteroom stood the Major himself, looking straight at Hartog, with a face of thunder.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303099">Lucian's sudden stop and look of blank dismay caused every head to turn that way, and a hush, as of death, fell upon the excited group. In an instant Jack realized the truth! For the first time in his life he knew what a sensation of sickening fear meant—he could not think or speak, he was conscious of nothing but that those terrible cold eyes were fixed upon him, and that he had made a mistake which would probably wreck his whole life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303100">Amid that death-like silence, Major Bernard advanced into the room, and laid his hand upon the back of a vacant chair at the head of the table; his cold eyes—like the flash of steel, several of them thought—were still fixed upon Jack's fast-whitening face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303101">At last he spoke—not loudly, but in the suppressed voice of a man utterly possessed by a storm of intense passion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303102">'Well, sir,' he said at length, in accents of cutting scorn, 'you are a credit—to—your regiment—a cred—it—sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303103">Jack spoke no word—only his widely-opened blue eyes remained fixed upon his superior's with a fascination piteous to behold.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303104">'You have this evening,' the Major went on, in the same terribly low tone, 'taken solemn oaths before God and your fellow-men, which you have broken. Do you know, sir, that you have ruined your life—that you have forfeited your claim to be called a gentleman, and earned the contempt of every honourable man?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303105" n="285     A REGIMENTAL LODGE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303106">'I—I thought——'Jack began piteously, but Major Bernard cut him short, and continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303107">'Your evidence would not be accepted in any court of justice in the world, sir,' he said scornfully; 'do you know that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303108">Jack looked despairingly around, and caught at the arm of the man next to him, that he might steady himself. The Major went on:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303109">'How it is possible that your father's son can have so little value for his honour, so little respect for himself, so little respect for a stainless name, which to honourable men is in itself alone another term for chivalry and valour, I cannot imagine. Have you no notion of the value of your word? Have you no respect for your solemn oath?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303110">Again Jack tried to speak, but this time his trembling lips refused their office, and the sound died away in his throat. Only he held Kerr's arm with a harder grip, and his blue eyes remained fixed on the Major's face, as they had done from the beginning, while in his brain and heart one question was repeating itself over and over again, 'What will the General say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303111">'All I have to say is,' said the Major, 'that you will be formally expelled from the body of Freemasons, and that my private acquaintance with you is, from this day, at an end. I have done.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303112">He turned on his heel as if to leave the room, but Jack suddenly loosed his hold of Kerr's arm, and, with one despairing-look at the Major, staggered out. As the door crashed behind him, Major Bernard turned back to those standing about the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303113">'I suppose, gentlemen, he has told you everything?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303114">'Everything,' replied one or two voices.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303115">He was once more turning away, but Kerr stopped him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303116">'Wait a moment, sir,' he said hastily; 'I must give you some explanation of this, since Hartog seemed unable to do so. He really believed the whole affair was an elaborate practical joke. I have been trying to convince him that such was not the case, ever since he came in here. Is it not so?'—appealing to the others.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303117">'Yes—certainly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303118">'A joke!' echoed the senior indignantly; 'I play a joke upon him—a lad like that—or, indeed, upon anyone! He must be a fool.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303119" n="286     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303120">'I don't think he is particularly clever, sir,' Kerr answered, 'and as for what he told us, it didn't amount to much, for we couldn't make head or tail of it—neither, for the matter of that, did he seem able to do so. I think you may trust him to divulge nothing further, and you have our word that what he has disclosed is safe with us. Is it not so?'—turning to the others once more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303121">'Oh yes—yes, of course!' they all cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303122">But the Major was not thus easily to be mollified.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303123">'Utterly without principle,' he muttered grimly. 'Hallo! What's that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303124"><hi rend="italic">That</hi> was the sound of a pistol-shot, followed by a heavy fall on the floor above.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303125">'Good God! the young idiot has shot himself!' cried Kerr, pushing the Major unceremoniously aside. He ran along the veranda and dashed up the stairs of the quarters adjoining, just as a trooper's rough voice rang out vigorously for help. The Adjutant's wife ran out of her rooms on the same floor, and several officers and servants followed Kerr, who forced the door open with one shove of his strong shoulder, to find Hartog lying on the floor, bleeding profusely from a wound in the shoulder.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303126">'I was in his room when he came up,' said the servant, as they turned him over. 'He told me to go out, and I seed something was up—I heard the click of the pistol, and I must just have tried to bang the door in as he took aim, and startled him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303127">'Hallo! what's this?' exclaimed the old Surgeon-Major, entering.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303128">'It's your damned Freemason tomfoolery!' returned Kerr savagely. 'Is he much hurt?'—in a gentler tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303129">'No, no; nasty flesh-wound through the shoulder—have him off the sick-list in a fortnight. Now, clear out, all of you. Mrs. Gray will stay with me, and, Ford, you stop; all the rest clear out—we can do better without you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303130">They went back to the mess-room, where they found the Major, very white and grave, and with all the anger and sternness faded from his face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303131">'How is he—not dangerously hurt, I hope?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303132">The intense anxiety in his tones rather touched Kerr, who had mentally determined as he descended the stairs to make out the worst possible case, and give him as great a fright as he could.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303133" n="287     A REGIMENTAL LODGE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303134">'Moore seems to think the danger lies in possible contraction of the muscles,' he answered; 'the ball has gone clean through the top part of the shoulder.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303135">'There is only one way in which his life can be saved from ruin,' said a young officer, coming forward, 'and that is for us all to get made Masons at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303136">'You are right; I had thought of it,' Major Bernard answered. 'It is not customary—indeed, it is forbidden that we should invite others to join our body; but I have the greatest respect for his father—a braver soldier and a truer gentleman does not live—and I had already determined to ask you, who have heard his folly to-night, to save him from further trouble concerning it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303137">'I shall be very glad,' said Kerr, without hesitation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303138">'And I,' 'And I'—in a chorus from the others.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303139">'And what about Vane?—he is a Catholic,' asked Major Bernard.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303140">'I have been sitting with Gwynne all the evening, Major. I only ran out when I heard the pistol-shot.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303141">'That is all right,' in a relieved tone. 'Oh, here is Moore. How is the patient?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303142">'Conscious again, and crying on Mrs. Gray's shoulder like a baby. What a nice little woman she is! I say, what was the matter?—a quarrel?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303143">'Oh no—only a mistake,' said the Major, who, now that his anger was gone, did not care to further publish Jack's misdoings. 'Perhaps, Kerr, you will go up and set his mind at rest. I will come and see him in the morning. For the rest, gentlemen, I need not ask your silence and your forbearance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303144">'No, Major, no—certainly not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303145">'And the request comes with a good grace from you,' growled Kerr, as the door closed behind him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303146">'Poor Jack wasn't far out of it,' remarked Lucian, when the still-angry Kerr had betaken himself to comfort poor crestfallen Jack upstairs; 'it must be a precious tomfoolery business. They won't get me there a second time, I can tell you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303147">'Poor old Jack! how the Major did slang him!' laughed another. 'I say, what was that about Ruth?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303148">'It wasn't Ruth,' returned Lucian; 'it was Boaz.'</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303149" n="288     CAVALRY LIFE"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_110" n="22" type="story"><head>CONSCIENCE.</head><head>CHAPTER I.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_111" n="1" type="chapter"><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303150">HE was alone—a handsome, gray-eyed, sunburnt man, in a fairly comfortable room. I am not going to describe it; only so far as to say that the chair in which he sat was a very big one, and that the fire, to which his long legs were stretched, blazed half-way up the chimney, though it was but the beginning of October.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303151">'Oh, confound—<hi rend="italic">every</hi> thing!' he observed disconsolately to the walls, or maybe the fire, and clasping his hands at the back of his smooth sunshiny head. 'I don't know what to do. I'll be hanged if I know what to do. Poor little Pussey! how her face did cut me up! I can't get it out of my head; nor the widow's either, for that matter. Poor little Pussey! and yet I can't help myself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303152">He upheaved himself from the depths of the big chair—a fine fellow, nearly six feet in height, with clean, active limbs and a perplexed, handsome face; gray as to the eyes, and fair, if a good deal sunburnt, as to the complexion; just the man everyone calls 'Charlie' on the very slightest provocation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303153">As he marched about the little room, his long legs sadly inconvenienced by its narrow confines, the door opened, after a knock from sturdy knuckles, and a lancer, in the usual cavalry soldier's <hi rend="italic">déshabillé</hi> of unbuttoned jacket and his cap at the very back of his head, entered, carrying carefully a small parcel, a pair of newly-varnished boots, and a sword.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303154">'What's that, Fraser?' the officer asked, wheeling round.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303155">'Parcel, surr,' returned Fraser—not his regular servant, who was on sick-leave.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303156">Opened, it proved to be a box containing a bunch of dainty blue forget-me-nots, over which, despite Fraser's presence, Charlie Kerr fairly groaned aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303157">'Here, stick 'em into water and get me dressed for mess—sharp!' he said, smothering a second groan.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303158">'Here's a label on 'em, surr,' remarked Fraser, as he lifted the flowers out of their cotton-wool covering.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303160">'A label!'—taking it impatiently; then read, '<hi rend="italic">For the last</hi><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303159" n="289     CONSCIENCE"/><hi rend="italic">time. Good-bye</hi>.' A moment later the label was burnt to a cinder, and Kerr had turned to the toilet-table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303161">'Get me dressed—sharp!' he repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303162">There were other flowers in the room besides the forget-me-nots: a great Indian enamelled tray filled with the rarest hothouse exotics and ferns, waxen camellias, fragrant tuberoses, gardenias, moss-rosebuds, eucharis lilies, and many others—flowers more fit for the bridal bouquet of a princess than for the bare-looking room of a cavalry officer. They had come up from the town but an hour ago from the handsome widow, whose face just then filled his heart, together with a little woebegone countenance belonging to the sender of the forget-me-nots—Pussey, whose message had been, '<hi rend="italic">Good-bye</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303163">'Well, if this here ain't a rum start,' mused Fraser to himself, trying to fit the message on the label with the perplexed shadow in his master's gray clouded eyes—the eyes that the men of the Scarlet Lancers were wont to declare could see straight through a stone wall.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303164">He would have thought it a considerably 'rummer' start if, after he had left the officer alone, he could have seen him bending over the dainty blue flowers, irresolution in his heart, a forgotten tenderness on his tongue, and what were almost like tears in his gray eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303165">'Poor little Pussey! Shall I go back and make friends with you again? You'll forgive me, I know—nobody'll ever be as fond of me as you, and yet——' He lifted up his eyes to the brilliant hothouse blooms, and in one instant all the old tender pure love had vanished before a remembrance of the newer, stronger passion for the rich, handsome widow who had taken his heart captive by one single glance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303166">'Lord help me! I'm getting more like a drivelling idiot than anything else,' he muttered savagely between his white teeth, and with another great groan. 'Oh, but these women do play the very deuce with one! The poor little woman will get over it and marry a curate in next to no time. Any way, it wouldn't have done to marry her, feeling as I do—it wouldn't have been fairly honest. There's dinner—faugh! all the sherry and bitters in the mess won't give me an appetite to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303167">Just then the door of the opposite room was opened and a young man came forth, singing gaily to the time of his spurred heels:</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303168" n="290     CAVALRY LIFE"/><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Over the hills and far away,</l><l>In a village by the sea,</l><l>A small sweet rose of a maiden dwells,</l><l>Who is dear, so dear to me."'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303169">Charlie Kerr flung open his door, with a very audible and a very naughty word.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303170">'What's the matter <hi rend="italic">now?</hi>' laughed a voice behind him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303171">'Oh, I hate fellows who sing!' Kerr growled testily. 'Always caterwauling about the place like a confounded maid-of-all-work.'</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'"With loving lips and true gray eyes,</l><l>I call her my Rose Marie!</l><l>Over the hills and far away</l><l>Dwells my love, my Rose Marie,"'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303172">sang Calvert in front of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303173">'You're engaged to some girl down in the West, ain't you?' Preston laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303174">'No, I'm not'—curtly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303175">'But you were,' rejoined Preston quickly, adding to himself, as Kerr looked stonily at nothing, 'Ho, ho! my friend, so that's where the shoe pinches, is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303176">Of a certainty the shoe did pinch horribly, though not quite in the place Preston thought.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303178">I wonder, is there any pinch of a moral kind, which is not somewhat alleviated by one's dinner? Under the influence of gravy-soup and salmon the discomfort of Kerr's pinch subsided considerably; an entree of chicken's livers, and venison, with French beans, found him at peace (<hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>.) with himself, the world, and everyone else. He had not reached that age when a mess-dinner becomes a nuisance; when a man listens impatiently to oft-told stories, and looks to the rising of the senior officer as a blessed relief. He was young and strong, and handsome, if not possessed of any great intellectual powers; he enjoyed hearing Power tell how he had 'spotted ' the prettiest little girl that afternoon he had seen for a twelvemonth, 'With eyes like saucers, I give you my word of honour, and the neatest little pair of steppers in England;' how he had promptly tackled her, and been met with as prompt a 'Who are you? I don't know you!' How he had taken off his hat, with the utmost politeness, and explained that his name was Power, of the Scarlet Lancers; how the incognita of the saucer eyes had looked him up and down, and through and through, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303177" n="291     CONSCIENCE"/>until 'By Gad! you know, I felt like some shoplifter', finally drawling out, 'Ah! and a credit you are to the Scarlet Lancers, I'm sure. Have they <hi rend="italic">all</hi> manners as polished as yours?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303179">He enjoyed hearing Garnet, the third up the list of captains, despite his fifty and odd years and his bald head, groan over the evil fate which had sent him into the army twenty years too soon, or had made the abolition of purchase come—so far as he was concerned—twenty years too late.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303180">'I'd be a Major-General now, by Gad! if I'd never been under the confounded purchase system,' he was wont to remark.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303181">And with 'poor old Garnet,' as they called him, was a tradition of a pert young sub, who had condoled with him one day somewhat after the fashion of the comforters of Job—a tradition which by frequent repetition had passed into a universal plaster of comfort for all the ills which can fall to the lot of a soldier. 'Never you mind, Garnet,' this youngster had called out, on the occasion of a troop being bought over the then senior sub's head; 'never you mind, Mr. Garnet, sir—you'll soon be dead, an' then you'll be as well off as any of 'em!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303182">Garnet had got his troop, and the pert young sub had broken his neck at a steeplechase, and his mother's heart at the same moment, but his comfort remained a regimental fixture.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303183">It was not Garnet who entertained them on that particular evening, but the Colonel himself, who, when once started on certain subjects, was wont to hold forth until half his listeners were asleep. His most favourite and inexhaustible topic was the end to which those old women—otherwise the War Office—are supposed, amongst a certain class of officers, to be bringing the army.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303184">'Gad, they'll bring it up to something!' he went on volubly to those in his immediate neighbourhood. 'What is0 the latest <hi rend="italic">fad?</hi> Norfolk jackets and gaiters! Nor—folk jac—kets <hi rend="italic">and</hi> gai—ters. All I can say is, the day that sees my men measured for Norfolk jackets and gaiters sees my papers sent in likewise.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303185">'Well, but, Colonel,' Kerr advanced mischievously for the sake of argument, 'there are a good many advantages to be urged in defence of the scheme—there's no denying that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303186">'And what are they?'—explosively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303187">'Ease and freedom, to begin with.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303188" n="292     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303189">'A good soldier wants neither ease nor freedom,' retorted the Colonel fiercely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303190">'Faith, sir!' put in Graves, laughing, 'I often feel on a field-day as if I'd be thankful for a little of either.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303191">'Oh, <hi rend="italic">you!</hi>' with unconcealed disdain; 'I've no doubt. If ever you come to command a regiment, you'll do without field-days altogether, I dare say.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303192">'Oh, I never shall come to that'—laughing again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303193">'For the good of your regiment <hi rend="italic">in futuro</hi>, it is sincerely to be hoped not,' Colonel Wilson retorted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303194">'Well, but, Colonel,' from Kerr, with a kick to arrest the attention of his neighbours, 'such a uniform would certainly be cheap.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303195">'Cheap, sir! We don't want cheapness; it would simply open the army to a lot of snivelling vagabonds our present expenses keep out of it. Non-purchase lets 'em in, and the outfits keep 'em out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303196">'But I've another plea to urge,' Kerr went on wickedly. 'Less conspicuous in the field. There's no getting over that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303197">'And, bless my soul! why should you try to get over it?' cried the chief, almost bursting with exasperation. 'England always has been conspicuous in the field, and, please God, England always will be—not but what she's made a sad hash of it lately. And whose fault is it? Not the generals' fault—nor the officers—nor the men, but those molly-coddling, stingy old women, who please to call themselves <hi rend="italic">the authorities!</hi> Sending out one man where ten are needed. Less conspicuous in the field! Good heavens! what next? Mark my words, the day that sees England's army clad in Norfolk jackets and gaiters will see England's glory go down with a rush that she will never be able to recover.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303198">'But no army is so conspicuously clad as ours.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303199">'What army has ever been as uniformly glorious? Do you think I have forgotten, amongst all these new fads, how a handful of us kept our ground at Inkerman, against ten times our numbers of those infernal gray-clad Russian brutes, that we could hardly distinguish from the gray mist; only 1,400 of us, and we kept our ground six long hours, until the reinforcements came up and saved us? What was good enough to lick the Russians in at Inkerman, ought to be good enough to lick Afghans and African savages.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303200" n="293     CONSCIENCE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303201">'But you'd have done just as well in your shooting-jacket or your morning-coat,' Kerr maintained.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303202">'I don't know—I don't know at all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303203">'Well, sir, if poor——of the——had been in undress during that sortie from Caubool, depend upon it, he would have been spared the agony of carrying a bullet eight months in his stomach before it killed him; his scarlet facings cost him his life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303204">'Oh, very likely. An individual case, that. Would you reorganize the whole army because of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> case? No, no; depend upon it, I know rather more about <hi rend="italic">practical</hi> soldiering than any of you—or half those duffers up at the War Office, for the matter of that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303205">And, remembering the half-dozen medals and clasps Colonel Wilson displayed on the breast of his tunic, they were all silent. He had got the best of the argument. He rose from the table with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303206">'They'll not carry it in my time; by then they'll have made me a staff officer, with twenty letters after my name—D.A.C.G.—a kind of head-cook to the district, and open to tips from the contractors—eh, Mordaunt?'—bringing a heavy friendly hand down on the shoulder of the man nearest to him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303207">During the whole harangue Mordaunt had been half asleep, but on being distinctly addressed roused himself with a start. 'Never you mind, sir'—pulling himself together sleepily—'never you mind, Colonel Wilson, sir; you'll soon be dead, and then you'll be as well off as any of 'em.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303208">Perhaps it was the absence of the usual laugh that warned him he had put his foot in it; perhaps it was the boiled-lobster expression on the chiefs astonished face. Any way, Mordaunt suddenly became very wide awake indeed, and stumbled to his feet with a stammering apology.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303209">'Oh, I beg a thousand pardons, Colonel! I did not know it was you—at least, I'm afraid I must have been half asleep; you know, sir, I've been up three nights.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303210">Colonel Wilson cooled down instantly. 'By-the-by, how is Colyon to-night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303212">'Bad, sir, bad—very. I don't believe he's had an easy moment the last eight-and-forty hours, and, really, what with the sitting up, lifting and moving and rubbing—anything to get a moment's ease for him—<hi rend="italic">and</hi> the field-day, I could pretty <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303211" n="294     CAVALRY LIFE"/>nearly go to sleep as I stand. It's a horrible business—rheumatic fever.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303213">'Oh, horrible—horrible! Well, if you are going to do all this nursing, you must be excused field-days and duty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303214">'Thank you, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303215">'I think, Mr. Graves, you are the next for duty?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303216">'Yes, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303217">'Nice for you, Graves, you lazy beggar! you were going away on Wednesday, weren't you?' laughed Calvert, as the door closed behind the Colonel and Mordaunt.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303218">'Say a swear, Bones,' laughed another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303219">'<hi rend="italic">Nev</hi>—ar mind, Bones,' put in a third.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303220">'Ah, that poor devil's got rheumatic fever,' answered Graves. 'I couldn't cut up nasty at sparing Mordaunt to him, and oh, by Gad! if ever I get rheumatic fever myself, let me have Mordaunt to look after me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303221">'Why?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303222">'Never saw anything like it—rub—rub—rub, chafe—chafe—chafe, up and down, just like a woman, only ten times as strong. Poor Colyon yells out if anyone else goes near him. I suppose Mordaunt's caught the knack of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303223">'Poor old Mordaunt! what a good-natured chap he is!' Kerr put in; then, beginning to laugh, 'Oh, but it was good his coming out with "comfort" to the chief! I thought he was going to burst.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303224">'No wonder Mordaunt went to sleep with that everlasting jaw—jaw—jaw droning in his ears!' laughed Preston.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303225">'And Mordaunt wasn't the only one, either,' added Calvert; 'look at old Garnet.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303226">Kerr jumped up from his seat in a moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303227">'Hus——sh! don't wake him; get the mustard-pot—quickly!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303228">'Where is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303229">'How the deuce should I know? Ask Farrer.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303230">'Stop, I've got a mustard-leaf in my room. I'll get it in a minute.—There now, stick it in water for half a minute, and clap it on his bald head.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303231">So they did. For full five minutes Garnet slept serenely on; then he awoke with a yell, like the war-whoop of a wild Indian.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303233">'What a dream!' he spluttered, rubbing his eyes. But it wasn't altogether a dream—<hi rend="italic">it</hi> continued. 'What the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303232" n="295     CONSCIENCE"/>devil!——'he began; then he put his hand up to his head and found them out. 'Why can't you leave a fellow alone?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303234">'And what was the dream, Garnet?' Kerr asked when he had recovered from his laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303235">'Oh, I dreamed I was like the soldier at Perim,' Garnet answered, wiping his head gingerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303236">'And what was he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303237">'Don't you know? A black sheep—and died—and didn't go to Paradise, but the other place. Bless you! in two days, back he came for his blanket; he said it was cold, <hi rend="italic">compared to Perim</hi>.'
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303238">'Ha, ha, ha! you know, then, what you'll have to expect,' cried Kerr. 'Hullo! who's that? Why, it's Bootles! Well, Bootles, old man, when did you come, and where do you hail from?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303239">'London—Antwerp—Amsterdam—Norway, etc.,' returned Bootles concisely. 
'How are you all?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303240">'Oh, flourishing,' answered Kerr for everyone; 'except Colyon, who's down with rheumatic fever.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303241">'Colyon! Very bad?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303242">'Very bad; won't get over it, poor chap! I'm afraid. Well, have you had good sport?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303243">'Splendid! Never better.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303244">'Picked up any extra good stories? Garnet here has just come out with a new one, and, oh, such a joke! The chiefs been having an extra jaw tonight on those "damned old women up at the Horse Guards, sir," and sent Mordaunt off as sound as a church. Mordaunt's been up three nights with Colyon. The chief spoke to him suddenly, and he blurted out, "Never you mind, sir, you'll soon be dead, and——"'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303245">'No!' cried Bootles with an incredulous laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303246">'Fact; the chiefs face was a study, and so, by Jove! was Mordaunt's, when he got fairly awake. Well, any news?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303247">'No; but I came across two splendid "'Arrys" yesterday.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303248">'Go on,' cried half a dozen voices; Bootles was a favourite storyteller.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303250">'One was at Antwerp—at dinner. I found him in the midst of a group of deferential foreigners, who probably thought him a lord at least, from the flash rings on his fingers and the amount of pomatum on his head. Perhaps they expected to improve their English—Heaven knows. I didn't hear the beginning, for I was looking at a little girl over the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303249" n="296     CAVALRY LIFE"/>other side of the table, the smartest girl I've seen for an age—jolly dark hair and eyes, and a regular English figure. All said and done, English girls——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303251">'But, 'Arry? get on!'—impatiently from Calvert.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303252">'Oh yes, to be sure. Well, 'Arry, leaning his elbows on the table with graceful negligence, caught my attention with, "Ah, the last time I was outside of a 'orse I gort short orf, and the 'orse 'e must 'ave known his way 'ome better than I did, for when I gort 'ome the poor' orse was standing a-poring at the staible door." My little gal across the table looked at him for full five minutes, then muttered under her breath, "Pore 'Arry!" Gad, it was fine!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303253">Of course, a great roar of laughter greeted the story, nor was he permitted to relapse into a reverie on the attractions of the little girl with the jolly dark hair and eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303254">'Go on,' said Kerr; 'let's have the other.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303255">'Oh, the other was at Amsterdam—a lanky, loose-limbed, lantern-jawed, yellow-toothed Yankee, with eyes like a dead codfish, and a skin like an old parchment deed, with a wife to match. Charteris and I breakfasted at the Amstel, and these two sat opposite. I never so much as looked at the brute, as you may imagine, but he tackled me with, "A fine city this, sir!" "Oh, er—awfully so," I answered. Then he tried Charteris; you know Charteris?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303256">'I do,' answered Preston. 'Big, fair, impressive; speaks at the rate of a word a minute, with a "haw" or "er" thrown in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303258">'That's the man. Says my big Yankee to him, "I kind o' kalkalate these yere <hi rend="italic">Zoo</hi>—logical Gardens are the best in Eu—<hi rend="italic">rope</hi>." Charteris looked up, opened his mouth, then shut it, pulled one arm a little out of his sleeve, then the other. "I—er—think—<hi rend="italic">not</hi>." "Oh yes, I kalkalate they're regular tip-toppers." "Reallay!" returned Charteris, with mature deliberation over each word; "but—haw—I—er—think—if—er—you—er—go—to—haw—the—er—Gar—dens—in—er—Regent's—er—Park—you'll—er——" "I guess not," broke in Jonathan; "at these yere Gardens they've a real live hippopotamus and his missus—only ones in the world." "Haw—no," said Charteris gravely; "if—er—you—go—er—to—Regent's—er—er—Park, you—er—will—not—er—onlay—see—er—Miss—taw—Hippopotamus—and—er—Mrs.Hippo—er—potamus—but—er—Babay—Hippopotamus—er <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303257" n="297     CONSCIENCE"/>—also." I can't quite give you the way in which Charteris said "reallay" and "onlay" and "babay," but I can tell you that not the least little bit of amusement flickered on his good-looking wooden face, not the faintest twinkle came into his steady blue eyes. Gad! he might have been giving evidence on a court-martial; it kept me from bursting out laughing in Jonathan's face. The Yankee collapsed; not one word—good, bad, or indifferent—did he utter to anyone at the table, but when a waiter brought him bread instead of beer, didn't he slang him, rather! However, the cream of the joke is to come, and, oddly enough, neither Charteris nor the Yankee heard it. He left me at Antwerp to go on to Paris, and there I picked up some charming people—half Dutch, half Portuguese-Jewish—father, mother, and two pretty daughters. I was telling one of them about it, when she said, " But do you not know dat de leetal Ba-bee Hippo was born of de Amsterdamsche parents, and <hi rend="italic">sold</hi> to de people at Regent's Park?" Now, did you ever hear of such a sell in all your days?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303259">'Pooh! you make it all up as you go on,' Calvert laughed, struggling with a yawn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303260">'Not I. Well, I am as tired as a dog, so I'll be off to bed. Good-night, you fellows.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303261">'So am I,' said Kerr, following him. 'I'll come with you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303262">As Kerr turned and closed the door behind them, Bootles, otherwise Algy Ferrers, slipped his arm into that of his friend.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303263">'What have you been doing whilst I've been away, Charlie?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303264">'The usual grind. I had three days in town last week.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303265">'See Mademoiselle Mignon?'—with a laugh, and a squeeze of the arm he held.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303266">'Yes, I saw her'—the shadow leaping into his gray eyes again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303267">'And did she send me a message? I say, Charlie, old fellow, I'm glad your future wife likes me as well as she does; I should detest a woman who was jealous of me, and, somehow, nine women out of ten <hi rend="italic">are</hi> jealous of their husbands' friends.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303268">'Pussey will never be jealous of you, Bootles.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303269">'No, I'm sure she won't. Did she tell you I called on her as I passed through; and, as I had the afternoon to spare, I took her to the Academy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303270">'She wrote to me of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303272">'Yes; I admire her immensely; such a perfect little lady—a regular Mademoiselle Mignon! After all, Charlie, we <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303271" n="298     CAVALRY LIFE"/>poor devils, knocking about from pillar to post, can appreciate that sort of thing when we meet with it, which is not often. Now, little Mademoiselle Mignon is not only so excessively pretty, but so true and simple with it. She spoke out so nicely about you; never made a bit of sham humbug about what she cared for you. "If anything were to come between Charlie and me, I should die," she said. We were looking at a picture that suggested the idea; and she said it as if she meant it, too.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303273">'I hope not,' said Kerr gravely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303274">'I hope not, too,' rejoined Booties, misunderstanding him. 'Not that there is any fear of it. I think, Charlie, when you are married, I shall make up to the younger sister; I just saw her for two minutes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303275">'Bootles, I'm not going to be married.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303276">'WHAT?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303277">'At least—that is, it's all off,' said Kerr miserably.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303278">'<hi rend="italic">All off?</hi>' Bootles echoed; 'is it possible? Lord, how these women do take us in! I would have staked my very life and soul on her fidelity.' In answer to which Charlie fairly groaned. Somehow, the groan let a light in upon the other's perplexity. 'Oh,' he remarked, in tones that were decidedly changed, 'then it's you, is it? you surprise me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303279">Kerr looked up. 'Don't speak in that tone, Bootles,' he began; but Bootles interrupted him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303280">'My dear fellow'—with a laugh, a make-believe sort of laugh—'it's no earthly concern of mine; I've no right to take any "tone" at all. As I said before, you have surprised me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303281">'But I want to tell you——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303282">'I want to go to bed; I'm dead tired'—trying hard to make his voice and manner the same; 'talking and telling won't do any good, so good-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303284">'Good-night,' answered Kerr wretchedly. Left to himself, he determined that he would ask for two days' leave on the morrow, that he might go back and beg the girl who loved him to forget the cloud which had come between them, and let things be as they had been aforetime. He thought over all Bootles had said about her—' Mademoiselle Mignon, a perfect little lady—so excessively pretty—so true and simple.' What a fool he had been to let such charms be thrown into the shade by the face of a woman he barely knew, a widow—<hi rend="italic">a Mrs. Smith!</hi> Thank Heaven! the warm terms in which his <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303283" n="299     CONSCIENCE"/>best friend had spoken of his first love had opened his eyes just in time. Not for a week had Kerr felt so happy as when he got into his bed that night. Calvert came singing to his room just afterwards:</p><q><lg><l>'"An arm like iron and a muscle like steel,</l><l>A heart for a friend that can always feel;</l><l>A will, once made, no man can repeal,</l><l>This is what an Englishman is made of."'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303285">And that time Charlie Kerr did not greet Calvert's singing with an oath, or a growl as to 'a caterwauling maid-of-all-work.'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_112" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303286">IT was a great Frenchman who said: 'All things come to him who can afford to wait.' Between you and me, that was one of the most wonderful truths ever written, only there are so many who cannot afford it. Many an artist would make a great name if he could wait, but he cannot; he must daub away at pot-boilers, and push through the drudgery of teaching, trusting to some future time of comparative ease of circumstances to be able to work for a name; and long before that time draws near his style is fixed, and he has sunk into a slough of mediocrity, from which he will never be able to extricate himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303287">How many a writer of talent might make his mark if he could take time with his work—prune it and pare it, re-write and re-model! But he cannot do that. The sordid needs of to-day outweigh the golden promises of to-morrow, and after awhile he finds himself written out, with no elegance and purity of style to fall back upon when the freshness of his ideas has gone. Like the artist, his style is fixed, and a bad, jerky, slipshod style it is; the style that must get on—the style that cannot afford to wait.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303288">And how many there are who cannot afford to wait in a moral sense—whose good resolutions, if carried out at once, would tide them safely over many a slippery place, but, put to the test of waiting, fail them altogether, and end by an even greater backsliding.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303290">Charlie Kerr was one of these. Could he have gone straight up to town and renewed his love for the girl he called Pussey—Mademoiselle Mignon; in reality, Rosa Wendall—it is quite certain that I should have had no further story to tell, save of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303289" n="300     CAVALRY LIFE"/>the orthodox satin and orange blossoms; but, unfortunately leave he could not obtain.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303291">'I am sorry to refuse you, Kerr,' the Colonel said to him 'but I have just had a letter to say the Duke is coming on Friday to inspect the regiment—with a foreign personage in the background—shouldn't wonder if it's the Crown Prince—and I have had to recall those who are away. You can have leave on Saturday, if you like.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303292">'Thank you, sir,' he answered, real disappointment gnawing at his heart.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303293">His good resolutions did not fail him that day, for he had not so much as a glimpse of the fascinating widow; but on the following afternoon, when, after a very long field-day and a long parade, he was sauntering down the High Street, he met her, in all the charms of her beautiful womanhood. Of course he stopped, ostensibly to thank her for the flowers she had sent him—he had already done so formally on paper—but in reality to feast his soul on the glorious loveliness of her amber hair and the blue radiance of her large eyes. Once, whilst he was speaking, it occurred to him she was different.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303294">'Does your head ache, Mrs. Smith?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303295">'My head—oh no, thank you!' she replied. 'I am going home—will you come in and have a cup of tea?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303296">'I shall be delighted,' he answered, turning to walk beside her; and then, alas! the last of his good resolutions went towards the paving of that famous road which leads ever downwards and downwards.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303297">They had their cup of tea <hi rend="italic">tête-à-tête;</hi> and certainly Mrs. Smith did her utmost to amuse and entertain her visitor. She had only been about a fortnight in Bathingtown, where she had taken a furnished house for three months. She explained to him that she had flowers and fruit and things sent from her own place in Wiltshire every morning, and, by means of the first-named, managed to give her rooms a tolerably home-like appearance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303298">'Did you not wonder at my sending you the flowers?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303299">'Perhaps a little; it was very pleasant wonder, though,' he told her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303300">'Yes. I sent them for a reason I will tell you of some day; to-morrow I will send you some for a very different one.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303301" n="301     CONSCIENCE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303302">'You are quite too kind', he murmured. 'Do you know, Mrs. Smith, I am sure you are not well—or you're bothered—or something?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303303">'I am—worried,' she answered, lifting her great clear, limpid eyes to his. 'I went up to town yesterday to see my mother, and there I heard news that has worried me more than I was ever worried before, in all my eight-and-twenty years.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303304">'I am very sorry to hear it'—with a very gentle sigh of commiseration. 'I hope Mrs.—er—you see, I don't know what your maiden name was—but your mother, I mean; I hope she is not ill.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303305">'My maiden name was Bolitho, 'answered Mrs. Smith, watching him through half-closed eyelids. 'No; my mother is not ill, thanks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303306">She chatted on for the best part of an hour, talking fluently and well on many topics, charming him as poor little Rosa Wendall had never been able to do—charming him as a beautiful, rich, thoroughly cultivated, travelled woman of eight-and-twenty can charm a man of the world; and the result of it all was that he went away more hopelessly infatuated and entangled than ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303307">'Come in to-morrow afternoon,' said the fair widow at parting. 'Come any day after five; you will always find me in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303309">Before he dressed for mess, he thought the whole scene over again, with a pipe. In spite of himself, he was a little puzzled. There was something in the background, something behind all the sweet speeches, the coquettish glances, and, for the life of him, he couldn't make out what that something was. He knew very well that if he were not desperately in love with her, her evident—well, what should he call it?—her—her—preference for him would fill him with disgust; and yet behind the coquettish glances was a certain hard glitter that reminded him of cold steel; among all the gay laughter was an artificial ring that jarred upon him; in spite of the downright spooney manner, he had a very fixed idea that if he were to give her a kiss she would slap his face—probably slap it hard! He couldn't make her out. Was she some adventuress, on the prowl for a husband, and did those costly hothouse blooms come from Covent Garden? Who was she? Mrs. Smith might be anybody; and though <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303308" n="302     CAVALRY LIFE"/>he had known a dozen different Bolithos, all in good society, yet the name might be but assumed. He couldn't understand it a bit. But, oh, how gloriously lovely she was, and how he longed and looked forward to the day when she would lay that proud head down upon his breast and promise to be his own! She might be an adventuress of the most outrageous type; her 'place' might be a humbug, her name a sham; her person was what he had fallen in love with, and as to that there could be no deception.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303310">The inspection-day came and went; so did the Duke; so did the foreign personage, who wasn't a Crown Prince at all, but only a Saxe-somebody or other; but Kerr never applied for the leave the Colonel had promised him. Day after day found him in Mrs. Smith's drawing-room—the only visitor. If she was, indeed, as he had suspected, an adventuress, she played a very concentrated game—a game that would inevitably land her fish.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303311">And yet he was more puzzled than ever. The cold steel look, the artificial laughter, and the stand-offishness still remained, though he went in and out of her house like a dog in a fair, and they had become very intimate; nor did she seem in any hurry to get her fish landed. Her three months' term had almost expired, and yet the momentous words had never been uttered—the words he was dying to utter, and those he was dying to hear. Twice, on the days he was on duty, his brother officers, one or other of them, had mentioned the fact that the handsome widow had been up to town; they had seen her at the station, and so forth. Yet she had not mentioned the circumstance to him on either occasion; though when he had spoken of it, she had answered carelessly enough, 'Yes, I was in town yesterday,' in a manner which had not encouraged him to ask for further particulars.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303313">He was not very happy at that time. He did not think she cared anything about him; though he could not shut his eyes to the fact that she encouraged him, as much as a lady could do. At all manner of inconvenient and unexpected hours, too, the remembrance of Mademoiselle Mignon's little wan face recurred to him, in a way that made his ears tingle and his cheeks burn. Not that he ever heard her name mentioned. The only one of his brother officers who knew her name was Bootles, and during the past two months between Bootles and himself a barrier had risen up, which the one could not and the other would not break down. Outwardly, Bootles was the same, but <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303312" n="303     CONSCIENCE"/>he never entered Kerr's room now; he never called him 'Charlie' or by any of the odd terms of endearment soldiers are accustomed to apply to one another; least of all did he ever mention or allude in any way to the girl whom he had called 'Mademoiselle Mignon—the perfect little lady—so simple and true.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303314">December had set in, and half the fellows were on leave. Bathingtown was deserted, and many people wondered that the handsome widow, who made so few friends and seemed so entirely taken up with the tall lancer, stayed. 'Charlie's widow,' the fellows called her; and Charlie, hearing them, used to smile, wondering if she would ever consent to run the risk of becoming so.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303315">'I say, Charlie,' said one of the fellows to him one afternoon when he was on duty, 'I saw your widow this afternoon; she came down from town in the next carriage to me. Bootles was with her, and, 'pon my word! they seemed so awfully thick, I didn't like to get into the same carriage, though I was going to.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303316">'Bootles!' echoed Charlie blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303317">'Bootles,' the other repeated; 'and the widow was crying—crying like anything.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303318">It was inexplicable—Bootles and Mrs. Smith?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303319">The idea of the two together seemed as impossible to him as a union of fire and water. Why, he couldn't have said, for he had never heard either mention the other. He was, however, so astonished and so curious that he went into his old friend's room, a thing he had not done for weeks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303320">'I say, Bootles,' he said, entering.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303321">Bootles, who was lying in a big chair, smoking, looked up. 'Oh, is that you, Kerr?' with a sudden politeness that cut Charlie to the very heart; 'have a chair.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303322">'Have you been to town?' Charlie asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303323">'Yes, I have. Why?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303324">'I say, I didn't know you knew Mrs. Smith.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303325">'Didn't you? I've known her some time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303326">'Really. She was in town to-day also?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303327">'Yes'—looking straight into the fire; 'she's a very nice Woman—comes of a nice family.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303328">'What was she crying about to-day?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303329">'Who told you she was crying?'—turning to him sharply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303330">'Preston told me.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303331" n="304     CAVALRY LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303332">'Oh, Preston; he was in the train, then? It was some family trouble. Ask her yourself, to-morrow. I dare say she'll tell you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303333">'Oh, I'm sure she will,' returned Charlie, stung by the other's tone, and rising; 'well, it's time to dress.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303334">Accordingly, about five on the following afternoon, he went down to Mrs. Smith's house. The drawing-room was empty, but she came to him almost immediately. The awful change in her appearance struck Charlie instantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303335">'My own darling, what is it?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303336">She drew her hand away from the eager clasp of his, and sank on to a couch, pointing to a chair.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303337">But Charlie did not take it; he flung himself down at her feet, and, now that the flood-gates of his passions were opened, poured out the whole story of his love—his adoration—his abject worship—for her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303338">'Do you want me to marry you?' asked Mrs. Smith, in a very low voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303339">'My dearest, I have been wishing that ever since the day I first saw you,' he cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303340">'I have something to tell you'—with an evident effort.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303341">'I don't want to hear it.' He thought the confirmation of his suspicions was at hand. 'Nothing will make any difference in my love for you; I will hear nothing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303342">'You must.' She sat upright, and pushed the golden hair off her white forehead, with a weary gesture. 'I have told you that my maiden name was Bolitho.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303343">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303344">'My mother married again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303345">'You did not tell me that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303346">'Nevertheless, it is so. She married early. I was but a child—and she had two daughters.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303347">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303348">'The eldest of these two, whilst staying in Cornwall a few months ago, met with an officer, who fell in love with her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303349">'Yes!' He was becoming horribly interested by her story. 'Yes! And his name was——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303350">'Kerr—Charlie Kerr,' said Mrs. Smith.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303351">'Oh, God in heaven!' he gasped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303353">'I was always very fond of Rosey, and I took this house solely to give her the pleasure of being with you; in deference to her wishes, I did not mention the relationship between us, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303352" n="305     CONSCIENCE"/>when you were introduced to me. The child wished to surprise you by her sudden appearance here.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303354">'And—and——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303355">'And I ruined her life—all innocently. It never entered my mind you could have a false thought in your head, until I saw Rosey, the week after you jilted her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303356">'No! no!' he cried out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303357">'Jilted her,' Mrs. Smith repeated. 'I couldn't understand it; but when I met you, it suddenly became clear to me. From that moment I set myself to win your love—your heart—and I think I succeeded.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303358">'Yes! you succeeded,' he said, growing whiter and whiter each moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303359">'And do you think, Mr. Kerr'—her eyes all cold steel now—'that I shall be likely to answer "Yes" to your very flattering proposal?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303360">He did not speak at all, but slowly rose up to his feet, with a face like a statue of marble.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303361">'I have succeeded in punishing you,' the widow went on; 'but what will give me my little sister back?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303362">'I will! I have been a scoundrel, a cad, a brute, anything you like; but I am not altogether callous. She knows nothing of this; let me go back and make friends with her again; I know she will forgive me. You have dealt out justice to me with a merciless hand; be merciful now, and trust me to give my whole life for her happiness.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303363">'It is too late,' she answered; 'my sister died at noon yesterday.' Then she broke down altogether, and hid her face among the cushions of the sofa.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303364">For five minutes he stood watching her; then he went out of her house, like a man in a dream, to carry for his whole life the burden of an upbraiding conscience, which had tried so very, very hard in the days that were gone to keep all this misery from coming to pass.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303365">In his room Calvert was singing:</p><q><l>'"With loving lips and true gray eyes,</l><l>I call her my Rose Marie!</l><l>Over the hills and far away</l><l>Dwells my love, my Rose Marie."'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303366">The stick and gloves Kerr carried slipped from his fingers on to

Such an impression I had, however, not the smallest intention of giving to my readers.

Bob's will and pleasure being Mrs. Bob's law, she ordered her boxes to be packed, commended her babies to the care of Mrs. Jinks, and to town they went. Town was full, the weather was fine, town was charming, and altogether Bob and his wife had what the Americans call a good time of it; so that it was with regret that they took their places in the train for the North, notwithstanding that the nursery full of babies awaited them at the end of the journey, like a bright galaxy of stars; they really were lovely babies, all of them, with their mother's big, black, velvet-like eyes set in their father's handsome, regular face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303386">As soon as they were off, Bob settled down to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and Mrs. Bob, after her wont, proceeded to scrutinize her fellow-passengers.

He made Mrs. Bob think of a verse she had once read:</p><q><lg><l>'By the side of a murmuring stream</l><l>An elderly gentleman sat;</l><l>On the top of his head was his wig,</l><l>On the top of his wig was his hat.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303388">It <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a wig, crowned by a florid and hideous smoking-cap. He was very fat, so fat that he wobbled like a jelly—not a stiff jelly by any means. Mrs. Bob described him at once in her own mind as a London alderman, and thought pityingly of turtle-soup and green fat; true, she had never seen one of those dignitarie in the flesh that she knew of, and the old gentleman was no more an alderman than I, the writer of this story; but then, as he was just Mrs. Bob's ideal of one, he therefore became an instance of those who have greatness thrust upon them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303390">Opposite to him, and to Mrs. Bob herself, were two ladies, tall, thin, severe-looking, not to say vinegarish, of aspect. Mrs. Bob decided their walk of life with as little hesitation and as much accuracy as she had decided that of the old <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303389" n="313     UNDER THE CROWN"/>gentleman—they were schoolmistresses in a swell way of business, 'principals of an educational establishment.' Oh, how she pitied the poor girls in their charge—I very much fear Mrs. Bob thought <hi rend="italic">clutches</hi> — from the bottom of her kind and gentle heart! As a matter of fact, they were not in the educational line at all, but ladies of title—maiden, it is true—and social stars of great magnitude in their own neighbourhood. However, as Mrs. Bob did not know that, and probably would not have admired them any more if she had known it, she turned from them to look at the remaining occupant of the carriage. He was much more agreeable to contemplate; his profession did not need half an eye to discover: a clergyman, a clergyman of the Established Church, elderly, gray-haired, benevolent of aspect, and very gentle and kind-looking—'a dear old darling,' said Mrs. Bob within herself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303391">Just as she glanced at him, he bent slightly towards her, and asked if she would mind having the window a little open.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303392">'Not the very least in the world,' she answered graciously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303393">'In fact, I <hi rend="italic">like</hi> it open, if it is not <hi rend="italic">very</hi> cold weather.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303394">Very soon they slipped into conversation, and little Mrs. Bob was charmed by him—he was so polite, so courtly, so very pleasant. He offered her the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Illustrated</hi>, which Mrs. Bob accepted and glanced over. Bob, who had thrust those very papers into his bag half an hour before, grinned to himself under his moustaches and let them remain there. Then, the papers being exhausted, Mrs. Bob and the old parson fell back upon conversation, and very nicely did their conversation flourish. They talked about all manner of things, and when the two old ladies and the fat old gentleman got out, which they did at Peterborough and Grantham, he became a good deal more amusing, and made Mrs. Bob laugh so much that they quite glided into a mild flirtation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303395">As for Bob, he was unusually quiet, and Bob was not a great talker at any time. Once, indeed, so silent was he that his wife asked him if he had a headache; but he answered in the negative, and added that the story he was reading was particularly interesting So he read his book most of the way, and only joined enough in the conversation not to look sulky.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303397">'Twenty minutes more,' said Mrs. Bob, looking at her <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303396" n="314     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>watch, 'and we shall be at York; we change at York or Liliminster.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303398">'You go to Liliminster?' said the old parson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303399">'Yes; my husband's regiment is quartered there,' she replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303400">'Ah, I go a different way—on to Carlisle,' he said.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303401">'Oh, you live at Carlisle?' In truth, the little woman was longing to know where he did live, and what was his name, but did not quite like to put the questions plainly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303402">'Oh no; I live in London,' he answered. 'I am going to Carlisle for a couple of days on a matter of business.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303403">At this point Bob exploded—a smothered little snigger of a laugh, just loud enough for Mrs. Bob to hear, make her turn her big eyes upon him, and ask:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303404">'Why are you laughing, Bob?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303405">'Oh, this story is awfully amusing,' he answered promptly. As it happened, that portion of the story just before him described a heart-broken parting between a pair of heartbroken lovers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303406">However, satisfied by the reply, Mrs. Bob turned again to their fellow-traveller.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303407">'Oh, I thought your living might be at Carlisle,' she said.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303408">'My <hi rend="italic">living!'</hi> he repeated in a puzzled tone, which set Bob off laughing again. 'My <hi rend="italic">living</hi>, my dear lady! I am not a clergyman.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303409">'Oh, are you not?' in crestfallen tones. 'I made <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you were.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303410">'The fact is,' struck in Bob, 'my wife considers herself a great judge of character and physiognomy, and all that—says she has only to look at a man to tell his business at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303411">'My dear madam,' said the old gentleman in a very kind tone, 'I am afraid for once you are at fault. I am not a clergyman, I assure you. I hold a public office under the Crown.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303412">'Really, now. Well, I <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> thought you were a clergyman. How one may be mistaken!' she said in the pretty, childish way which seemed to attract everyone, and wondering what Bob could be laughing at. 'Oh, here we are at York.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303413">The old gentleman was very kind still; their train left in ten minutes, and he helped to carry some of her numerous parcels across the platform. Presently, when Bob brought his wife back from the refreshment-room, he helped her into the carriage.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303414" n="315     UNDER THE CROWN"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303415">'Good-bye,' she said, holding out her hand to him. 'You have been very kind to me; we have enjoyed your society very much. I hope we may meet again some day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303416">He took her hand as if it had been some fair and lovely thing, too sacred for common touch.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303417">'A great many people say good-bye to me,' he said rather wistfully; 'but they don't say they hope to meet me again.' Then the train moved; the old gentleman lifted his hat, Bob followed suit; Mrs. Bob smiled and waved her hand, and they had parted, the chance acquaintances of a few hours.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303418">'I wish he had told us his name,' she said regretfully. Bob slipped his arm round her waist.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303419">'Lily, my child,' he said gravely, but with laughter in his eyes, 'you don't know who he was?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303420">'No, Bob'—wonderingly; 'do you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303421">'I saw him once. As he told you, he holds a public office under the Crown, and his name is Cal——' but little Mrs. Bob uttered such a scream that the remainder of the word was lost, and Bob laughed too immoderately to repeat it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303422">For a few minutes she was utterly dismayed; then she pulled herself together and said she didn't believe it—but it was true, for all that.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_202" n="2" type="story"><head>THE COST OF A LIE.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_203" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303423">'I SAY, Dickson!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303424">'Yes, old chap; what is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303425">'Laurie's a good fellow, ain't he?'—with a great sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303426">'Yes, very. What are you sighing about?' As he spoke, Dickson hauled himself up from the depths of a big chair of basket-work, and went over to the side of the couch, from which Eliot Cardella could not lift himself. 'What's the matter?' he asked. 'Are you feeling worse?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303428">Dickson and Cardella, with Laurie and Gore, were sharing one of the largest bungalows in Khotah, and Cardella was slowly—very slowly—recovering from a severe attack of the much-dreaded Peshawur fever, to which he had fallen a victim on the march from Caubool, where the Cuirassiers had been quartered nearly a year, and whence they had but a few weeks <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303427" n="316     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>before returned. There had been many and awful changes in the regiment: there were many blanks in the roll now—many familiar faces missing; many had inherited a freehold 'six feet by three ' in the land of their enemies, and lay sleeping their last sleep as soundly under Afghan jasmine and orange-blossoms as if under English turf and daisies. The Colonel—our old friend Creyke, with a real V.C. after his name now— had gone up to the Murree Hills, with an empty sleeve and a frame reduced by fever to the lowest state at which a man could still live; several officers had gone home invalided, but of the four then living together, three had passed through the campaign unscathed, Cardella only being so unfortunate as to catch fever at Peshawur, on the return march to India.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303429">That Laurie ailed nothing, you could easily have believed, had you been in that huge shaded room, with its high white walls and ever-moving punkah, for he was smoking in the veranda at that moment, swaying himself idly to and fro in a big American rocking-chair and singing softly, with a mellow tenor voice, a poor little Christy melody, valueless as a musical composition and utterly worthless as a poem, yet a thing that had caught his fancy, perhaps because it reminded him of a pleasant Queen Anne house, buried among cherry and apple orchards, six thousand long weary miles away from where he was sitting.</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Way down upon de Swanee ribber,</l><l>Far, far away,</l><l>Dere's wha my heart is turning ebber,</l><l>Dere's wha de old folks stay.</l><l>All up and down de whole creation</l><l>Sadly I roam,</l><l>Still longing for de ole plantation,</l><l>And for de ole folks at home.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>'All round de little farm I wander'd,</l><l>When I was young,</l><l>Den many happy days I squander'd,</l><l>Many de songs I sung.</l><l>When I was playing wid my brudder,</l><l>Happy was I;</l><l>Oh, take me to my kind ole mudder,</l><l>Dere let me live and die.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303430">'What's the matter?' asked Dickson, who had not taken much notice of the singer or his song. 'Why are you sighing like that, old fellow?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303431" n="317     THE COST OF A LIE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303432">'I wish to Heaven he wouldn't sing. I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> stand it,' Eliot burst out fretfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303433">'"All de world am sad and weary,"' sang Laurie very much <hi rend="italic">con expressione</hi>, whereat Dickson strode out into the veranda and unceremoniously shook the rocking-chair and its occupant up—bringing Laurie back from his dreams of English cherry and apple orchards to a realization of things present and Indian.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303434">'Stop that, old chap,' said Dickson authoritatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303435">'What the devil's up?' Laurie asked, looking up at his comrade with astonished eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303436">'Cardella can't stand your yowling,' Dickson answered. 'I wish you would try to remember there's a sick man within hearing; you know he's been coughing every bit of the night enough to tear him in two.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303437">'I'm so sorry. I say, Cardella, old chap'—going within the room and to the side of the couch—' I forgot all about you. You see, it's so jolly to find one's self out of that beastly Afghanistan, one can't help feeling rather cheerful; and, you know, you never take any notice in a general way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303438">'No; I know. I'm not homesick in a general way; but oh, Lord! I'd give all I'm worth to find myself at the Castle this minute!' Then he added in a lower tone: ' I begin to feel, though, as if I never shall find myself there again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303439">'Oh, come, come, Eliot, old man, this won't do!' Dickson put in, with rough kindness. 'You've had a bad go of that beastly Peshawur fever, and you're seedy and down in the mouth yet; but you must not give in in this way. If you would only do as you are told, if you would only obey the orders Haines gives you, we should have you off the sick-list and up in the hills in a fortnight. But you know you won't, Cardella. You seem to think an empty sack will stand upright; but it won't, and it's no use trying to make it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303440">'Oh yes; I know—Haines comes in with his great roaring, healthy voice that goes through my head like a knife, and he says nothing but eat, eat, eat, till I'd like to choke him with his own prescription,' Cardella answered irritably, and moving his aching head restlessly from side to side. 'Nothing but eat, eat, eat! The ass might as well tell me not to cough!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303442">'Well now, look here, Eliot,' Dickson said persuasively. 'Here's a note and some jelly from Mrs. Hey. She's made <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303441" n="318     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>it herself, because she knows you don't fancy the native cooking. 'Pon my soul, I didn't think there was so much goodness in the woman! If she hadn't had a downright good heart of her own, she'd have pretended she hadn't the least idea how jelly was made. Just look at it! I did not disturb you before, because I thought you were asleep.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303443">As he spoke, he brought for Cardella's inspection a deep dish, wherein lay, reposing amongst lumps of ice, a heap of golden jelly, tempting enough to entice the poorest and most capricious appetite.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303444">'Eat it yourself,' said Cardella wretchedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303445">'Stuff and nonsense! you have to do that,' Dickson answered. 'I know you don't want it, but you've got to eat it. Remember, a lady made it for you, even if she is only a Quartermaster's wife, and may have been a cook to start with. All the luckier for you if she was, you ungrateful beggar!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303446">'I am not ungrateful, Dickson,' returned Cardella, with dignified fretfulness. 'It's devilish good of the little woman. Go this evening and tell her so; but eat the stuff I can't, and that's the long and the short of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303447">However, by dint of much persuasion, coaxing, bullying and arguing, Dickson and Laurie between them did manage to induce their patient to swallow a few bits of Mrs. Hey's jelly; and presently, when the heat of the day had gone off and Dickson had taken him for a drive, Laurie got on his pony and went round to the Quartermaster's bungalow to thank Mrs. Hey for her kindness and the trouble she had taken.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303448">'Yes, he has eaten some twice,' he told her. 'But he seems to have an utter distaste for food of any kind—can't swallow anything solid, and Haines won't let him have as many iced pegs as he would like. And then, poor chap! he not only coughs all night, but he's in miserable spirits and wretchedly homesick.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303450">'Poor fellow!' murmured the Quartermaster's little wife pityingly, 'I don't wonder at it. For my part, you may take the delights of living in India. Mrs. Newcombe used to rave about it as if it was a kind of paradise. She may think it very fine to have a dozen partners for every dance—men that wouldn't look at you at home—when you haven't energy to take two turns. I can't abide the nasty hole—nasty <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303449" n="319     THE COST OF A LIE"/>black servants sneaking about with their nasty bare feet. I'm sure I can't fancy eating anything they've touched with their nasty black fingers. In fact, I daren't go into the hole the cook calls his kitchen, or I should never eat aught he cooked again. In this country it's best to live on the principle of what the eye never sees the heart never grieves for. And she used to prate about the fruits—well, I know I'd rather have a pennyworth of the commonest pears out of Blankhampton Market than all the fruits I've seen in India yet.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303451">'Yes, you're right, Mrs. Hey,' Laurie answered, laughing. 'It's a beastly hole, no mistake about it; all the same, it's a perfect paradise compared with Afghanistan.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303452">'So Joe says—he calls that a place where there's more reason to cry or swear than anything else. Must you go?'— as Laurie rose. 'Your ride! Well, we were going for a drive ourselves, so I'll not press you to stay. Good-night, and tell Mr. Cardella I hope he'll soon pull round.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303453">'Yes, I'll tell him,' Laurie called out, as he rode off". 'Good-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303454">Meantime Dickson and Cardella were returning from their drive, and Dickson was saying, 'You're better, Eliot, ever so much; we've driven twice as fast as we did last week.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303455">'Yes; I shall pull through, I dare say,' he answered indifferently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303456">'I can't tell what's come to you lately,' his friend went on. 'Independently of this fever, you're very much altered.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303457">'Men do alter,' said Cardella briefly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303458">'You're not hankering after that girl at Blankhampton?'—looking down at him searchingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303459">Cardella burst into a laugh—a laugh that was very scornful, though it was so weak and ended in a paroxysm of coughing. He made no other reply, and Dickson asked no further questions; yet he knew, as well as if Eliot Cardella had told him so, that he had left his heart behind him in England, and had not brought one away with him in exchange for it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303461">Later in the evening, he sat alone in the veranda, puffing at a gigantic meerschaum, and wondering—wondering chiefly why women-folks should be so utterly inexplicable. There was Cardella, as handsome and as winning a fellow as might he found in a day's march—the son of an Earl, with plenty <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303460" n="320     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>of money, and not yet thirty years old. It seemed beyond all reason that any woman should have refused him, or, supposing matters not to have gone so far as that, have passed him by for another. He did not wonder that Polly Antrobus— 'that girl at Blankhampton'—had loosened her hold of him to fly at higher game which <hi rend="italic">seemed</hi> to be within her grasp; she had been influenced by vanity, ambition, and the counsels of her grasping worldly-minded parents; Eliot had been regularly let in in the first place, and in their turn the biters had been bitten. All that was simple enough; but this—this entire change of the man's whole nature—this terrible home-sickness, coupled with a refusal to accept home-leave, did puzzle Dickson tremendously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303462">'Always a woman at the bottom of it all,' he muttered to the meerschaum.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303463">And then his thoughts flew back to that dead and gone romance of his own, when he had hoped to cut the army altogether, and retire into private life in a country-house, the mistress of which should be tall and fair and stately—the mistress of which should be Nell Vansittart, who had refused him for the sake of a man who had jilted her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303464">How wretched he had been! He stretched his long legs out, with a feeling of comfortable triumph that he could never be so entirely wretched again—no, not even if fifty Nell Vansittarts should say him nay. The old love was quite dead and gone—it could never rise up to trouble him any more—yet how utterly wretched he had been; he remembered, with microscopic distinctness, the exact state of his feelings during the first weeks of his disappointment—how Gore had very nearly driven him mad by what he called his 'song':</p><q><l>'Oh, my Jem—Jemima!</l><l>She's left her loving Sa—am,</l><l>And gone to be a Mormonite</l><l>In New Jer—u—sa—lem!'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303466">Gore was at it yet. After five years the fellows had not grown weary of hearing, nor he of singing it. He just mounted a chair now, as he had done any time the last ten years, and see-sawed his arms up and down in the ' fearless old fashion,' like a windmill suddenly gone crazy or drunk. He had heard him sing it on board the <hi rend="italic">Jumna;</hi> he had heard him sing it in the railway-carriage on the road to Unapore; he 
<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303465" n="321     THE COST OF A LIE"/>had heard it at Simla, in the classic precincts of the Khyber Pass, among the roses and jasmine blooms of the Ameer's garden at Jellalabad, in the Bala Hissar itself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303467">'I shouldn't wonder if he isn't singing it down at the mess at this moment.' Dickson said to himself with a contemptuous laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303468">Then his thoughts went back to Eliot Cardella. He couldn't help wondering what it was that had changed him so awfully. The regiment had been out three years. Long and Laurie had been left with the depot; then Martin and Cardella had taken it. After rather more than a year's absence, he had returned to his regiment as a Captain, and they had been ordered to Afghanistan almost immediately, where they remained nearly a year; he had noticed the change in Cardella at once.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303469">'Whatever it was, it took place whilst he was with the depot. Poor chap! he's had it bad; <hi rend="italic">I</hi> got over it entirely in less than three months.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303470">Then his attention was diverted, for Laurie came out into the veranda, and settled himself in a big chair near Dickson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303471">'Cardella's off to sleep at last,' he announced; 'his bearer has just told me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303472">'That's good, if the cough doesn't awake him, poor chap! I say, Laurie!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303473">'Ye—es,' said Laurie, holding his pipe between his teeth, and striking a fusee.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303474">'What sort of people are there at Canterbury?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303475">'What sort of people?' Laurie repeated, turning his head to peer at his friend through the darkness. 'What sort of people? Oh, the usual ruck—Church dignitaries and army fellows, and#x2014;and#x2014;a few women, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303476">'What sort of women?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303477">'Hey?' peering through the darkness again, and speaking in a sharp but puzzled tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303478">'Any women a man would be likely to fall in love with?' Dickson continued by way of explanation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303479">'Why, are you thinking of asking for the depot?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303480">'Not I. You forget I shall most likely get the majority of the White Dragoons.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303482">'Oh yes, so they say. Well, what do you want to know about the Canterbury women? I tell you there was the usual <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303481" n="322     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>ruck—the De Courcy-Joneses, the Kensington-Smiths, the Parkinson-Browns, and—and—there was Miss Ross.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303483">'And what was Miss Ross like?' Dickson asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303484">'Miss Ross? Oh, she was a brunette.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303485">'Good style?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303486">'Oh, devilish!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303487">'Any money? Was she a lady?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303488">'Not a penny. I believe her father had been in the army—in fact, I'm sure of it. By Jove! but she was a beauty!' sending a great sigh of regret out into the night air along with the tobacco smoke. 'In fact, Dickson, if I hadn't been such a miserably poor devil as I am, I believe I should have asked Miss Ross to marry me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303489">'Ah, I see,' said Dickson comprehensively, while to himself he said, 'That's the woman;' and then he asked, 'Why on earth did she refuse Eliot?'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_204" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303490">IT was winter—an Indian one, of course, yet nearly as pleasant to the burnt-up Cuirassiers as the same season in England—weather so deliciously cool that they could wear their ordinary English clothes, needed fires at morn and eventime, and used fur rugs on their beds just as they had been accustomed to do in their mother country.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303491">Laurie and Cardella were by themselves at their bungalow, Dickson and Gore being both on leave—Dickson on short leave, owing to a sprained foot, Gore indefinitely, with an affection of the liver, brought on, Dickson declared, by persistent see-sawing up and down of his arms, which, as I have said, was his idea of accompaniment to his solitary song.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303492">Cardella had had a long leave, spent among the gaieties of Simla, where he had given up sighing and had taken to <hi rend="italic">safe</hi> flirtation, and very sincerely repented himself of his foolishness in refusing the home-leave which had been offered to him at the close of his service in Afghanistan. In health he was much improved, having almost got rid of the Peshawur fever, which only returned now and again in mild attacks when he happened to get in the way of a chill.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303494">The European mails were just in, so Laurie and Cardella had been occupied all day, each having had a goodly budget of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303493" n="323     THE COST OF A LIE"/>letters and newspapers, which had kept them amused from noon till dinner-time. Then they had gone to mess, and now were lounging in front of an immense fire of sweet-smelling wood, smoking, while they discussed the home news.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303495">'Fancy, Snipes married!' said Laurie with a laugh, naming the officer then in command of the depot. 'Just fancy old Snipes getting married!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303496">'No, I cannot fancy Snipes married,' returned Cardella solemnly; ' I'll be hanged if I can. Poor old chap! I wonder if he's converted her to spiritualism yet?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303497">'Not he; he's married her under the impression she's a medium of the first water. Take my word for it, Jakey Smith didn't need any conversion; she'd go in for the whole spiritualistic humbug hot and strong, as soon as ever she heard Snipes was touched in that quarter. She tried excessive horsiness on me. Did you ever see Jakey on horseback?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303498">'No'—laughing at Laurie's manner. 'What was the effect?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303499">'The effect? Well, it was odd—very odd. You see, Jakey had rather a pretty sort of face, but no shape to speak of—had a kind of idea, I fancy, from the way she showed it, that her tailor could make her one. Now, between you and me, a powder-box and a dash of paint will go a long way towards making a pretty face, particularly when there's a veil over it; but as for a made-up shape—oh, Lord! it's very seldom a tailor manages to make it look "natteral"; and when he does, it's just an achievement he ought to be horsewhipped for accomplishing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303500">'And Jakey Smith—oh, I beg her pardon, <hi rend="italic">Ken-sing-ton</hi>-Smith, with three hyphens to make sure of it, eh?' Cardella laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303501">'Yes. Well, you see, Jakey had one of that sort of shapes that stick out on the wrong side of her, as if her head wanted turning round and putting on the other way. Well, her tailor, not being used to such a delicate operation, tried to remedy it by putting plenty of cotton-wool on the flat side, and Jakey supplemented his efforts by stuffing in plenty of pocket-handkerchiefs. Naturally, the effect was a curve on both sides, and the <hi rend="italic">tout ensemble</hi> certainly was very funny—seen on horseback.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303502">'I should think so'—with a great laugh at the description.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303503">'What dodge did she try on with you?' Laurie continued.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303504">'With me? Nothing.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303505" n="324     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303506">'Nothing, by George! But you don't mean to say the celebrated Jakey didn't have so much as a shot at you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303507">'Why, she did rather hint at being so awfully fond of horses,' Cardella answered; 'but I didn't think she meant riding mine. You see, I'd never seen her on horseback, so it didn't occur to me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303508">'It wouldn't, naturally,' Laurie replied. 'Did you ever see Miss Ross on horseback? Did you know her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303509">'Yes; I knew her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303510">'Pretty girl,' Laurie went on. 'Very pretty girl, wasn't she?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303511">'Awfully handsome'—with a sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303512">'Different to all the Browns, and Smiths, and Joneses, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303513">Cardella laughed, and Laurie continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303514">'Ah, if I'd been a rich fellow, which I'm not, I rather think I should have gone in for Miss Ross. I don't suppose she'd have had me, though.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303515">'I am sure she would,' said Cardella steadily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303516">'The devil you are—what makes you think so?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303517">'She as good as told me so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303518">'The devil she did!' He was so thoroughly surprised that his vocabulary all at once grew limited. 'Are you sure, Cardella?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303519">'Quite sure,' Cardella answered quietly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303520">'Well, upon my word, you never know what women will or won't be up to next! One thing's very certain: they're the queerest beggars out!' Laurie remarked, his astonishment in nowise lessened.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303521">A pang of pain shot through Cardella's heart. It did seem hard that the girl he loved should have preferred before him such a man as Laurie, who, right good fellow that he was, had neither reverence nor chivalry in his composition; it made him positively sick to hear her classed with all her sex in a lump as 'the queerest beggars out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303522">'I should have thought you were much more likely to take her fancy than an ordinary-looking chap like me,' Laurie went on, in very heart-whole tones. 'I should think if you had put the question to her plump she'd have given my memory the go-by quickly enough.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303523">'So I did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303524">'You did? Lord bless me! I wouldn't have believed it from anyone but yourself. Cardella, are you quite sure?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303525" n="325     THE COST OF A LIE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303526">I'm quite sure, Laurie.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303527">'But what the devil did she see in me? I never made love to her in my life. I might have been engaged to a dozen women, for anything she knew to the contrary. As a matter of fact, I kept out of it, for I knew I should probably never be able to marry a wife who couldn't bring some money with her; and as Miss Ross was as poor as myself, I thought it best and safest in the long-run to keep on the right side of the hedge. But, I say, Cardella, how do you know she was thinking of me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303528">'I tell you she as good as told me so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303529">'It's most extraordinary—'pon my soul, it is!' Laurie went on, in greater astonishment than ever. 'What could she have been thinking of—a poor devil like me, without a sixpence to bless himself with? Well, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> ever I come in for a fortune, I must go and ask Miss Ross to share it; but I'm afraid the contingency is a very remote one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303530">'More unlikely things have come about,' said Cardella absently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303531">'Oh yes! quite so. I have a fabulously rich godfather knocking about somewhere or other. He never did anything for me yet, not so much as a mug; but Heaven only knows what freaks he may not take into his head. I dare say, though, by the time he has left me a fortune, Miss Ross will be transformed into Mrs. Somebody or other, and will have forgotten I ever existed. I wish she had taken you, though perhaps your people mightn't have liked it. Did your brother see her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303532">'Yes, he did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303533">'Did he admire her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303534">'Oh, immensely!'—laughing at the remembrance of it. 'In fact, I thought it was all right till he turned up; and then, just as I thought he was going to cut me out, as he did with Polly Antrobus, all this about you came to light.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303535">'And how did it come to light?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303537">'Well, the fact was, I began to think Cardella was getting serious, so I asked her flat out if she'd have me. And she told me honestly she'd given her heart away. I asked if she was engaged, and she said "No." And then I asked her if it was anyone I knew, and she said "Yes." And I guessed you directly, because I knew there was no one else likely. She blushed awfully, and didn't say anything; but the last <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303536" n="326     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>time I saw her, before we left Canterbury, she said: "Take care of Mr. Laurie;" and I told her I would if I could.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303538">'Bless my soul!' ejaculated Laurie, who didn't believe a word of it, and imagined his friend was solemnly taking a rise out of him, or that Miss Ross was doing the same to Eliot Cardella.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303539">Believe it?—not he. 'Depend upon it,' he said to himself, after he had turned into bed that night, 'the little devil's up to worse mischief—got a bigger fish to land! Lost her heart to me—a very likely story! Got a bigger fish to land, so put Cardella off with that humbugging tale—unless, indeed, Cardella made it up as he went on. And yet it told like truth, and I shouldn't wonder if she did tell him so. All the same, I don't believe a word of her losing her heart in my direction; I'd not believe it if she swore it. And I doubt very much if Cardella really proposed, and I have no doubt whatever about her refusing him. 'Tisn't in reason—why, she'd simply have jumped at him.'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_205" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303540">A FEW days later Dickson came back from his short leave, to Eliot Cardella's great delight.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303541">The two were close friends, though there was five years' difference in their ages. They suited each other, and, though Cardella was very good friends with both Laurie and Gore, he was never quite so well satisfied with the companionship of either of them as he was with Dickson's.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303542">'It's so jolly to have you back,' he told him, over their first smoke. 'What have you been doing? Tell me all about everything.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303543">'And what have you been doing?' asked Dickson in reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303544">'I-oh, the usual thing—work—lunch—bye-bye—dinner —drive—smoke to wind up with,' Cardella answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303546">'Oh, I didn't mean here! You can't get into much mischief in Khotah; that's quite out of the question; unless, indeed, you went in for Mrs. Long or one of the staff ladies, which you're not likely to do. No; I meant up at Simla there'—jerking his thumb towards the hills. 'I've about fifty messages for you — all from married ladies, too—but unfortunately they've all got jumbled up together. I wish I'd written them all down. And, oh, by-the-by, I met a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303545" n="327     THE COST OF A LIE"/>fellow called Forde—a splendid fellow, just out to join the Queen's Dragoons from the Red Lancers at Blankhampton; and what do you think the fair Polly has been and gone and done?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303547">'How should I know?' said Cardella, opening his eyes very widely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303548">'Been and gone and got married,' Dickson announced.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303549">'Nothing more likely; if my brother hadn't cut me out, I dare say I should have married her myself. Well, and who has she married?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303550">'She's married a German Jew chap,' Dickson returned; 'and Forde says he is, without any exception, the ugliest little devil he ever saw in the whole course of his life—black and sallow and bald, with yellow teeth like a horse, very shaky about his pins, and old enough to be Polly's papa.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303551">Cardella closed his eyes, and kept them shut.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303552">'It's enough to make one sick,' he murmured.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303553">'Yes, rather a descent,' Dickson laughed. 'Eliot Cardella to start with; then a Viscount, with an earldom in prospective. And to come down, after all, to a German Jew!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303554">'Enough to make one sick,' repeated Eliot Cardella scornfully; 'after—<hi rend="italic">me</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303555">Dickson laughed again, and just then Laurie came quietly in and settled himself in a big chair, without speaking.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303556">'What's the matter, Laurie?' Dickson asked, looking at him keenly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303557">'Oh, nothing! I've got a devil of a headache, that's all,' Laurie answered. 'Don't mind me—go on jawing. I like to hear it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303558">'I wonder whatever Laurie would do without his Satanic Majesty as a universal adjective,' cried Cardella with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303559">'It's a bad habit I've got into,' said Laurie, clasping his hands at the back of his head and staring up at the ceiling; 'I must try and get off it, for it don't always fit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303561">'No, by Jove, that's true!' cried Cardella, laughing again. 'We'd such a joke the other night, Dickson. There's been a Bishop and his wife staying at the chaplain's, and the other night there was a big dinner to meet them—everybody there, pretty nearly. Of course it was precious slow, and conversation was tolerably bald; so imagine the position when, in the middle of a dead silence, Mrs. Bishop suddenly tackled Laurie and informed him she was his godmother—said it, too, as if it <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303560" n="328     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>was a fact lie ought to be inordinately proud of. Laurie was so astonished he blurted out, "The devil you are!" Gad that woman's face was a study! I say, Laurie, is your head very bad?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303562">'Awfully bad!' he answered. 'I'll be off to roost and leave you two; you can tell me any extra good jokes in the morning.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303563">'I believe he's going to be ill,' said Dickson, as Laurie stumbled away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303564">'Oh, it's this beastly climate!' rejoined Cardella promptly. 'Of course you know Hey is down with typhoid?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303565">'No; really?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303566">'Really. Has it bad, and it's doubtful if he'll pull through, after drinking like a fish for ten years or more. I should say it will go hard with him. I wonder if Laurie's been fooling round about their place? I send morning and evening to ask after him, for the little woman was awfully good when I was ill, but I don't see the good of going myself. I can't be of any use to either of them; and, besides, I've never quite shaken off that Peshawur souvenir, and I don't suppose I ever shall.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303567">'You ought to have gone home.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303568">'Yes, I know. I wish I had; but I was miserable and down on my luck then, and I simply hadn't the heart to, and that's the truth. I'd go now, if I had the chance, sharp enough.'
<q><l>'"that will not when he may,</l><l>When he will, he shall have nay,"'</l></q>
quoted Dickson with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303569">'That is so. Well, have you no other news—nothing else to tell about the people up at Simla?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303570">'Well, I made the acquaintance of a lady called Vasher— Mrs. Anthony Vasher,' said Dickson deliberately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303571">'Oh, did you, though? Well?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303572">'Well?'—copying Cardella's tone. 'And Mrs. Anthony Vasher was a very pretty woman—that is, if you admire that type—red and brown.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303573">'I do. I admired her immensely; and, besides, she was very like a lady I knew at home.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303574">'Miss Ross, of Canterbury, I suppose,' said Dickson carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303575">Cardella looked startled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303576">'What do you know about Miss Ross, Dickson?' he asked. 'Who told you anything about her?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303577" n="329     THE COST OF A LIE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303578">'Well, it was a fellow called Smith, of the Horse Artillery. He told me Mrs. Anthony Vasher was remarkably like a Miss Ross, of Canterbury.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303579">'Did he know her? Miss Ross, I mean.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303580">'Yes; I fancy rather well.' Dickson replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303581">He did not think it necessary to say that, suspecting Miss Ross to be the lady who had made such a change in Cardella, he had quietly pumped the man called Smith of all he knew concerning her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303582">'What did he say about her? Tell me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303583">Dickson looked up coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303584">'Do you know her very well, Cardella?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303585">'Yes; what did he say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303586">'Oh, I'd rather not tell you, since she's a friend of yours. I wish I hadn't mentioned it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303587">'Dickson, do tell me. Miss Ross is nothing, and never will be anything, to me. She never cared a button for me; but I want to know.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303588">'Well, if you will, I suppose you will,' Dickson answered slowly. 'He said she was the d——dest little jilt he'd ever come across in the whole course of his life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303589">'Pooh!' Cardella exclaimed scornfully; 'I suppose that means she refused him. I don't wonder—a man called Smith.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303590">'Oh, very likely; I thought so myself at the time. He was a very decent-looking chap, though—but badly off.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303591">'Did he tell you anything else?' Cardella demanded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303592">'Oh, I forget—I altogether forget,' Dickson replied, wishing devoutly he had held his tongue from the beginning. 'How can I pretend to remember a lot of idle talk about a woman I never saw, and don't ever want to see? Why, he used to send me off to sleep very nearly every night with his everlasting talkee-talkee.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303593">'But what else did he say?' Cardella persisted, seeing from Dickson's manner that he did not choose to remember, or at least repeat it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303594">'Oh, I forget. Talk about something else.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303595">'But I want to know——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303596">'I tell you I forget. If I could remember and repeat all Smith's drivelling rot, I should be more fit to go into a lunatic asylum, and stop there, than to remain in the Cuirassiers. Heaven knows, it was bad enough to hear it at first-hand, without having it all over again at second.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303597" n="330     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303598">But Cardella was not to be put off in that way; he knew Dickson as well as he knew himself, and in spite of the vociferous protestations to the contrary, he perceived very clearly that whatever ' drivelling rot' the man called Smith might or might not have talked, Dickson had <hi rend="italic">not</hi> forgotten it, and it was something which pretty closely concerned Cardella himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303599">'When did he come out?' he asked abruptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303600">'Oh, the beginning of the year,' Dickson answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303601">Cardella was more determined to get at the truth than ever, and Dickson was equally determined not to tell it. But Cardella had been a spoilt child always, accustomed to have his own way all his life; so, though he held his peace for the moment, he by no means abandoned his determination to hear what the man called Smith had said. In fact, that night, when Dickson had been in bed half an hour, and was already asleep, Cardella went unceremoniously into his room, and said:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303602">'Dickson!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303603">'Hey! What's up?' asked Dickson, starting up from his pillows.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303604">'What was it that Smith chap said?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303605">'Now, look here, Cardella, this won't do. Just go out of my bedroom, will you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303606">'Dickson——' Cardella began persuasively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303607">'Do you want a boot tossed at your head, or do you not?' Dickson asked, feeling over the side of the low bed for something to shy at the intruder.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303608">'Dickson, will you tell me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303609">'No, I won't!' Dickson returned promptly. 'Get out of this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303610">'But, Dickson——' he began; then he had to dodge one boot, and then another. Then Dickson asked satirically, was he going to stop there all night?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303611">'Only until you tell me,' Cardella replied doggedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303612">Dickson groaned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303613">'O Lord, these women! what a curse they are! What's the good of stirring up muddy water?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303614">'Will you tell me, Dickson?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303615">'Won't you go away without?' Dickson was desperately sleepy, and hated having his rest broken.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303616">'No, I won't,' said Cardella flatly.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303617" n="331     THE COST OF A LIE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303618">'Then I'll tell you; and if you don't like it, you needn't break my head over it. He said your brother Cardella was coming and going pretty often; and if Miss Ross didn't catch him, it wouldn't be for want of trying. There, are you satisfied now?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303619">Cardella turned and walked out of the room without saying a word.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303620">I expect that was a facer for him, poor chap!' said Dickson to himself, as he laid his head on his pillow again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303621">But just as he was dropping off to sleep for the second time, Cardella came in again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303622">'I say, Dickson.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303623">Dickson began to lose his temper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303624">'What the devil is it now?' he asked irritably.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303625">'I don't believe a word of it—it's a d——d lie!' Cardella announced, in a tone of dogged triumph.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303626">'Go to Jericho!' returned Dickson politely; 'and look here, my friend, if you come into my room again with your tomfoolery, I'll just get up and kick you out of it;' but Cardella was gone, and Dickson settled himself among his pillows with an angry shake and a still more angry 'O Lord, these women! what an everlasting curse they are!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303627">However, settle himself as he would, Dickson found he couldn't go to sleep; he tossed restlessly to and fro during the whole night, desperately sleepy, yet unable to sleep for the jumble of Mrs. Anthony Vasher, Miss Ross, Cardella, and the man called Smith, which filled his head, the result of which was that he rose in about as bad a temper as Cardella or anyone else had ever seen him in. And the worst of it all was that Cardella had the cheek to laugh at him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303628">'Oh, you may laugh,'Dickson told him in warning accents; 'but don't try it on again, my friend, that's all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303629">'I say, Dickson.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303630">'Well, what is it now?'—crossly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303631">'Well, it's just this. Scott Laurie is very ill this morning—no mistake about it—and I've sent for Haines to come at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303632">'You don't say so?'—the vexation fading out of his face. 'Then you'd better clear out of this at once; if it's typhoid, and you take it, you won't have a chance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303633">'We don't know that typhoid, but I shall stay here, in any case'.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303634" n="332     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303635">'You'll do nothing of the kind. I shall tell Haines to send you away.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303636">'I shouldn't go for fifty Haineses,' Cardella answered. 'And, besides, it mayn't be typhoid at all; and if it were, do you suppose, Dickson, that I'm such a coward that I should run away from it, after he stayed by me as he did? Besides, there are other reasons why, if he is going to be really ill, I should stay and do the best I could for him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303637">'I'll tell you what it is, Cardella, my friend,' said Dickson vexedly: 'you're very fond of asking my advice, but I never knew you take it yet.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303638">'Dickson, if I were sickening for typhoid, would you immediately run away from me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303639">'No, of course I should not; but, then, I have not had a serious go of Peshawur fever.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303640">'And if you had had?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303641">'I shouldn't dream of running the risk you propose,' said Dickson decidedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303642">'Oh yes, you would, even if it killed you; and so shall I. All the same, Laurie may merely have one of his sick headaches. Any way, it's no use worrying about it before Haines has seen him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303643">However, when Dr. Haines had seen Laurie, he ordered Cardella to look for fresh quarters forthwith.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303644">'It mayn't be, but I think it is,' he said; 'and you, Cardella, are in no state to risk anything;' at which Cardella laughed, and stayed where he was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303645">In vain did Dickson and the doctor remonstrate with him; by Scott Laurie's bedside he remained, with a resolution which, after a few days, Dickson, knowing him well, gave up combating; and between them they brought their comrade back from the very gates of death—nearer to death itself than most men can go and live. But it was only after a month of incessant care and anxiety that Dr. Haines pronounced the patient out of danger, and told Cardella seriously that he might relax his efforts and take care of himself, that he had been the means of saving his friend's life, and that, if no unlooked-for relapse took place, he would live. It was too late to bid Cardella take precaution for himself; as Laurie, after three weeks of almost incessant delirium, came slowly back to a consciousness of who and where he was, Cardella sickened, and sank rapidly into the depths of extreme illness.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303646" n="333     THE COST OF A LIE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303647">Dickson was almost beside himself, and poor Laurie, when the news was blurted out to him by an indiscreet Hindoo, lay in his bed, a gaunt, white-faced skeleton, and cried weakly, until a relapse came on which very nearly brought his weakness and his suffering to a close; and by the time he had struggled back to life again, with a very indistinct idea that something had happened to somebody—he was not very sure who or when or where, but, half remembering that it was Cardella, asked if Cardella was all right—he thought, from Dickson's grave face, that Cardella was not only ill, but in the very greatest danger.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303648">'Wasn't he taken ill? Didn't Satan'—he had named his bearer Satan from the day he entered his service—'didn't Satan tell me he'd taken the fever from me?' he asked in his pitiably weak, childish voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303649">Dickson's words reassured him. 'Cardella's all right now. Don't worry yourself about anything; what you have to do is to obey orders and get well, and then we'll send you off to the hills.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303650">'Did Hey pull through? Hey was ill too, wasn't he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303651">'Oh yes; he's been at Simla a fortnight,' Dickson answered, with a great assumption of cheerfulness. 'And the little woman has written ever so many times to know how you are.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303652">'Very kind of her,' closing his eyes and uttering a great sigh of satisfaction. 'And I'm awfully glad Cardella pulled through; I was afraid.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303653">If he had been looking at him, he could not but have seen the spasm of pain which passed over Dickson's face; but then, as I said, his eyes were closed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303654">'You two saved my life'—putting out a wasted, trembling hand to touch Dickson's strong one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303655">'Cardella did that,' said Dickson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303656">'Yes; I believe I pretty nearly lived leaning on his broad shoulder. But you were there too. Dickson, it was awfully good of you both.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303657">'Nonsense! nonsense! Go to sleep now, and don't worry!' returned Dickson hastily. Then he went away and left him alone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303658">Laurie was soon enough asleep, and slept a peaceful, refreshing slumber for a couple of hours; then, just at sunset, he awoke with a start.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303659"><hi rend="italic">What was that?</hi></p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303660" n="334     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303661">He tried to lift himself upon his elbow, but he could not; he tried to call out, but the words died in his throat. So he lay unable to move, trembling violently in every limb, listening. Listening to what? To something that was taking place in the next room—Cardella's room—<hi rend="italic">what?</hi> He could hear a hushed scuffling, an unusual treading of feet-spurred heels, he would swear; then a scuffling again, and the sound of a voice that said, '<hi rend="italic">Hush!</hi>' What did it mean?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303662">'Dickson!' he called at last—'Dickson!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303663">His bearer (Satan) ran hastily in, and, seeing that he was horribly excited, fetched Dickson, who came to him treading softly, holding sword and sabretasche away from floor and leg, and trying to lessen the jingle of his spurred heels upon the floor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303664">'What is it, old man?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303665">'What are they doing in Cardella's room?' Laurie gasped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303666">Dickson set his face like stone, but after an instant's hesitation he spoke in his usual cheery tones.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303667">'My dear chap, we hoped to have managed it without waking you; we thought we shouldn't disturb you at all. They are taking Cardella away—to—a—better—climate—as we shall take you, if you behave yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303668">'Oh, my God, what a fright!' Laurie groaned, passing his shaking hand across his eyes. 'I—I—thought he was dead, Dickson—I did indeed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303669">'Your nerves are all to smash, old man—that's about it, Dickson answered soothingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303670">Then Laurie opened his eyes again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303671">'Why are you in full-dress, Dickson? and you have a crape on your arm! You're not deceiving me?'—looking at him with anxious eyes that seemed twice too big for his wasted face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303672">'Did I ever deceive you?' Dickson asked. 'Poor young Cartwright, of the 70th, died last night of heart disease, and I'm going to the funeral. Poor lad, he just closed his in the middle of dinner, and was gone in a minute.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303674">'Poor lad—poor lad!' murmured Laurie. He forgot Cardella then, and thought only about the dead lad, who had gone in a minute. He lay listening to the solemn strains of the 'Dead March,' half vacantly, half realizing the narrow escape he had had of its being played for him. Then the muffled boom of the drum brought Cardella into his mind again. 'If I hadn't <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303673" n="335     THE COST OF A LIE"/>called out to Dickson, this would have killed me,' he said to himself. 'I should have been certain it was Cardella.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303675">At that very moment Dickson was standing beside two open graves—Cardella's and that of the lad called Cartwright, who had gone in a moment—wondering if God would forgive him for the lies his lips had just uttered. And as he stared, with dry, miserable eyes, into the depths wherein he had laid his best friend, the men gathered round about whispered to one another that they wouldn't have believed poor old Dickson could be so cut up—though, of course, Cardella and he had been inseparable friends ever since the day the latter had joined the regiment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303676">Then they all trooped off, and Dickson had to go back to his bungalow to face a dreadful blank, to gather Cardella's belongings together, to write the last dreadful details to Lady Mallinbro'; worst of all, to sit hour after hour with Laurie, to hear Cardella's name upon his lips fifty times in the course of a day, to answer his questions day after day as best he could, and wonder how systematic liars contrive to get through the world at all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303677">And then there came a day when he was obliged to tell Laurie the truth—to tell him that Cardella had sacrificed his life for him—the day when Laurie was carried into the adjoining room, and wondered cheerfully if, when he was able to move, he hadn't better go straight to join Cardella.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303678">'And by-the-by, Dickson,' he ended, 'you never told me whether he went to Murree or Simla.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303679">Dickson pushed his chair back into the shadow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303680">'To neither,' he said, in a very low voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303681">'No! where, then?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303682">'Where he will never have fever of any kind any more,' Dickson answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303683">'Dead!'—incredulously—'not dead?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303684">Dickson bent his head in silence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303685">'Oh, God in heaven!' groaned the other, then burst out lobbing like a child.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303686">As for Dickson, he rose from his chair and wandered up and down the big room restlessly, trying hard to keep himself from breaking down, as his comrade, reduced in strength to the level of a child, had done.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303688">'He gave me my life at the cost of his own. What had I ever done that he should have sacrificed himself like this? <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303687" n="336     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>What value was my poor life, that his should be given for it? Why didn't you send him away? I hadn't my senses to tell him to keep away from me. What could I do, a poor devil off his head for weeks together? You know how he had been weakened by that beastly Peshawur fever, and that there wasn't a chance for him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303689">'I did my best,' Dickson answered; ' but you know, Laurie, as well as I do, what an unbending nature Cardella's was. I argued and stormed and entreated. I might as well have tried to move a mountain. You had done your best for him, he said; he would do the same by you—it was his duty. I could more easily have pulled this bungalow down with my own hands, than have moved Eliot from what he believed to be his duty. And, besides, he was not only thinking of your life, but of her happiness.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303690">'Her happiness! —whose?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303691">'This Miss Ross you were both in love with.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303692">'Miss Ross—in love—<hi rend="italic">I!</hi>' Laurie cried incredulously. 'In love—<hi rend="italic">I!</hi> I tell you, Dickson, I would have let fifty Miss Rosses die rather than one Eliot Cardella.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303693">'Then, you're not really in love with her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303694">'In love!'—scornfully—'<hi rend="italic">I!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303695">'But she cares for you, so Cardella saved your life for her happiness; she told him to take care of you, and so he did to the end.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303696">'I tell you the girl cared no more for <hi rend="italic">me</hi>——'Laurie began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303697">'Well, she told him she did, and he believed her,' Dickson interrupted. 'He has left you what property he had of his own—some five or six hundred a year—that you may go home and marry her at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303698">'It is too horrible!' Laurie broke out. 'Dickson, did he tell you all this?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303699">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303700">'And when? Was it when he was ill?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303701">'He made his will before he left England, as soon as he knew she liked you—or <hi rend="italic">said</hi> she did'—correcting himself bitterly. 'As for the rest, he told me, the last time he recognised me, I was to tell you to give her his love and his blessing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303703">'It is too horrible!' Laurie cried again, in a voice of anguish. ' I tell you, neither I nor the girl are worth it, and she cared no more for me than she did for Long himself. I suppose I <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303702" n="337     THE COST OF A LIE"/>shall have to go home and ask her to marry me. Heaven knows, I would rather go and hang myself!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303704">' But, Laurie, you told me yourself you would have asked her if——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303705">'Oh, yes; because I knew I couldn't. If I had been a rich man, I should never have looked at her. Dickson, did he suffer very much?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303706">'Not much. He died of sheer exhaustion—as Haines predicted he would; it was not typhoid, but a return of the Peshawur fever brought on by a chill.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303707">'And how did he get a chill?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303708">'Well, he had been up several nights; and on the night that you got a turn he gave in, and instead of going to bed he sat down in the veranda to smoke a pipe, and he went off to sleep—where I found him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303709">'Then, that day I heard them in his room was the funeral?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303710">'Yes. I couldn't tell you, Laurie; it was a matter of life and death with you, and I was obliged to put you off. God forgive me for the awful lies I told you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303711">'I think He will,' said Laurie very quietly; 'but I shall never forgive myself for having murdered him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303712">'Laurie!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303713">'He told me not to go near Hey's, and I went in spite of him, like the wooden-headed fool I am,' Laurie persisted wretchedly. ' And in return for my idiocy, he simply fagged himself to death. As for that woman, she cared as much for me as—as—for the man in the moon. I ask you, Dickson, is it likely any woman would refuse Cardella for <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sake? Is it in reason? No—a thousand times no! I shall have to ask her to marry me; but I am convinced that, in putting Cardella off, she was merely trying to drag somebody with more money on.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303714">It was just a week after this that Dickson went into Laurie's room with a packet of letters and papers in his hand—the English mail was in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303716">' Two for you,' tossing them over to his comrade, and laying aside, with a sigh, two thick passages addressed
<q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303715">The Hon. Eliot Cardella.'</p></q></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303717">'Bills!' said Laurie, throwing his letters down; 'give me a paper whilst you read your letters.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303719">Dickson handed the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> across the table, and Laurie <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303718" n="338     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>opened it at the first column. The paper was, of course, more than three weeks old, being dated three days before that of Eliot Cardella's death. Laurie read through the list of births as carefully as only a man in India can read, telling Dickson twice when a youngster had come for some one they knew. Then an exclamation broke from him, which caused Dickson to look up.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303720">'What is it?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303721">'It is too utterly horrible!' Laurie cried, trembling violently from head to foot. 'He has given his life for the sake of the falsest Jezebel that ever lived! I knew it was all a lie—I knew she was up to some deep crafty game when she lied to him about me. It is no odds to me whom she chose to marry. Heaven knows, I am thankful to get off it; but it has cost him his life. Oh, it is too horrible—too utterly horrible that Cardella has married his brother's murderess!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303722">'<hi rend="italic">What!</hi>' cried Dickson, snatching at the paper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303723">For a moment he could not see the lines; then the mist cleared away from before his eyes, and he was able to read the announcement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303724">'On the 15th, at St. Peter's, Eaton Square, Cecil, Viscount Cardella, to Lilias, only child of the late Major Ross, R.H.A.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303725">'Lilias—yes, they used to call her Lily—a nice kind of "lily"!' put in Laurie scornfully; 'and Eliot has given his life for the sake of the most worthless little jilt that ever lived!' And Dickson, remembering the gossip of the man called Smith, was silent.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303726">So Eliot Cardella passed away into the things that are no more—a martyr to a heartless lie.</p></div></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_209" n="3" type="story"><head>THE HAND OF THE DEAD.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303727">ELIOT CARDELLA had been dead three months, when a draft in charge of two officers arrived to join the regiment at Khotah, the two officers being Captain Page, more commonly spoken of by his brother officers as 'Snipes,' and a Lieutenant, by name William Havers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303729">The Pages had taken off their hands, as it stood, the bungalow which had been occupied by the Russells, who had gone home to take their turn with the depot; so, when they arrived at Khotah, they found themselves comfortably housed without <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303728" n="339     THE HAND OF THE DEAD"/>any trouble or inconvenience. For Havers, however, there were absolutely no quarters; house accommodation in Khotah was limited, and as the Cuirassiers had a large number of married officers, he arrived at his destination not knowing where he would have to lay his head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303730">'I wonder if Dickson would let him have poor Cardella's rooms?' said Gore to Laurie, when Havers was shaking hands all round the mess, and wondering who would take him in. 'He says Snipes has offered him a room till he finds quarters; but he doesn't want to go there, even for a time—he's so beastly slow, you know. Besides, Havers says they're so awfully spoony, it's quite embarrassing to be within half a mile of them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303731">Laurie laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303732">'Fancy Snipes spoony! I remember the day the news came that he'd absolutely married Jakey, and how Eliot and I roared at the idea. Eliot said, in that put-on solemn way of his, "No, I <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> fancy Snipes married." Well, I'll ask Dickson; I don't suppose he'll mind. Only he mayn't like the rooms to be used; it will seem unnatural for anyone but Eliot to be in them. Of course, Havers was in Dickson's house two years at Unapore. Oh, here he is! Dickson, here is poor old Havers turned up, without a hole to put himself in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303733">'Then he'd better come to us,' said Dickson, without hesitation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303734">'You don't mind?' Laurie asked. He knew far better than Gore, or, for the matter of that, anyone else in the regiment, how intensely Dickson had felt the loss of his friend, and how he would shrink from the presence of another in the rooms that had been brightened by Eliot's presence. 'You don't mind?' he repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303735">'No; I'd rather Havers had the rooms than anyone else,' Dickson answered. 'Perhaps you'll tell him. I can't, stop; the Major has just sent for me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303736">Therefore, a couple of hours later, Havers was settled down in the room in which Eliot Cardella had died, thankful to be spared the unpleasantness of living even for a time in the house of his senior, who had married Jakey Kensington-Smith.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303738">Having had an immense and prolonged bath, a luxurious shave, and an entire change of clothing, Havers betook himself into the room, the largest in the bungalow, which was used as a general sitting-room, where he found Gore lying on <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303737" n="340     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>a sofa half asleep, Dickson reading a book, and Laurie just disposing of an iced peg, the sight of which set him longing for one also, notwithstanding that two foaming beakers had been emptied during the prolonged bath, which had made him feel more at peace with himself and his fellow-men than he had done for many days past.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303739">'Shaving's made me thirsty,' he announced, though, as he had not had the exertion of performing that operation for himself, the excuse was not a very good one. 'Here—why, by Jove! you've got old Satan yet! How are you, Satan? Tell Ramsee to bring a sherry and seltzer.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303740">'Yes, sahib,' returned Satan, departing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303741">Havers put his hands in his pockets and lounged across the room to take a closer inspection of what to him was an unwonted sight—a real proper picture in a real proper frame hanging against the wall.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303742">It was a photograph, of imperial size, of Eliot Cardella sitting on a table with his arms folded, one that had been done at Peshawur on the march to Caubool—a striking likeness, with eyes that looked straight out of the picture into yours, and a half-quizzical, wholly pleasant smile under the fair moustaches, as if he had just seated himself carelessly on the table, folded his arms, and said, 'Now then, what are you staring at?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303743">'What a handsome fellow he was!' Havers broke out, after looking at the portrait for fully ten minutes. 'And it wasn't only looks—he was such a splendid chap every way!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303744">Laurie dawdled across the room and stood by Havers, wistfully regarding the pictured face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303745">'Yes,' he said at last, 'thoroughbred from the crown of his head to the soles of his feet, thoroughbred all over;' and then he dawdled back to his lounge under the punkah and relapsed into silence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303746">'I think I never was so cut up,' Havers said presently, when he had found himself a seat, 'as I was when I got your telegram, Dickson. I had only just returned from town, where I had been three days for his brother's wedding. I had dined two nights before at Lord Mallinbro's, and then I had to go up again and break it to them. I can tell you I wished it had been somebody—anyone rather than myself. It was a horrible business, no mistake about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303747">'Did they take it so badly?' Dickson asked.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303748" n="341     THE HAND OF THE DEAD"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303749">'Badly!' the other echoed. 'Yes, very. I can't talk about it, but it was horrible! They hadn't been any too well pleased at Cardella's marriage, but when the smash came——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303750">'The smash! —what smash?' cried Dickson and Laurie in one breath.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303751">'What smash! Why—they're not together, that's all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303752">Not together! what, Lord and Lady Cardella?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303753">Lord and Lady Cardella—they weren't together a week; in fact, it was just four days. I can't tell you why, though I was there and heard the row, and saw all there was to be seen.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303754">'Tell us the whole story, from beginning to end,' said Laurie imperatively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303755">'Oh yes, if you like. You know Cardella was manned on Saturday. Well, on Wednesday I got the telegram, and went up as soon as mid-day stables were over—the telegram reached me about noon. I saw both Lord Mallinbro' and the Countess, and there was a regular scene. Of course, I couldn't tell them anything beyond the bare fact; but Lady Mallinbro' said directly that Eliot had caught his death by attending to Laurie during his illness—Eliot had spoken of it in his last letters. Well, they told me that Cardella was still in the Isle of Wight with his bride, and asked me to telegraph to him to return to town at once, and then to go and meet him and break the news to him. Of course, I couldn't refuse anything they asked of me at such a time, so I went to meet Cardella when he arrived late that night. As soon as he saw me, he called out:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303756">'"Hallo, Havers! you here! <hi rend="italic">You</hi>'ve not come to meet me, have you? Something has gone wrong at home, but what, I don't yet know."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303757">'"Lord Mallinbro' asked me to come and meet you," I told him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303758">'"Really! I hope my mother's not ill?' he said, all in a hurry.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303760">'I really don't know how I got him told, but I did manage to tell him somehow, why he had been sent for, and the awful news I had had from you that morning. I think I never saw a fellow so utterly unmanned in my life. He seemed as if he couldn't believe it. He kept repeating his first words over and over again like a man in a dream, as if they were a foreign language that he couldn't understand, "Eliot— dead." By the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303759" n="342     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>time we reached Eaton Square he had turned so ghastly white that I went into the house with him, though I had intended to leave him at the door, because, you know, one does not like to intrude one's self upon such trouble as they were all in. So I went in with him into the library, where we found Lord and Lady Mallinbro' and the family solicitor, who had come in answer to the note I had written to him for the Earl. Well, he had brought poor Eliot's will—made before he left England—and a letter, written at the same time, addressed to his brother. Cardella took it eagerly and tore it open, we four watching him as he read it. He looked puzzled for a minute—turned back to the beginning and read the first page again, frowning over it as if he couldn't make it out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303761">'"What is it, Cecil?" Lady Mallinbro' asked, going towards him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303762">'He waved her off, holding her at arm's length, while he continued reading with such horror on his white face as I never before saw, and as I hope I never shall see on any human face again. God only knows what there was in the letter, but all at once the Countess called out, "<hi rend="italic">Cecil!</hi>" and Cardella reeled and fell to the floor with a smash, fainted off as dead as any woman in a crowded theatre. Well, of course we picked him up, and after ten minutes or so we brought him round, but he never let go of that letter for an instant. Poor Lady Mallinbro' sat beside him, holding his head on her shoulder; his father stood watching him with a glass of water in his hand, and the lawyer and I looked helplessly on, I, for one, wishing myself very heartily out of the whole business. And there Cardella sat, leaning against his mother, with a face as white as chalk, clutching the letter, and saying over and over again, like a man in a dream, "Oh, my God Almighty! what have I done —what have I done?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303763">'At last Lady Mallinbro' asked him if she might see the letter. He looked piteously up in her face and said;</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303764">'"I have broken your heart, mother; don't hate me if you can help it; you <hi rend="italic">cannot</hi> blame me more than I blame myself. And then he let her take the letter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303765">'Well, she read it over carefully twice, and passed it on to the Earl.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303766">'"I think I will go to my room," she said, taking her arm from round Cardella's neck. "I have had as much as I can bear."</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303767" n="343     THE HAND OF THE DEAD"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303768">'Cardella called out "Mother, mother!" and then she turned back to him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303769">'"I am very sorry for you, Cecil," she said in a crushed, monotonous voice—"I am very sorry for you. What your future life will be I am afraid to think, but you have made her your wife and must abide your choice—only, don't bring her to see me;" and then her voice gave way and she rushed out of the room, crying bitterly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303770">'As for Cardella, he just fainted off again, and the Earl shoved the letter into his pocket, as if it wasn't worth a moment's consideration. He sent off for a doctor, and Cardella was got upstairs and into bed, and then the lawyer and I left the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303771">'I only had a two days' leave, so that I didn't hear exactly how things were, but before I left town Cardella was very ill indeed—brain-fever or something of the kind. Lord Mallinbro' was very nearly heart-broken. I saw him the morning I left, and he told me they were in the greatest anxiety and distress, but that the doctors thought, with care and the aid of a strong constitution, that Cardella would pull through. He didn't tell me what was in the letter, and of course I could not ask him; yet, without doubt, it was something to do with my lady the Viscountess. Any way, three weeks afterwards, I got a note from the Earl thanking me for the little I had been able to do for them, and telling me they were going to take Cardella for a long cruise in the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi>, in the Mediterranean.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303772">'Then it oozed out in Canterbury that they had gone without my lady the Viscountess, and that she had never seen Cardella since the evening that he came up to town in answer to my telegram; and I heard afterwards—just before I came away, in fact—that the lawyer had been sent down to tell her that Lord Mallinbro' would allow her five hundred a year, on condition that she never attempted to see any member of the family again. Heaven only knows what that letter contained, but it must have been something that reflected not too well on my lady's character, or the Mallinbro's never would have taken such strong measures.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303774">'Oddly enough, the <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi> was at Valetta when we called there, and I went on board to see them. Cardella was better in health, but he looked very down in the mouth, poor chap! and small wonder, for I believe he was over head and ears in love with that little jade who swindled him into marrying her. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303773" n="344     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>Well, that's all I know about it. Oh yes—yes—yes, Ramsee, let me have my peg at once.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303775">'Talking's made me thirsty,' he announced, when the iced draught had found its way down the red lane that has no turning. 'Give me another, Ramsee. Phew! how hot it is! One doesn't want half so much to drink at home.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303776">'Oh, you'd want it at home to keep the cold out,' laughed Gore.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303777">Laurie, after one significant look at Dickson, stretched his arms out, sighing the while, clasped his hands at the back of his head, and lay in silence gazing at the punkah waving above him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303778">Dickson went on reading his book, and kept silence also, but after mess that evening, when he was smoking his last pipe before going to roost, Laurie drew a chair up beside him, and said:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303779">'Dickson, have you any idea what was in that letter?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303780">' Yes; it was to explain his reasons for leaving his property to you,' Dickson answered. 'He told me he had left such a letter, and evidently he has told Cardella the whole story without reservation.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303781">There was a long silence, which was at length broken by Laurie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303782">'Dickson,' he said hesitatingly, 'it seems rather a mean thing to say, but I never should have been exactly easy if that woman had—had—'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303783">'Hadn't got her deserts,' Dickson ended for him; 'neither should I.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303784">'Well, you see, her treachery gained so much for her, it was such a brilliant marriage to make, such a splendid position to attain, and after riding rough-shod over Eliot's heart as she did, it would not have been fair if she had gone on flourishing to the end of the chapter, now would it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303786">'For my part,' said Dickson thoughtfully, 'the whole affair only makes me believe more firmly in what I always have believed—the theory of compensation. I don't care whether we do good or evil, we sow for our own harvests, we mar or we work out our own salvation. We carry our lives in our hands, and our lives are what we ourselves make them. It would be simply monstrous if this Ross woman had gone unpunished. She has completely wrecked two lives to satisfy her vanity and her ambition. Eliot laid his down, a cheerful <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303785" n="345     THE HAND OF THE DEAD"/>martyr to the lie of a traitress. Cardella will have his martyrdom to live.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303787">At that very moment Lord Cardella was thinking what Dickson, his brother's friend, had put into words, and wondering how long he could live the life he was then leading without going utterly mad.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303788">The <hi rend="italic">Nymph</hi> was steaming down the Adriatic, and Cardella was on deck, lying in a vast chair under the awning spread as protection from the sun's hot rays. In his hand he held a letter which had reached them that morning—a letter from Dickson, enclosing a photograph of Eliot's grave, and the monument which had been erected by the regiment to his memory. The sight of her son's resting-place had upset Lady Mallinbro' completely, and her husband had gone below with her, leaving Cardella in possession of the picture, and utterly miserable.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303789">Look which way he would, he could see no light, only dark wretchedness. Behind him there lay the long sunny years of his youth, when Eliot had been his best friend. Now Eliot was dead; his grave lay an impassable barrier between him and the woman they had both loved, an insurmountable block to those years, stretching far away into the future, which he had hoped to spend with the wife whom he had married.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303790">How he loved her! Even in her falseness and the treachery for which he had put her away from him, he loved her still. And yet he could never see her again; not even for the woman he loved, the woman he had hoped would be the mother of the Cardellas, could he forgive the sacrifice of that brave life which had been given up in the very flower of its youth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303791">Nor was that all that he had against her—she had been the means of turning his heart against the brother he had always loved. She had begged him to keep their engagement a secret until within a month of the day fixed for the marriage, saying that Eliot had a prejudice against her, an intense dislike and distrust of her, and she was convinced, if he knew his brother was going to marry her, he would try to make mischief between them—he would endeavour to part them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303793">Cardella, looking back from his present experience, knew very well
that she had been afraid Eliot might tell him that 
<pb n="346     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS" pages="346" facs="jwcavalp346"/>
she had acknowledged herself in love with Laurie—he thought scornfully how little she had known his dead brother's character; and then, with a pang of bitter remorse, he remembered that he, who had known Eliot with the close intimacy of strong and mutual affection from his boyhood, had been so infatuated as to believe her. For her sake, at her bidding, he had acted as if Eliot was capable—Eliot, the soul of honour—for a prejudice, a dislike, of trying to make mischief between his brother and his promised wife.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303794">Yes. He had believed it, and he told himself he was justly punished. Why, he held in his hand the testimony of a whole regiment to the worth of the brave heart he had doubted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303795">For this was the inscription written upon Eliot Cardella's grave:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303796">'ERECTED
<lb/>BY THE OFFICERS, NON-COMMISSIONED OFFICERS,
<lb/>AND MEN OF THE
<lb/>ROYAL REGIMENT OF CUIRASSIERS,
<lb/>TO THE MEMORY OF THEIR COMRADE, THE
<lb/>HON. ELIOT CARDELLA,
<lb/>Captain,
<lb/>YOUNGER SON OF THE EARL OF MALLINBRO',
<lb/>WHO DIED OF FEVER, FEB. 25, 18—,
<lb/>UNIVERSALLY REGRETTED.
<lb/><hi rend="italic">"He gave his life for the sake of his friend."'</hi></p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303797">Dickson's letter told how, when it became known that the officers had agreed to raise a monument to his memory, the non-commissioned officers and men had begged to be allowed to join them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303798">'A small proof,' Dickson ended, 'of the universal love and esteem in which your son was held."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303799">And he had doubted him! During three months he had not written to him, leaving unanswered several letters which ended, ' Why don't you write to me? What are you after?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303800">There were two letters in his desk now which he would give half his life to answer as affectionately as they were written; but, alas! it often happens, as Dickson quoted to poor Eliot months before:</p><q><l>'He that will not when he may,</l><l>When he will he shall have nay.'</l></q><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303801" n="347     THE HAND OF THE DEAD"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303802">It was so with Viscount Cardella. When he would fain have replied to those letters it was too late—the fingers which had penned them had been cold and stiff ere ever they had reached him—the frank eyes of the writer were closed—the brave heart stilled—the faithful spirit had passed away, in all unconsciousness that the traitress, whose vanity and ambition had cost him his life, had even turned the heart of his only brother against him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303803">Looking back to the time of his first meeting with Lilias Ross, Cardella wondered that he had not seen at once how things were. He remembered it all so well now—how Eliot had persuaded her to sing; the song was ringing in his cars at that moment:
<q><l>' If only the dead could find out when</l><l>To come back and be forgiven.'</l></q>
Lord Cardella groaned as the memory of that day came back to him—
<q><l>'——come back and be forgiven.'</l></q>
What! for the offences they had never committed? Ah, if only Eliot could come back from his far-off Indian grave—not to be forgiven, but to forgive!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303804">Useless wish! The seed that is sown must come to harvest; sorrows wrought in the irrevocable past can never be undone. As Dickson said that very hour, 'We sow for our own harvests; we mar or we work out our own salvation. We carry our lives in our hands, and our lives are what we ourselves make them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303805">They had both wronged him—the man and the woman he had loved; and, utterly without intent on his part, their punishment had come to them by his hand—the hand of the dead.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_210" n="4" type="story"><head>WAFTED FROM PARADISE.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303806">THE Cuirassiers had been giving a dance, and the manner in which it had gone off was under discussion in the smoking-room of Dickson's bungalow; they generally called the large room where the four officers sat by that name, though, as may be imagined, tobacco was not confined to those four tall whitewashed walls.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303807" n="348     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303808">'I think it went off wonderfully well, considering everything,' said Laurie; 'and oh, I say, wasn't Jakey a swell! Did you see the lace on her dress? It must have cost a fortune—Snipes made her hold the tail out of harm's way all the time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303809">'And he wouldn't let anyone else dance with her,' added Havers. 'As if anyone wanted—scraggy little thing! I hate scraggy women.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303810">'I saw the Colonel dancing with her,' put in Dickson—'a square, that is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303811">'Oh yes, she graciously gave me a square,' cried Havers. 'At which I was just about as charmed as the Colonel looked. I say, what a terrible let-down that arm is!—if it had been the right instead of the left, he'd have to leave.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303812">'Couldn't have held a sword. All the same, he's got a long head of his own. But he's only going to stay till his five years are up, and then he's going to leave the service; he says he feels he's no good now. Such humbug! A head like his is worth five hundred Snipeses, who do nothing but eat and draw their pay. Oh, what an ass Snipes is! Dickson, did you see him spooning Jakey in the garden to-night?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303813">Dickson made a face, more expressive than words, and Laurie rattled on:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303814">'She came the excessively tender on me; recalled all the happy days we spent together—<hi rend="italic">together</hi>, if you please—at Canterbury. Said she hoped we should always be friends— <hi rend="italic">good</hi> friends. It strikes <hi rend="italic">me</hi> she finds Snipes and his spiritualism, and his spooniness combined, rather a bore.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303815">'And he's so awfully spoony,' Dickson put in disdainfully. 'Enough to make any woman think a man a bore. He never reads a book; never looks at a paper; never writes a letter; never plays polo, football, cricket, billiards; never dreams of playing tennis—afraid to ask any fellows there, I suppose, lest they should get talking to his wife; in fact, the fellow seems to take absolutely no interest in anything but his spiritualistic humbug and spooning that wretched little woman. Gad! though, what an opinion the man must have of himself to intrude his company so persistently on her as he does!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303816">'Oh, well, Jakey did all the love-making beforehand,' said Havers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303817">'Yes, I'm sure of that,' added Laurie. 'Jakey would go in for spiritualism, hot and strong, depend upon it.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303818" n="349     WAFTED FROM PARADISE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303819">'She did,' Havers affirmed. 'She's every bit as bad as Snipes. I assure you we hadn't got through the Straits before she found out I was one of the most powerful mediums she'd ever come in contact with. Now, I may be a medium, but I didn't quite see being mesmerized by Jakey.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303820">'By Jove, no!' Laurie exclaimed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303821">'I never told you about our little séance on board, did I?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303822">'No; had you one?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303823">'Oh, we had several, but only one with any great results,' Havers answered. 'You see, everybody pretty nearly believed in it, or said they did, just for the fun of the thing; but there was one small old chap, the Chief Commissioner at Oolhi—the most inveterate old snuff-taker I ever came across—who wasn't to be converted any way: a regular Philistine, and as good as told Snipes to his face he was an ass, who ought to be dropped overboard. Jakey tried all her fascinations on the old chap, but it wasn't any good; the old heathen wouldn't believe in anything.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303824">'Perhaps he didn't particularly admire Jakey,' suggested Laurie, who didn't admire her at all himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303825">'That was just it. I said to him one evening when he'd been extra short to her: "You don't seem to admire Mrs. Page, Mr. D'Arcy." "Well," he said, taking a great pinch of snuff, "I can't say I do particularly admire scaffold-poles myself."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303826">'"Scaffold-poles!"' screamed Laurie. 'Why, bless the old boy, what a splendid description! If I had racked my brains for a year, I should never have hit Jakey off so beautifully. Well, then, what about the séance?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303828">'Oh, the séance! Well, we had ever so many, and nothing transpired but a few knocks, half of which I made with my toe under the table. I don't believe in it a bit, you know, but I joined in it just for the fun, as everyone else did, excepting old D'Arcy, who used to sit by gibing and jeering, and making half of us choke ourselves with laughter. Well, at last we were regularly set going—the lamps were turned down so that we could only just distinguish the outlines of the figures round the table, and there we sat, with our hands touching, as solemn and as silent as the grave. Presently the table began to turn, and then to knock. I hadn't anything to do with that, but I rather fancy somebody else had. For my part, I was too much occupied by a pretty little Philistine going out to join her parents at Bombay to trouble myself to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303827" n="350     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>knock—a very charming, bright little girl she was, full of fun and mischief. Poor little soul! she died of cholera within three days of landing. I little thought that night, as we steamed across the Indian Ocean, I should be standing by her grave within a fortnight. Well, that's the sort of incident one meets with in this beastly country; still, I was sorry, poor little soul! Well, we agreed with the spirits that two knocks should stand for "No," and three for "Yes"; and that if we spelt out the alphabet, they should knock at the letters they wanted, thus: " A, B," knock B. Then from the beginning again. "A, B, C, D, E "—knock twice. "Bee"—don't you see? And then we began in right-down good earnest. We had several spirits, neither amusing nor instructive; then a spirit more startling than the rest rapped out that his name was Henry Smith, and that he had come straight from paradise. At this, a goose of a girl on the other side of the table shrieked out that she was afraid; and, indeed, I fancy most of us were quaking more or less. I know my heart was going like a steam-engine, and little Miss Crescy clutched hold of my hand and held it tight. Still, we kept our hands in the circle; none of us were so frightened but that we wanted to hear a little more. We asked all sorts of questions—Jakey first and foremost, of course.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303829">'"Good spirit," said she, "are there any flowers in paradise?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303830">'Three emphatic knocks on the table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303831">'"Does the sun shine there, good spirit?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303832">'Three more knocks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303833">'"Dear me," struck in old D'Arcy, who hadn't said a word for full twenty minutes, "I always understood it did nothing of the kind."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303834">'A few of the Philistines sniggered at the remark, but the faithful did not condescend to notice such levity.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303835">'"Will you tell us, kind spirit," Jakey went on, as if she was reciting poetry at a penny reading, "if the blessed souls in paradise are <hi rend="italic">per</hi>-fectly happy?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303836">'Three loud knocks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303837">'"Then, why did you come here?" I asked, at which old D'Arcy called out:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303838">'"Well done, my lad—that's a clincher!"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303839">'But it wasn't. The spirit of Henry Smith was nonplussed, but Jakey was more than equal to the occasion.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303840" n="351     WAFTED FROM PARADISE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303841">'"Did you wish to come?" I persisted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303842">'Two knocks for "No."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303843">'"Do not insult the good spirit, Mr. Havers." said Jakey, with reproachful dignity, whereupon the spirit, or somebody, set up a loud and prolonged rapping, which shook the table visibly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303844">'At this point a Roman Catholic lady asked if he could tell her whether her Aunt Mary had got out of purgatory yet?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303845">'Two knocks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303846">' "Does that mean that she has not got out of purgatory?"
 I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303847">'Three knocks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303848">'The Roman Catholic lady sighed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303849">'"Poor Aunt Mary!" Then, as if a thought had suddenly occurred to her, she asked: "Did you ever meet a Mrs. Watson there?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303850">'"Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303851">'"Is she happy?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303852">'"Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303853">'"A little woman with 'cross-eyes'?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303854">'" Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303855">'"Oh dear! Do people take cross-eyes to paradise with them?" somebody exclaimed in crestfallen tones.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303856">'"To be sure; how would their friends know them else?" someone else replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303857">'"How long have you been in paradise?" I asked. "Shall we count years?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303858">'"Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303859">'So we counted up to fifty-three, and then he rapped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303860">'"Fifty-three years?" I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303861">'"Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303862">'"Then, why did you come here?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303863">'The spirit maintained a dignified silence; but I wasn't going to let him off in that way.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303864">'"Did you feel drawn to us?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303865">'"Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303866">'"You perhaps thought we seemed unhappy down here, and that you would come and tell us what a beautiful place paradise is?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303868">'" Yes." (Three quick, cheerful knocks.) "That was very kind of you; we are extremely obliged to you," I said civilly, for really I began to think Henry Smith was a spirit more <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303867" n="352     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>obliging than the average. "Now, as there are some unbelievers here"—I didn't think it necessary to say I was one of 'em—"could you not leave us some token of your presence? 'We have heard of such things—a tress of hair—a brilliant light—a flower—so that we may be absolutely certain that you really are a spirit from paradise?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303869">'"No."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303870">'"You cannot do that?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303871">'"No."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303872">'"But you would if you could?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303873">'Three loud thumps in reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303874">'"But could you not," Jakey suggested eagerly—"could you not, good spirit, waft us a perfume—some peculiar scent unknown on earth—that, smelling once here, we should never be able to forget, but could recognise the instant we reach the everlasting fields of light?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303875">'The spirit said, "<hi rend="italic">Yes!</hi>"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303876">'Now, here I must tell you emphatically once more that I believed the whole thing to be humbug. Poor little Miss Crescy was rather frightened, for she clutched my hand tight, and she never once opened her mouth, and I must say, poor little woman! she was not given to either proceeding. As for Jakey, she went on questioning Henry Smith in as awestruck tones as if she had been in the presence of a real ghost with his head under his arm.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303877">'"Then, dear spirit," she continued solemnly, "you will waft us this perfume?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303878">'"Yes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303879">'At this point I burst into a fit of smothered laughter; all the others cried "Hush—sh—sh!" just as if we had been in church. Not that it had the smallest effect upon me, for I simply roared.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303880">'<hi rend="italic">I had heard the. perfume coming</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303881">'They all said there was nothing to laugh at, and a moment later <hi rend="italic">it came</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303882">'"Ah! Ehm—a—ah! Hey—ey—ah!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303883">'Everyone sniffed up the air with a different expression, and the girl who had been frightened at first fainted clean away, as she sat with her hands clasped in her neighbours'.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303885">'Not that anyone took any notice—not the very least. Bless you! such trivial matters as swoons were as nothing compared with a perfume wafted all the way from paradise. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303884" n="353     WAFTED FROM PARADISE"/>The girl might have died, poor little fool! for all the help any of them would have given her at that critical moment. They went on sniffing; they said it was unique—wonderful—perfect—fearful—awful—

In fact, the most wonderful part of it all to me was the language they all used. I don't know that I ever heard so much tall talk in one half-hour before; such fine, high-faluting expressions they all used; their friends at home would hardly have known them, for they seemed one and all to have forgotten their everyday English and taken to poetry-phrases and blank verse.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303889">'As usual, Jakey outshone everybody.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303890">'"I think," she cried enthusiastically—" I think that were I gasping out my last breath, and at the point of death, the subtle power of that perfect perfume would revive me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303891">'"I shouldn't at all wonder," I remarked dryly, taking my hands off the table and turning up the lamp.

I shouldn't at all wonder if he don't end by petrifying altogether, like that chap Mark Twain mentions in one of his books.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303904">'Nor I,' Stewart rejoined, with a laugh. 'I say, now, can you, any of you, fancy the Sphinx was ever a boy who stole apples and smoked on the sly? I can't.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303905">'Smokes hard enough now,' put in Greville. 'He always stinks like a tap-room on a market-day. I wonder that pretty little woman can stand it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303906">'And she is a pretty little woman; no mistake about that,' Douglas asserted. 'And as to Hope's ever having been a boy, I can vouch for that—a jollier chap didn't live.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303907">'By Jove, you don't say so!' the others exclaimed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303908">As for Marchmont, he just finished off his letter and went to join the group at the fire.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303910">' I've known Hope all my life,' Douglas went on. 'We were at school together as little lads of that height'—holding his hand some four feet from the ground; 'and then we went to Eton, and then to Sandhurst, and then we tried our little best to get into the same regiment. However, that we couldn't manage, for he was gazetted to the Drab Horse, I to the Red Lancers. Of course, I lost sight of him entirely <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303909" n="355     PALLAS ATHENE"/>during the five years I was in India—that is, I never heard from him, though I knew he had exchanged into this regiment. I think I was more delighted at getting into the same regiment with him than I was at getting the Majority; and I don't know that I was ever so disappointed as I was when I found what an awful change had come over him, and the difference a few years had made in him. Ten years ago, he was one of the liveliest, most cheery, go-ahead dare-devils in existence. Now—why, upon my soul! he's more like a Low-Church parson with a bad digestion and something on his conscience, than anything I can think of. I call it simply pitiable to see a good man gone wrong in that way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303911">'I wonder what the deuce Miss Hawthorndean sees in him,' said Greville thoughtfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303912">Greville had more than once been suspected of an eye to Miss Hawthorndean himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303913">'Lord knows,' returned Curtis, shaking his head. 'Women are queer compounds; you never know what will or won't please 'em—particularly in a man.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303914">'No, faith; or what will or won't please a man in a woman,' cried Douglas with a laugh, as he rose. 'I wonder if there's some woman at the bottom of the change in Hope?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303915">'Never heard a breath of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303916">'What's that photograph he has in his room?' Curtis asked. 'I've often wondered; but Hope isn't the sort of chap one can ask questions of.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303917">'Oh, it's a fancy sketch; he told me so,' Greville replied. ' "Pallas Athene," I believe he calls it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303918">'Well, I must go; there's no rest for some poor devils,' groaned Curtis, settling his forage-cap on his head and clattering out with his sword trailing after him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303919">'Poor old Curtis! when he's on duty he leaves a regular stream of curses and maledictions behind him,' said Douglas, with a good-natured laugh. 'What are you going to do, Greville?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303920">'I thought of going down to call on the Westmacotts; they've been married three months, and I have never been yet'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303921">'Neither have I. I think I'll go with you and get it done With,' rejoined Douglas.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303923">So the two went out together, and Marchmont turned back to the desk to write another letter, which was—well, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303922" n="356     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>not exactly concerning a dinner-party. He had scribbled as far as the third page, when Hope, who had been the subject of conversation, entered the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303924">'Oh, you're here, Marchmont!' he said, in a tone which implied that he had been seeking him. 'Are you busy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303925">'Shall be done directly. Do you want anything?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303926">'Yes, I do, rather; but'—looking round—' we can't talk in comfort here. Some of the fellows are sure to come in bothering. Come up to my room, will you, when you've done that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303927">'All right,' Marchmont answered. So, when he had finished his letter, he went up to Hope's room, to hear what it was that he wanted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303928">Hope was sitting by the window smoking, and Marchmont, having just been listening to the conversation about him, looked at him with perhaps more searching interest than he had ever done before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303929">'Yes, that man has a story,' the younger soldier said to himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303930">Lord Hope might be five-and-thirty—a very well-built, active man about five feet ten in height, with cleanly-cut limbs, neat, smart feet, neither too large nor too small; with very black and smooth hair, an olive-coloured skin, which, had the eyes been very dark also, might have given him a foreign air. But the eyes were not dark, and he was essentially an Englishman in appearance; indeed, the eyes were gray, nor were they even of a dark shade, though the eyelashes were very black. They were fine eyes, and they had a way of looking from under their long lashes with a speculative glance that seemed to go up and down and through whatever their owner looked at.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303931">'Yes, he has a story,' repeated Marchmont to himself, with much decision.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303932">'Have a chair,' said Hope, pointing to one with his toe. 'You see, Marchmont, these sports are coming off next week.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303933">'Yes,' said Marchmont.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303934">'And Miss Hawthorndean wants to see them,' Hope continued.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303935">'Yes,' said Marchmont again, not being particularly surprised at the communication.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303937">'I don't suppose Sir Thomas will come; but of course Lady Hawthorndean will, and there'll be several visitors of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303936" n="357     PALLAS ATHENE"/>their. Well, you see, I must give them some lunch, and as your room is next to mine——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303938">'Oh yes, to be sure!' Marchmont broke in. 'You're quite welcome to it, of course. I'll tell Mrs. Thingum-te-catch to make it presentable.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303939">'Thanks awfully; it's very kind of you,' said Hope, with his preoccupied, absent air. 'You see, the rooms here are wretchedly small; and, since you'll lend me yours, we'll lunch there, and come in here to see the sports. I'm sure I don't know why she wants to see them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303940">'Oh, ladies always like such things!' Marchmont answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303941">Then they fell to talking of other things, and somehow the attention of the younger man was drawn to the photograph Douglas and the other fellows had been talking about. Being young, and tolerably endowed with assurance, he made no more ado of getting up and examining it than he would have done of looking at the <hi rend="italic">Punch</hi>on the anteroom table.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303942">It was hung rather high above the chimney-shelf; but Marchmont, who was one of the biggest men in the regiment, found it just on a level with his eyes, and so stood with his hands in his pockets and examined it at his leisure.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303943">'Your sister, Hope?' he said, after a bit, taking his pipe out of his mouth to ask the question.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303944">'No; I never had a sister,' Hope answered curtly. But, at the same time, though the words were as few as possible, yet the tone was not forbidding, and was accompanied by a half-sigh that seemed to come up from the lowest depths of his heart, though it was, as it were, bitten off sharp ere it left his lips.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303945">As for Marchmont, he just stood still staring at the photograph, which was certainly the most remarkable one he had ever seen. It represented a young and fair-haired woman dressed in white, an evening dress, apparently, of tulle or net, for the top of the low bodice and the short sleeves were all of soft puffings; the neck and arms were bare—such a neck! such arms!—fair and round, as if they had been cut out of marble, and decked with neither necklace nor armlets. Nor were there any rings on the firm, well-cut long hands. Of a truth, the original of the picture had been wise when she carried into effect the old adage, 'When unadorned, adorned the most'.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303946" n="358     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303947">But, though the large gracious figure was superb, its beauty was as nothing to the statuesque perfection of the face. The head was turned slightly aside, so that the dark, mournful eyes looked out of the picture into space—great gray eyes that looked almost black, and contrasted strikingly with the beautiful dead-gold hair and the transparent pallor of the complexion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303948">Perhaps the ideal head of <hi rend="italic">La République</hi>gives the best idea of her, or the words which, on a closer inspection, Marchmont saw were written in pencil beneath the figure and above the name, which told that the picture had been made in Rome.</p><q><lg><l>'Pallas Athene, with her deep gray eyes,</l><l>In modern garb and with her glorious hair</l><l>Bound in a knot behind her shapely head,</l><l>And her rich form, majestic, calm.</l><l>Or the young Empress Queen standing before</l><l>Her wild Hungarians, when they cried:</l><l>"Pro rege nostro moriamur."'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303949">'She's very handsome,' observed Marchmont, by way of getting at her history, if he could.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303950">Lord Hope rose and went beside his comrade, where he stood looking at the picture in silence—a silence which lasted some minutes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303951">'I don't know that she was very handsome,' he said at last; 'but she was a grand woman.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303952">'<hi rend="italic">Was?</hi>' echoed Marchmont. 'Why, is she dead?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303953">'Not that I know of,' Hope answered, sinking back in his chair, and filling his meerschaum again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303954">'Oh, then, she was somebody you——' But there Marchmont broke off short—not even his native impudence could go quite so far as to ask such an impertinent question as that.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303955">But Hope did not seem to notice it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303956">'Someone I was in love with,' he ended for him. 'Yes, I was—more hopelessly, miserably, desperately in love than any man ever was with any woman on earth.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303957">'Poor chap!' murmured Marchmont pityingly, altogether forgetting the ten years' difference in their ages and the difference of their rank—army rank, that is, of course. 'But it's not possible she refused you, Hope?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303958">Hope's gray eyes turned upon the younger man.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303960">'I was engaged to her,' he said briefly, 'and I lost her— <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303959" n="359     PALLAS ATHENE"/>through my own fault. So I have had to take the consequences, and I'm going to marry Miss Hawthorndean next month. There, Marchmont, that's the whole story—nothing very wonderful about it, is there?'—smiling at the other's long face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303961">'But the lines?' Marchmont began, his curiosity raised to the highest pitch.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303962">Hope laughed outright.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303963">'Mere nonsense—all out of measure, and the blankest of blank verse, though they suited her well enough at the time they were written.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303964">'But it seems such a pity,' said the younger man eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303965">'Oh, everything that comes of temper is a pity,' Hope replied. 'That charming little lady you introduced me to in town the other day may be thankful you have a good temper; I was always cursed with a bad one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303966">That was all Marchmont could get out of him. The momentary desire for someone to confide in, the craving for human sympathy which for an instant had assailed him, had passed away, and Hope was himself again—cold, grave, a little caustic, and utterly self-contained.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303967">As I have said, Marchmont was well, very well, endowed with assurance, and he had also a tongue which blurted out almost everything that came into his head. On this occasion neither his assurance nor his tongue failed him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303968">'It's a poor look-out for Miss Hawthorndean,' he said bluntly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303969">'Just what I tell her,' returned Hope; 'but she won't be convinced. Oh, women are queer compounds!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303970">Marchmont positively jumped at the words—just what he had heard Curtis say half an hour before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303971">'Well, I have to go to a tennis-party,' he said abruptly. 'It will be all right about the room, Hope.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303972">'Thank you very much,' Hope returned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303973">He sat where Marchmont had left him for ever so long; his thoughts strayed away into that past where his happiness and his love lay dead, never to rise for him any more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303974">'It was all my fault—all,' he groaned—'all my cursed temper! I couldn't expect her to overlook it; no proud woman would. And Nell was very proud—very, though I thought she loved me better than that. Yes; I thought she loved me better than that.'</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303975" n="360     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_213" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303976">THE day fixed for the athletic sports of the 30th Dragoons had come—a glorious July morning, with a brisk, fresh breeze, which tempered the heat of the brilliant sun.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303977">Liliminster Barracks were all in a flutter of expectancy and preparation; courses were being marked out; clowns were getting up themselves and their jokes alike—like the average of military clowns, accomplishing the first very well and the second very indifferently. Men who were going in for the full marching-order competition were polishing helmets and buttons, pipe-claying facings and gloves, and carefully brushing uniforms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303978">It happened that Marchmont, who was orderly-officer for the day, had completed his round of the dinners and had been to the hospital, when Miss Hawthorndean, driving her father in a smart little cart, turned in at the gates and sent her pony spinning along to the officers' quarters, just as Marchmont reached the front-door thereof.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303979">'Good-morning,' he said, with a salute. 'Good-morning, Sir Thomas. Shall I show you the way to Lord Hope's rooms?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303980">'Yes, do, please,' Miss Hawthorndean answered. ' Sir Thomas and I are before our time—half an hour, are we not? We drove over early to let Lord Hope know what a heap of people are coming—there are no fewer than seven, not counting Sir Thomas and myself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303981">'Oh, he will be able to accommodate them,' Marchmont answered easily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303982">'Do you think so? He said they were such very little rooms. You have lent him yours, haven't you, Mr. Marchmont?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303983">'Yes; I have.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303984">'Then, we shall be guests to both of you, shall we not? There are mamma and Gwen—you've met my sister, have you not?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303985">'Yes; I have had the pleasure,' Marchmont replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303986">'Yes; I thought so, though I remember she was always away when you have dined with us. Well, then there are the spoons, who will make four.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303987">'The spoons!' repeated Marchmont, pausing half-way up the stairs and looking at her with perplexed eyes.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303988" n="361     PALLAS ATHENE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303989">'Yes-the most ro-<hi rend="italic">man</hi>tic story you ever heard;' said Miss Hawthorndean impressively. ' They came last night, <hi rend="italic">quite</hi>unexpectedly. I only knew they were coming two hours before, and they're engaged, you know. It's most ro-<hi rend="italic">man</hi>tic. <hi rend="italic">She</hi> is a great friend of mine, but I haven't seen her for ages; for she has been two years—no, three, I think—in New Zealand for her lungs, or her chest, or something, and <hi rend="italic">he</hi> has been in India five or six years—all through the Afghan campaign and <hi rend="italic">cov</hi>-ered with glory and medals. His name is Dickson—Major Dickson of the Cuirassiers; at least, of the White Dragoons now. Well, he has been in love with her, goodness only knows besides himself how many years; but unfortunately, poor darling! she was engaged to somebody else, who behaved <hi rend="italic">abominably</hi>to her. I forget his name, if indeed I ever heard, for she never talks about it if she can help it. Well, this pair actually met in a hotel at Bombay, where she and her mother were staying a few weeks on their May home from New Zealand; and actually they made it up there and then, and they're going to be married directly. I didn't know anything about it till she telegraphed that they were coming, though, of course, I knew she had returned to England, and she had promised to pay me a visit before I leave home. She's such a darling!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303990">'And they're very spoony?' said Marchmont, laughing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303991">'Oh, well, Major Dickson is very spoony—horribly so; but
Miss Vansittart—oh, well—she's—not—er—' She broke off short there, and Marchmont laughed again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303992">Then, as they walked down the corridor, Lord Hope, who had heard their voices, came out of his room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303993">'You are come, then,' he said, taking his <hi rend="italic">fiancée's</hi> hand.
'Welcome to bachelor quarters.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303994">'Very comfortable-looking quarters too,' Miss Hawthorndean remarked, standing in the middle of the room and spinning slowly round. 'Are they not, papa? And what flowers! I did not know you were so fond of flowers, Cecil.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303995">'I got them in your honour,' answered Hope, smiling at her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303996">'How nice of you!' crossing the room towards the fireplace. 'What a smart chimney-shelf! And——<hi rend="italic">Who</hi> is that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303998">Sir Thomas, who had been in the army himself, and was keenly interested in all that concerned it, was already buried in a military journal which he had found lying on the side <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1303997" n="362     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>table. Marchmont, who was standing behind him, and therefore behind Miss Hawthorndean also, saw a sudden frown pass over Hope's dark brows.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1303999">'No one you ever knew, Dorothy, but a lady I knew a long time ago,' he answered lamely, and thinking, just as Marchmont thought, what a fool he had been not to take the picture down.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304000">'Were you—ever—engaged to her?' Miss Hawthorndean asked, in so low a voice that, though Marchmont guessed her meaning, he did not catch the words.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304001">'What an absurd idea!' exclaimed Hope, in a vain attempt to hide the truth. 'Whatever put that into your head, Dorothy?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304002">'Nothing at all,' said Dorothy Hawthorndean, and turned away from the picture, as if the sight of it had sickened her. 'I will sit here'—seating herself on a sofa (a bed, really) which stood between the two little windows. 'Show me your photograph-book, Cecil.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304003">'The carriage has just turned in at the gate,' Hope answered. 'Must I not go down and meet your mother?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304004">'Mr. Marchmont will go; stay here,<hi rend="italic">please</hi>,' Miss Hawthorndean urged, in a voice so pleading that Lord Hope obeyed her, and brought the book without a word.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304005">As soon as Marchmont had left the room, she cast one hurried glance at Sir Thomas, and, seeing that he was still engrossed by the journal, turned to her lover and laid her hand on his.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304006">'Cecil,' she said, in a trembling voice, 'something is going to happen.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304007">'My dear child, what <hi rend="italic">can</hi> happen?' he asked soothingly, wondering why she had grown so nervous all at once.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304008">'But I tell you something is,' she persisted. 'I want to tell you to let nothing surprise you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304009">But Hope turned and looked at her in such unmitigated surprise that the girl's dark eyes filled with tears; and she turned her head aside, just as her mother and Marchmont entered the room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304010">'We have brought you such a host of visitors, Cecil,' she said, smiling. 'Some you have seen, and some you have not. Oh, here are Miss Ogilvie and Lady Grace.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304011">'Welcome to bachelor quarters!' said Hope, wondering the while what on earth was the matter with Dorothy.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304012" n="363     PALLAS ATHENE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304013">Lady Hawthorndean looked back through the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304014">'Ah! Major Dickson, Cecil, Major Dickson of the White Dragoons—that's the regular form of military introduction, is it not?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304015">'I don't know,' said Hope, smiling. 'Very glad to see you; how do you do?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304016">' How do you do?' repeated Dickson, with equal friendliness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304017">'Gwen, and Miss Vansittart,' said Lady Hawthorndean smilingly to Lord Hope.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304018">Dorothy, watching him closely, saw that at the sight of her friend the olive hue of his face faded to a sickly white which spread even to his very lips; then, by an immense effort, he went a step forward, and held out his hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304019">But Nell Vansittart's composure was not so great: ere she could touch the outstretched fingers, she reeled and fell headlong to the ground in a faint.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304020">Of course, there was then a tremendous commotion. Lady Hawthorndean and Dickson lifted her up and got her on to a chair, while Hope stood looking helplessly on, the very picture of dismay. It was Marchmont who fetched water and champagne-cup out of the adjoining room—though, if he had known it, brandy would have answered the purpose better—it was Marchmont who thought of administering a bumper of cup to little Miss Hawthorndean, who still sat on the sofa-bed, holding on bravely for dear life, lest she too should faint off, and so make confusion utterly confounded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304021">'What made you faint like that, my dear?' Lady Hawthorn-dean asked, in her kind way. 'Is this room too warm? I did not notice it myself. Cecil, I think you have too many flowers for this small space.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304022">Just at that moment, Dickson, bending over Miss Vansittart, said in a low voice, ' You are better now, my darling?' and the words brought Lord Hope all at once to his senses.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304024">'I got the flowers for Dorothy,' he replied to Lady Hawthorndean's remark. 'Dorothy, will you mind if your decorations are removed for the present? Why '—sitting down on the cot and taking the tumbler, still half full of cup, from Marchmont, who was standing anxiously regarding her—' why, how this has upset you! Drink a little more of this, my darling. How odd! You said something was going to happen, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304023" n="364     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>and I laughed at you. I won't laugh at your prophecies any more. I think you have the gift of second-sight, my child.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304025">'Second-sight,' echoed Dorothy, with a shivering. 'Yes, Cecil, I think I have the gift of second-sight.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304026">Hope lifted his black brows inquiringly, as if she was speaking in riddles, quite beyond his power to solve, as if he was entirely at a loss to understand her; but Marchmont, who had taken in the whole situation in an instant, saw that he winced as if he had received a blow. He rose abruptly from the cot, and went across the room to Lady Hawthorndean's side.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304027">'Is Miss Vansittart sufficiently recovered to go in to lunch?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304028">'Oh yes—yes; I am quite well now,' Miss Vansittart answered, avoiding his eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304029">'Then, may I give you my arm?' Lord Hope said, addressing Lady Hawthorndean.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304030">The party was a failure—a complete failure. Miss Vansittart scarcely spoke a word during the whole lunch, and seemed so upset and unwell that her hostess suggested that Major Dickson should drive her home in Dorothy's cart, at which proposal she caught eagerly; and, as may be imagined, Dickson needed no second hint to urge him to turn his back on Liliminster Bariacks and the sports of the 30th Dragoons.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304031">And Dorothy Hawthorndean, who was out-and-out thoroughbred from the top of her dark curly head to the soles of her wee little feet, went in to lunch with Marchmont, and plucked up her spirits and behaved like a brave little gentlewoman, as she was, laughing in her own gay, light-hearted way, talking in her odd, breathless, emphatic fashion, appealing every now and then, 'Cecil, now <hi rend="italic">don't</hi> you think so and so?' just as Hope had always known her to do; so that Hope himself was mightily relieved, and flattered himself she had not connected the portrait of Pallas Athene in any way with the headlong manner in which Nell Vansittart had expressed her surprise at meeting with him again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304033">But in spite of Miss Hawthorndean's pluck, and the sympathetic way in which Marchmont backed up her efforts, as he himself said, by talking until his jaws ached, the whole affair was wofully flat. Even after 'the spoons' had gone, nobody seemed able to get up any interest in the sports. Not that <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304032" n="365     PALLAS ATHENE"/>they were below the average of military athletic sports. There were flat races and hurdle races, sergeants' races and officers' races, tugs-of-war both of men and boys, races of men tied up in sacks and men with legs together, spring-jumping and running high-jumps; in short, there were the usual items which go to make up the whole of a regimental display of athletic sports. But to the majority—at least, to the most important actors in this story—the whole concern was flat, stale, and unprofitable. Dorothy laughed loudly at the clowns, whose idea of extreme funniness seemed to be to call every person of the gentle sex who came within speaking-distance by the time-honoured title of 'mother'; yet the girl was growing tired of making-believe to be gay, and the laughter towards the end of the entertainment grew very unmirthful indeed. Lord Hope certainly did his very best; he sat at the same window with Dorothy, his arms on the sill, and a box filled with shillings on the ledge before him, pointing out to her which men were in his troop, which were first-rate soldiers, and which were black sheep, explaining everything there was to explain, and breaking off every now and then to shout:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304034">'Hallo, Jackson! you won a first prize? Well, you must have an extra shilling for that;' or, 'Why, Short, you beaten? Did that knee let you down? Well, you must have a couple of shillings for that.—I always give a few pounds away on occasions like these,' he said to Dorothy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304035">'How pleased he looked!' she said, when one flushed dragoon in jersey and drawers had gone limping away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304036">'Yes—poor chap! I was walking back to barracks behind him one day in the winter, and he came down on a piece of orange-peel—a regular smash. I had to call a cab to get him home. It lets him down every now and then, as it did just now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304037">He did not add, as he might have done, that he had helped the man into that same cab and taken him up to the hospital himself; but Dorothy Hawthorndean could see for herself that the Sphinx, if puzzling to his brother officers, was very popular with his men.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304039">So all the afternoon she sat beside him, while he exerted himself to please her—more, perhaps, than he had ever done; the forced laughter died on her lips, and she grew quiet, suffering Hope to hold her hand in his, as she felt for the last time, while the band outside played Waldteufel's 'Au <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304038" n="366     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>Revoir.' The pleasant, swinging air sounded like a dirge to Dorothy Hawthorndean's ears, for to her it was not 
<hi rend="italic">au revoir</hi>, but <hi rend="italic">good-bye</hi>.
</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_214" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304040">'NELL, may I come in?' said Dorothy Hawthorndean two hours later, as she knocked at her visitor's door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304041">'Certainly,' was the reply; and Nell herself opened it. 'Oh, you're dressed already, Dorothy!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304042">'Yes; I dressed quickly, for I wanted to see you,' said Dorothy; then added abruptly, ' Send your maid away, will you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304043">'Of course. Parker, you can come up again five minutes before dinner, to see if there is anything I want. Now, Dorothy dear, what is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304044">Dorothy Hawthorndean had drawn a chair to the window, and was leaning against the sill, her fingers idly pulling off the petals of a great creamy rose that grew just within reach; her dark eyes fixed absently on one of the loveliest views in England, but in which, like the years of life that lay before her, she saw no beauty at that moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304045">'You are better, Nell?' she said at length.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304046">'Oh yes, dear, quite. It must have been the overpowering scent of those flowers that made me faint like that,' she answered, ' after that quick drive through the fresh air.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304047">'I don't think it was the scent of the flowers at all,' said Dorothy in a very quiet tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304048">'What do you mean?' her friend asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304049">'You know, Nell, I came in here last night for a talk—about our engagements.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304050">'Yes, dear '—brushing away at the masses of gold—coloured hair, and avoiding Dorothy's eyes altogether.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304051">'I wanted to hear all about Major Dickson,' Dorothy continued, ' and to tell you all about—Lord Hope.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304052">Nell Vansittart brushed away vigorously without speaking, and Dorothy went on:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304054">'I asked you, Nell, if you were not very happy, and you did not answer. And I said, " Are you still thinking of that other one—that Mr. Brooke—you—were—engaged to—a long time ago?" And you began to cry, Nell-you confessed that you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not forget him, though you had been trying to forget <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304053" n="367     PALLAS ATHENE"/>him for six or seven years—you <hi rend="italic">could</hi> not help loving him still. And though he cast you off without an instant's hesitation because you disobeyed him, yet, if he came to you blind and lame, and deaf and dumb, you would still take him back and <hi rend="italic">adore</hi> him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304055">Nell Vansittart was braiding the gold-coloured hair then, and did not lift her eyes from the broad shining plait. Presently Dorothy continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304056">'I was so sorry for you, Nell, because, as I told you, I believe it would break my heart if anything like that came between Lord Hope and myself; and then I told you that nothing ever could so come between us, because he never would ask me to do anything I did not wish, and I should never dream of refusing to comply with a wish of his. Ah, well, I think you might have told me, Nell, that you knew the whole world was coming between us—yes, I think you might have told me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304057">'I did not know,' Nell broke out. 'You were more likely to know than I. I have been away for three years, and had no idea he had become Lord Hope. And as to the whole world coming between you—why should it do that? Are you so proud, Dorothy, that you will break your engagement because he was once engaged to me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304058">'No; but because he was, and is—and you were, and are—in love with each other, as men and women only love once in their lives,' Dorothy answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304059">'Your love—your feelings——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304060">'Never mind my love or my feelings; the mischief that is done cannot be undone. Do you think, Nell,' she cried scornfully, 'that I would <hi rend="italic">con</hi>-descend to marry a man whose heart was given to somebody else? No—a thousand times no! I should fret myself into my grave in a month. I might have known he cared nothing for me; he only asked me to marry him because he saw I liked him. I ought to have known all along what the absent air and continual deference to my wishes meant—but I did not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304062">'If I had only known,' Nell Vansittart groaned, sinking down on her knees by the table, like a living statue in an artistic attitude, as Dorothy thought, remembering her own little smart, trim figure, that was pretty but not the least bit statuesque. 'If I had only known—if I had ever guessed—suspected that they were one and the same man, I would have <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304061" n="368     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>gone a thousand miles away—I would indeed! I never heard he had inherited a title—I did not know he had the least chance of doing so. Oh, if we had only stayed in New Zealand, then I should have been out of the way of them both! But, Dorothy, though I admit—and in the face of what I, like a long-tongued fool, told you last night, I cannot pretend that it is otherwise—that I love him yet as much as I ever did, I do not, on my honour, believe he cares anything for me. I will tell you the exact circumstances under which we parted. We were staying, all of us—that is, mother, Constance, and I—at Bullidean, with the Gylglens, and Cecil Brooke was there also. One day we went on a picnic, and I somehow slipped into a swollen stream and got up to my waist in water. I tried to laugh it off, and said I must go back to Bullidean at once, when Cecil called out very roughly that I was to do nothing of the kind, but must go into a wretched little cottage at hand and get dried as soon as possible. I dare say he was very anxious; but when I demurred, he said out loud, before everyone, that if I did not do as I was told he would never speak to me again. And I went back. I jumped into the dogcart and drove back six miles to Bullidean by myself, and I never saw Cecil Brooke again until this afternoon. I need hardly tell you, Dorothy, that I repented my foolishness before I had driven half a mile. I was so horribly ill by the time I got to the house that I could not walk upstairs by myself, and I was down with inflammation of the lungs by midnight. My obstinacy nearly cost me my life. But Cecil Brooke never relented in the least; he left Bullidean before dinner, and he never even sent to ask after me. I never heard a word of or from him, from that day to this. Now, do you honestly think that man loved me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304064">'Yes, I am sure of it,' Dorothy answered steadily—'quite sure of it. You see, Nell, it was this way: you called him Mr. Brooke always, and as the Hope family name is Towers, and that of Brooke only assumed by Cecil, it never occurred to me to connect the two. So, when I went into Cecil's room and saw your photograph hanging on the wall, it suddenly came back to me, that though the late lord's daughters and Cecil's brothers are all called Towers, yet I had once heard that Cecil, years before, had taken the name of Brooke to inherit property, and then I knew he was the one you were <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304063" n="369     PALLAS ATHENE"/>engaged to before you lost your voice. So when you came in I did not look at you, for I knew only too well what you thought. I looked at him, and——</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304065">'And——repeated Nell anxiously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304066">'I saw my death-warrant, Nell', said Dorothy Hawthorndean quietly. 'In my own heart I gave him up to you at that moment. There is only Major Dickson to be considered now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304067">At the mention of Dickson's name, Nell broke down altogether.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304068">'I don't know what to do. Dolly—Dolly—Dolly! he has loved me for years—he loves me! He loved me when I had lost my voice and could not speak above a whisper—when Cecil cast me off. I don't know what to do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304069">'You must tell him the whole truth,' said Dorothy. 'I'll tell him if you dare not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304070">'No, Dolly; you have taken too much upon you as it is—more than you have strength for,' Nell cried pitifully, taking her friend's two little cold hands in hers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304071">'I shall pull through somehow.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304072">'And you will hate me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304073">'I think not. Why should I? Did he not belong to you first?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304074">'But George—how shall I face him? I wish I had never been born!' the other broke out passionately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304075">'A very useless wish, Nell,' answered poor Dorothy, freeing her hands and rising from her seat.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304076">'If only George would fall in love with you!' Nell cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304078">A look of intense and utter scorn flashed into Miss Hawthorndean's brown eyes—not at the idea of Dickson as a lover, but at the weak readiness with which the girl, who had once been her friend, caught at any idea which would give her back her old love and leave her free to marry Lord Hope. There was certainly a wide difference between the two girls' characters: Nell Vansittart was the same Nell Vansittart who had refused Dickson's love six years before without the slightest consideration for his feelings in any way; who had cried out, in her weak, passionate way, that if he, Towers-Brooke, came back to her blind and lame, and deaf and dumb, she would still take him and <hi rend="italic">adore</hi> him; there was still in all her actions the same obstinate weakness that had made her shut herself up from the world and lead practically the life of a recluse. Dorothy, looking at her with that mighty scorn blazing in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304077" n="370     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>her eyes, wondered how it had ever come about that a spirit so weak and obstinate had found a dwelling-place in so grand and gracious a person.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304079">And yet a very keen observer of human nature would probably have seen what was preferable in Dorothy Hawthorndean's expression and manner—the straightforward, open, frank gaze of the clear brown eyes; the gay, hearty laughter; the keen, quick wit; the way in which the horses in the stables turned their soft eyes upon her; the way in which dogs tugged at their chains, and little children ran to touch her dress, that they might make their bow as she passed down the village street; the brave, cheery, plucky way in which she could face a difficulty, whether of physical or moral nature: of a truth, she was the same plucky little Dolly who, fifteen years before, had been tumbled off a high wall by the eldest boy, who had picked her up bruised and stunned in an absolute agony of contrition and fright.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304080">'Never mind, Tom,' Dolly said, choking back her tears. 'You didn't mean to.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304081">It is a great many years since a certain sentence was written, but human nature is the same, and it holds good yet—' The child is father of the man.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304082">Dolly Hawthorndean had been a brave, true, fearless child, and she showed herself a brave, true, fearless woman now that the most horrible trouble of her life had fallen upon her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304083">'If only George would fall in love with you!' Nell repeated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304084">'You think I might transfer my affections without any trouble,' said Dorothy. 'Ah! but, you see, it is you whom he wants '—smiling sadly. 'You have won both their hearts; and I, like a lone sparrow on the house-top, am not wanted by either of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304085">'I will have neither of them,' Nell cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304086">'Oh yes,' said Dorothy wisely; 'you will have Lord Hope, and Major Dickson and I will go to the wall.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304087">'It seems very mean to take advantage of your generosity,' Nell said, clasping her bracelets on her white arms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304088">Dorothy wondered bitterly how she could think of bracelets and love-knots at such a moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304089">'But you'll get over it, Dolly dear, and some day you'll be very glad I saved you. You see, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have been in love with him for years.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304091">Evidently the show of resistance was at an end; there <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304090" n="371     PALLAS ATHENE"/>could be no drawing back for Dorothy then; the sacrifice was accepted. She saw that from Nell's sudden change of tone, when she had said so bitterly that she would have Lord Hope, and Major Dickson and herself would have to go to the wall—a change from feeble resistance to absolute possession of Lord Hope, which made Dorothy feel faint and sick.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304092">But she was a brave little woman. She had set herself a task, and she carried it out unflinchingly. Leaving Nell Vansittart, she went down to the drawing-room, where she found Lord Hope alone. It still wanted a quarter of an hour to the time for dinner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304093">'You have a headache, Cecil,' she said, when she had looked at him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304094">'I have, rather,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304095">'Let me cure it for you,' she said, speaking in as unconcerned a tone as if she had said, ' Let me take that bit of thread off your sleeve.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304096">'If you can '—putting his arm round her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304097">'Oh, I can do that'—confidently. 'Hold out your hand.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304098">Lord Hope did so, and Dorothy laid the diamond ring, which had been the badge of her engagement, on the out-stretched palm.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304099">'What does this mean?' he asked with a great start.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304100">'It means, Cecil'—speaking very lightly—' that you and I have made a mistake. Instead of marrying me, you are going to marry Miss Vansittart. She has told me all, and I give you up to her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304101">' Dorothy, do you love me?' he asked, surprise and reproach mingling in his tones.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304102">Dorothy shook her head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304103">'Not a bit,' she returned promptly. The flippancy of her tone was a good deal overdone, but Hope was too much disturbed to notice it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304104">'You don't care for me at all, Dolly—not a little bit?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304105">He had never called her Dolly—the long-disused name of her childhood, by which only her brother Tom ever addressed her; the sound of it very nearly upset her altogether, and she could only shake her head in reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304106">'I thought you were awfully fond of me,' he said forlornly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304108">'Quite a mistake,' said she briskly. 'You asked me, you <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304107" n="372     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>know, and you were Lord Hope, and—and—I thought it a pity to refuse you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304109">'Well, I'll be shot!' he exclaimed blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304110">'There are plenty of other good matches in the world, you know,' Dorothy went on, thinking miserably the while that, if he cared the twentieth part of one poor scruple for her, he would see how put on all this was. 'You needn't think about me. Tell everyone I changed my mind, and that Miss Vansittart took pity on you—be sure you tell Sir Thomas so. I shall like the <hi rend="italic">éclat</hi> of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304111">'<hi rend="italic">Dorothy!</hi>' Lord Hope cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304112">'Your way is quite clear,' she hurried on, afraid every moment that she would break down and betray herself. 'There is only Major Dickson to be considered now, and Nell will tell him herself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304113">'Oh, well, it is better he should find it out now than have got married first,' said Lord Hope coolly. 'I don't believe in a marriage without love on both sides, Dorothy.' And then the door opened, and one or two of the guests came in, creating a diversion—for which Dolly was intensely grateful. Poor brave little woman! She thought no one had ever got mixed up with such a heartless lot before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304114">Then Miss Vansittart appeared, looking gloriously handsome, a smile on her lips, and a blaze of light in her eyes. She was utterly transformed, and Dorothy's aching heart ached yet more for sympathy, when, a few minutes later, Major Dickson entered, in all the flush of his as yet unruffled happiness. She looked at him with curious, pitying eyes, and wondered at the contrariety of human nature—why, when this handsome, brown-skinned, blue-eyed fellow, with the grace and strength that a man has after five-and-thirty years of perfect health; with his frank, winning manner; his dark silky hair, that would have been curly if he had not kept it cropped like a convict; his quick, gracious tongue—why, when he had been openly and honestly in love with her for years and years, Nell could not be content with him, but must needs hanker so persistently after Lord Hope, who had jilted her. And then she looked across the room at Hope, and her heart told her why. Then her gaze wandered back to Dickson, standing by his stately <hi rend="italic">fiancée</hi> with a proud proprietorial air.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304116">'It's very hard upon him, poor fellow!' said Miss Hawthorndean to herself, thinking how soon the happy light would be <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304115" n="373     PALLAS ATHENE"/>quenched out of the blue eyes. 'Yes, it will fall hardest upon him, for he has loved her for years.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304117">She was seated at dinner a long way from either of the spoons. Marchmont took her in, and they sat immediately opposite to Hope, who had taken his hostess in, and had Gwen Hawthorndean on his left hand. Suddenly, in the middle of the entertainment, Gwen noticed he sister's half-hoop of diamonds upon Hope's little finger.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304118">'Why are you wearing Dorothy's ring?' she asked thoughtlessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304119">'Going to buy the wedding-ring to-morrow,' returned Hope promptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304120">Instinctively Marchmont looked aside at Miss Hawthorndean, and saw that her eyes were filled with tears.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304121">'She has given him up,' he thought; and then he added, 'What a heartless brute he is!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304122">But the girl was pluck to the backbone. She turned round to Marchmont a moment later as if nothing had happened. `I thought you were on duty to-day, Mr. Marchmont,' she remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304123">'So I was, but I got leave,' he replied; not adding, as he would have done had they been in the Palace of Truth, that he had asked for the leave he obtained simply because he wanted to see the end of the scene he had witnessed in the morning.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304124">'I see; well, we are very glad you were able to get leave,' Dorothy answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304125">She never once looked at Hope, though Hope certainly looked a good deal at her, noting for one thing that she ate next to nothing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304126">Only once did Dorothy lift her eyes to his before she left the room; that was when she passed him to go to the door. Then she stopped, and said in a very low voice:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304127">'Tell Sir Thomas before he comes into the drawing-room; he will take it better then than at any other time.' Then, before he could answer, she had passed on in the wake of the other ladies.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304128">'Come out on to the veranda,' she said to Nell Vansittart, when they reached the drawing-room. I have told Cecil.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304129">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304130">'I have given him up'—closing her eyes, and leaning her head back against the wall of the house.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304131" n="374     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304132">Miss Vansittart looked at her, but though she saw the worn and weary curves of the mouth, though she knew the girl's heart was breaking, she made no attempt to avert the sacrifice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304133">'You will get over it after a while, Dorothy,' she said by way of consolation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304134">'Well, that is my affair,' returned Dorothy sharply, then rose and went into the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304135">When the men came into the drawing-room, she was not to be seen; but Dickson found Miss Vansittart still on the veranda, and took her away down a secluded shrubbery, to be told his fate.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304136">He had not expected it in the least; he had had no warning that Lord Hope was in any way connected with the Towers-Brooke to whom she had once been engaged; he had, indeed, had no warning that she was still thinking about him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304137">But Dickson, Major of the White Dragoons, had quite as much pluck as Sir Thomas Hawthorndean's daughter; he took his blow like the brave gentleman he was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304138">'Very well, Miss Vansittart, you shall have your freedom,' he said when she had finished her story. ' You and Lord Hope have taken a right royal road to happiness; I trust you will have it. You need not let a thought of me disturb it. I have loved you for years, but<hi rend="italic">you have cured me</hi>. But, if I were you, I should think of the <hi rend="italic">friend</hi>, into whose house you came as a guest, whose happiness you have wrecked.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304139">'I don't think she cares much,' she put in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304140">'Pooh! she adores him—loves him as you don't know how to love—loves him so that she can sacrifice her life's happiness for his. He is making a bad exchange, Miss Vansittart; and he will find it out one of these days. By the heavens above us, she is worth a thousand such women as yourself!' and then he turned away, and she went back to the house alone, and <hi rend="italic">almost</hi> in tears. As for Dickson, he rounded a group of shrubs and walked right into Lord Hope's arms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304141">'You'll perhaps forgive my having listened, Dickson,' he said coolly. 'Very dishonourable, I know; but, you see, I was interested in what you had to say.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304142">'Oh, the whole world may hear it,' returned Dickson defiantly. 'I'll tell you what it is, Lord Hope: you've made a nice mess of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304144">'I beg your pardon,' said Hope quietly. 'I have not made a mess of it at all. Look here, Dickson: you're angry and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304143" n="375     PALLAS ATHENE"/>disappointed and sore, but you'll get over this; and you'd a devilish sight better find it out now than find it out after the knot is tied. I know you're over head and ears in love with her—Dolly told me all about it; but you'll get over it after a while, and then you'll find a woman who is plucky enough to think of someone else besides herself, and you'll be thankful;' and then he gave Dickson's arm a friendly pat and squeeze, and left him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304145">The first person he came across in the drawing-room was Gwen—the second daughter of the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304146">'Gwen, where's Dolly?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304147">'In the boudoir. I think she has a headache,' Gwen answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304148">'Thanks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304149">He found his way to Lady Hawthorndean's special sanctum, speaking to several people as he went; and there, when he opened the door, he discovered Dorothy leaning her head on her hands, with her handkerchief held to her eyes. Hope went coolly up to her and took forcible possession of hands and kerchief.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304150">'Look here, Dolly,' he said with that preoccupied air which had gained him the name of the Sphinx amongst his brother officers, 'this won't do; what do you mean by coming in here by yourself and crying?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304151">'I've got toothache,' asserted Dolly valiantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304152">'You told me yesterday you had never had toothache in your life,' he said, laughing. 'Suppose I try to cure it, as you cured my headache before dinner. Here'—slipping the diamond ring on to her finger—'don't give me that back again; I don't want it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304153">'What do you mean?' she asked, a sudden joy flooding into her eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304154">'I mean that I wouldn't exchange my brave little Dolly for all the Miss Vansittarts in the world. I let it go on because I thought Dickson ought to be undeceived. I gave Miss Vansittart up at Bullidean six years ago, and I have no intention of asking her to take me back again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304155">'But you love her?' Dorothy cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304157">'I beg your pardon—nothing of the kind. I did, Heaven help me! up to this very morning. I loved an ideal Nell Vansittart, who never lived except in my heart. I knew all along that it was only an ideal, but I did not know until within <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304156" n="376     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>the last hour how far below it the real woman was, or how far above it are you. I heard her tell Dickson—and none too sparingly of his feelings—that she had told you all. Well, I felt six years ago that if a woman who professed to love a man devotedly would, because he was anxious about her, flatly disobey him to the extent of risking her life, that was not the woman with whom to be happy. I admit that I glossed her conduct over to myself—that I told myself I had been wrong, hard, all the rest of it; now I say it may have been so, yet I thank God for it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304158">'And you really love me a little?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304159">'Not a little, but infinitely more than I ever loved even the ideal,' Lord Hope replied. 'And so, Dolly, please, we won't have any more headaches, toothaches—which were they?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304160">'Heartaches,' said Dolly in a whisper.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304161">That night Lord Hope took the photograph which had excited his comrade's attention out of its frame, and looked at it long and closely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304162">'Pallas Athene is described as having a face beautiful, thoughtful, earnest and majestic,' he muttered. 'Whatever could I have been thinking of to ascribe all those charms to Nell Vansittart. She has only a very perfect mask, behind which there lurks the most heartless, weak, obstinate soul that ever was called by the name of woman.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304163">The next morning Marchmont strolled in whilst Hope was dressing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304164">'Hallo!' said he, 'what have you done with Pallas Athene?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304165">'Burnt her,' Hope answered. 'Regular auto-de-fé. By George! but the cool way she let that poor devil Dickson down last night sickened me. I realized all in a minute what a fool I have been.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304166">'And Miss Hawthorndean?' Marchmont asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304167">'Marchmont,' Lord Hope answered, 'I'm the luckiest man that ever lived on the face of the earth.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304168">'That's all right,' said Marchmont heartily. 'I'll shake hands with you, if you don't mind, Hope.' And so the two clasped hands, as sometimes men do—hard.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304169" n="377     COMPENSATION"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_220" n="5" type="story"><head>COMPENSATION.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_221" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304170">WHEN Dickson found himself in the railway-carriage, spinning away from Liliminster, he did what perhaps nine hundred and ninety-nine men out of a thousand would have done had they found themselves placed in similar circumstances; he lit a cigar, took off his hat and laid it on the cushion beside him, put his feet on the opposite seat, and said out aloud: 'I'll be damned if I care a button!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304171">But all the same he did care—a good many buttons, rows and rows of them. He had told himself a year or more previously, when smoking in the veranda of the bungalow at Khotah, that he had quite got over his love for Nell Vansittart—that his romance was long since dead and gone, that he could never be so utterly, entirely, hopelessly miserable again—no, not even if fifty Nell Vansittarts should say him nay.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304172">Vain boast! At the very first moment his eyes fell upon his fair-haired stately love, with the pale face and her great dark, melancholy eyes, he had felt the old passion come back upon him with tenfold strength. How he had enjoyed that homeward voyage—every day of it! how insanely happy he had been in that blissful moment when Nell, in a voice no longer whispering, but rich and low and sweet, had promised to be his wife!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304174">Well, the promise was broken now, and Nell had shown him that she cared nothing at all about him. The faithful love of six years had been of no value to her; she had cast his heart away with as little compunction as he himself was accustomed to cast away the end of a cigar, or to knock the ashes out of a burnt-out pipe. It was best, he argued, trying to reason himself in reconciliation with stern truth, that he should have found it out when he did. A mere chance had shown what was the real nature of the woman whom he had loved so long and faithfully; but for that chance the marriage would probably have taken place on the appointed day. How infinitely more terrible would his state have been had he found out the truth after the tying of the knot which can only be respectably severed by death! And then he recalled that it was not only as regarded his feelings that Nell Vansittart <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304173" n="378     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>had been indifferent; she had been utterly indifferent to the future happiness of her chosen friend, Dorothy Hawthorndean.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304175">'Oh, she was a bad baggage!' Dickson muttered with a wise shake of the head. It was true enough, but that was no reason why he should have supplemented his remark by an exclamation of '<hi rend="italic">The</hi> devil!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304176">The remark, however, was not due to his reflections and conclusions concerning Miss Vansittart and her moral qualities, but to the entrance of a second person into the compartment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304177">He had hardly noticed that the train was at a standstill until the invasion of the carriage took place—an invader in the person of a young lady, who laid siege to him immediately. Young ladies, and, for the matter of that, old ladies also, invariably did; indeed, those who knew him well were accustomed to say that it was only his cleverly-managed overwhelming polite air of keep-your-distance-don't-come-too-close-to-me-stand-offishness that saved him from being eaten alive-o right out of hand whether he would or no.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304178">On this occasion, as soon as the door was opened, he announced that it was a smoking compartment, in the hope that the intruder would be scared away by the fact.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304179">Not a bit of it! the invading host got in—a little mild-eyed, soft-voiced creature, who said she didn't mind in the <hi rend="italic">least</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">hoped</hi> he would go on with his cigar, who clasped her hands together with a tragic air when he flung his weed out of the window, and declared he must absolutely <hi rend="italic">detest</hi> her for entailing such a sacrifice upon him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304180">What could Dickson do but grin benignly, and assert it would be impossible for him to entertain any such feelings for her under any circumstances?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304181">Our minor sins frequently plunge us into greater ones. The little stranger made such a fuss about the cigar that Dickson was compelled to change roundabout assertions, which might mean anything or nothing, for untruths of the most flagrant description; for he found himself, before he knew what he was about, declaring that he had but thrown away the end of a cigar, whereas in truth he had thrown away one that was almost entire.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304182">Then she asked him if he would <hi rend="italic">mind</hi> having the window closed, and <hi rend="italic">hoped</hi> she was not putting him to any inconvenience.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304184">Dickson pulled up the window with a smothered curse, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304183" n="379     COMPENSATION"/>and forthwith the little lady began a long history by way of explanation of her request: how she was travelling <hi rend="italic">al—l</hi> alone; how she had a mother and seven small brothers and sisters entirely dependent on her exertions, and therefore was absolutely obliged to have windows and doors closed wherever she went. Yes; she was a singer—Signorina Tankerini—yes, her maestro had advised her to take an Italian name, though of course, as he would have noticed the moment she spoke, she was an Englishwoman; her own name was Dobson—Lucy Dobson. Yes, she had been in Italy five years; she had studied with Lamperti of Milan, believed she might say she was his pet pupil. Dickson rather believed he had heard of a good many <hi rend="italic">pet pupils</hi> of that great maestro, and wondered, with grim humour, if Signor Lamperti would know them if they were presented to him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304185">However, he kept his thoughts to himself, and Miss Dobson Tankerini babbled on, ignoring everyone else who got in on the road—one of the intruders, by-the-by, being Cogner, the Lieutenant then with the depot of the Cuirassiers at Canterbury, who looked at Dickson exactly as he might have looked had he known that he had been married to the little mild-eyed lady that morning, and was just setting off on his wedding-tour—and directing her soft-toned conversation exclusively to Dickson all the way to London town, of course totally unaware that Dickson was provoked very nearly into dropping her out of the window, just to get rid of her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304186">But rid of her he was not for some time. When they reached the London terminus, she implored him to rescue her luggage and procure her a cab; then, just as the cab was going off, would he be so very, very kind as to telegraph for her to Mrs. Dobson, 14, Rossmore Street, Dublin, to say she had reached town safely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304187">'And I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> you won't mind,' she ended. 'You have been so kind, and taken <hi rend="italic">such</hi> care of me. And if <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> you <hi rend="italic">should</hi> happen to hear me sing in public, be <hi rend="italic">sure</hi> you come round and see me. I shall be <hi rend="italic">delighted</hi> to meet you <hi rend="italic">again</hi>. Good-bye—so many thanks.' Then the cab really did go off, leaving Dickson looking ruefully after it, and Cogner laughing at him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304188">'Confound La Signorina Tankerini!' he ejaculated so heartily that Cogner laughed at his vehemence more than ever.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304189" n="380     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304190">But at last his worries for that day were over, and he was free to go off to Long's and enjoy himself as much as was possible under the existing rather doleful circumstances.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304191">It is wonderful how immense a difference circumstances make in us and to us, to our thoughts, ideas, our actions. Circumstances just made all the difference in the world to Dickson's estimation of his comrade, Cogner. During the six years in which they had been officers of the same regiment, he had taken scarcely any notice of him at all, regarding him as a headstrong, racketing kind of lad, not worth the trouble of cultivating as a friend.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304192">But now—now when he had left the regiment with which he had spent sixteen years; when he had not one intimate friend in the country; when he had to go back to a regiment almost entirely strange to him; when he had no Eliot Cardella to gabble to him while he smoked, and take him entirely out of himself; when he had not even Laurie, with his invariable 'I say, Dickson,' with which to begin the multitudinous stock of questions he seemed always to have on hand ready for asking—now, when he was down on his luck, heartsick and miserable, he found the presence of this gay, hotheaded young fellow more of a comfort than he would have believed possible.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304193">As for Cogner, he was perhaps never so surprised in his life as during the three days which followed his meeting with Dickson in the train; and he was not a little flattered that the new-made Major of the White Dragoons had shown such an evident preference for his society, that he cried out loudly against his going to an evening party, to which he had received an invitation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304194">'Oh, come with me; there'll be plenty of room,' he suggested, not being minded to give up his party, for he was a sociably-disposed young gentleman. 'My cousin will be delighted to see you; and I'm sure you'd like her; she's such a jolly little woman, and her husband the best fellow out!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304196">So Dickson was beguiled into going with him to his cousin's party, where, to Cogner's immense amusement, he at once fell into the toils of a vivacious Irish lady—a very small, restless, dark-eyed coquette, with a tongue that went clitter—clatter—clack, like a steam-clapper in a hurry. She took possession of Dickson at once, and rushed headlong into a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304195" n="381     COMPENSATION"/>violent flirtation, of which, as regarded intention and inclination, Dickson was as innocent as the babe unborn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304197">Was he a lancer? She positively worshipped lancers—oh, a dragoon! Ah well, she simply adored dragoons; there was nothing like them. Did he like being a soldier? Wasn't he horribly afraid of getting shot one of these days? She was always sorry when any fellows she knew got shot; it seemed such a bad use to put a man to, especially an officer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304198">Did he know Dublin? She came from Dublin. Where was he quartered? Oh, Carminster! Did he like Carminster? Didn't know it very well. Well, she had heard the girls there were very pretty—at least, she had a second cousin, Mr. St. Patrick Geoghegan of the 400th Foot, who was quartered at Tythebye, only five-and-twenty miles from Carminster, and he went over to a ball given there by the Greys—the Scots Greys, you know—and he said he never saw so many pretty girls in one room in his life. What did Major Dickson think? Did Major Dickson think the Carminster ladies as pretty as the Dublin ones?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304199">Whereupon Dickson, whose head was filled with other things, and who had not followed half her gabble, replied absently:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304200">'Certainly not—not to be compared with them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304201">Oh, well, she was very glad of that, the little flirt went on; she always stood up for everything Irish herself. If he would notice, she was wearing at that moment a dress of Irish poplin, trimmed with Irish lace; she always made a point of doing what she could to encourage the Irish manufacturers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304202">Then, after a moment's pause—o get her breath, as Dickson said savagely to himself—she started off on an entirely fresh track.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304203">What did he think of the campaign in South Africa? Wasn't it all too disgraceful? Wasn't the Isandula disaster too shameful?—not that it was anything compared to the state of things in the Transvaal. Had hoped the Government would go on and let them see what a regular licking meant; but neither Government nor army seemed to her to have any spirit. As to the Afghan affair, for her part, she thought it quite too absolutely ridiculous—all those men been that time in the country, and hadn't managed to conquer a few miserable savages. The whole thing ought to have been Settled up and done with in six weeks.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304204" n="382     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304205">But no; Dickson could stand no more of that; he sent his manners flying to the winds, and told her, without any circumlocution, that she didn't know what she was talking about.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304206">'How you can stand their everlasting jaw, I can't tell,' he said testily to Cogner when they were on the way back to Long's. 'That woman who laid hold of me was more like a jibbering ourang-outang than a human being with a reasoning soul. Lord! I never heard <hi rend="italic">even a woman</hi> talk such drivelling rot in the whole course of my existence—the Afghan business ought to have been settled up and done with in less than six weeks! Well, by Jove! if we'd had three or four hundred women with as much tongue-power as she has, and had let 'em loose in the country, they would have driven every native between Peshawur and Caubool to commit suicide long before six weeks were over!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304207">'You might lay your scheme before the people at the War Office,' said Cogner, with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304208">'I have a very good mind to do it,' Dickson retorted, laughing in spite of himself. 'I say, Cogner, how much leave have you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304209">'Ten days yet.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304210">'I wish you would come down to Carminster for a few days—will you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304211">'Oh, I should like it awfully,' the younger man answered. 'Do you go to-morrow?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304212">'Yes. It's awfully good of you to come.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304213">Dickson breathed a sigh of relief. If the truth must be told, he had dreaded not a little the idea of going back to his new regiment alone, with this trouble hanging over his head. He had only been a week or two at Carminster, and scarcely knew the names of his brother officers. However, now that Cogner had promised to go back with him, he felt that his presence would break the ice for him not a little.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304214">Luckily, on the following day they managed to secure a smoking compartment which escaped feminine invasion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304215">'Heaven be thanked!' ejaculated Dickson devoutly, as the train glided away from the platform; and, as at each station they departed without any of the fair sex as an addition to their freight, he repeated the remark, with even an addition of pious fervour.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304217">'We shall just be in comfortable time for dinner,' he remarked, as they got into Carminster Station. 'Half-past six; <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304216" n="383     COMPENSATION"/>if we had waited till the next train, we should not have been here till nine.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304218">The anteroom was deserted; not even the orderly officer for the day was to be seen.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304219">'Who is on duty?' Dickson asked of the waiter who answered his summons.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304220">'Mr. Lucy, sir.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304221">'Oh! Bring some brown sherry. You prefer brown, don't you, Cogner? or will you have brandy-and-soda?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304222">'No; sherry, thanks.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304223">'They have all gone out to tea; that is evident,' Dickson remarked. 'I never could see the fun of it myself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304224">'Like it,' said Cogner, laughing. As I have said, he was a sociably-disposed young gentleman. 'Always go out to tea when I have a chance.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304225">'I'll tell Lucy. He'll trot you all round the town tomorrow. Faith, I believe he knows every woman in the place! it's like a royal progress to walk down the street with him. Oh, here he is! We were just speaking of you. I don't know if you have ever met my friend Cogner, of the Cuirassiers?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304226">'Er—ya—as,' replied Lucy, in a soft voice of excessive affectation; 'we were togeth—er at—ah—Sandhurst. Very glad to meet you again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304227">'Oh yes; so we were,' said Cogner heartily, as he took Lucy's outstretched hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304228">'And we both fell in love with the same lady,' Lucy continued. 'Her name was Naomi——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304229">'Oh yes, by Jove!' Cogner broke in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304230">'Then, I suppose you both resigned her,' said Dickson, taking his sherry as he spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304231">'Bring me a cup of tea,' ordered Lucy. 'Er—no. She jil—ted both of us, for a lumbering parson like an elephant, whose name was Fligg—Solomon Fligg. I had the pleasure of meeting Mrs. Solomon—er—Fligg last month in Devonshire, the blooming mother of six or seven little Fliggs, all copies in miniature of their estimable papa! And—er—Mrs. Fligg had the bad taste to tell me she thought she had made a Very good match, when she might have had <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304232">Dickson started nervously at the words—just those that Eliot Cardella had used in speaking of Polly Antrobus. Certainly Dickson was getting horribly nervous.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304233" n="384     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304234">'She's about right,' observed Alan Trevor, who had entered in time to hear the little history. 'I've no doubt the Reverend Fligg does make a more comfortable kind of husband than you would do. I rather pity any woman who marries you Lucy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304235">'I don't know,' Lucy returned, stirring his tea round and round with pretty much the same air of reflective wisdom with which a monkey investigates a nut, or a parrot a sop. 'I'm a fool, of course; you fellows all tell me so every day, so I must be. But, then, there is no doubt I' m deuced amiable; and oh, by-the-by, Major, were you going to give Cogner Josselyn's room?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304236">'Yes; I saw Josselyn in town this morning, and he told me to use it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304237">'Ah, well, he'll have to have Desmond's. Josselyn's chimney has been on fire this morning—Heaven only knows why a fire was lighted on such a morning as this!—and all the smoke went down Mrs. Jordon's chimney, and very nearly smothered her and the babies.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304238">'Her and <hi rend="italic">what?</hi>' exclaimed Dickson incredulously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304239">'Oh, don't you know?' cried Lucy, with his ridiculously soft laugh. ' Haven't you heard? No, of course—how should you have done? Why, she's got the bounty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304240">'The bounty?—and what the devil is the bounty?' asked Dickson and Cogner in one breath.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304241">'The bounty is Her Most Gracious Majesty's reward to such of her loyal subjects as increase the population by three at a time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304242">'But you don't mean to say that Jordon has got <hi rend="italic">three</hi> babies?' exclaimed Dickson, positively unable to believe his ears.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304243">'But I do—three babies. I've seen 'em,' Lucy asserted triumphantly. ' It was such a joke. Jordon was here, in this room, just after lunch, day before yesterday afternoon, when in came that ass Jacques, his servant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304244">'"Missus has gort a little dorter," said he, looking at Jordon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304245">'"Ugh!" growled Jordon. "Do they want me?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304246">'"Dorctor says you can storp there a bit, sir," said Jacques; and off he went.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304248">'"Ugh! terrible business, this!" Jordon groaned. "What the deuce am I to do with a daughter, I should like to know? <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304247" n="385     COMPENSATION"/>Daughters indeed, at my time of day! Ugh! it's disgraceful—simply disgraceful!"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304249">'Well, we quieted the poor old chap down as best we could, and the Colonel ordered a liquor-up to congratulate him. Well, just as he was beginning to get jolly and chirpy, in comes Jacques again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304250">'"Missus has gort a little son, sir," he announced, and shut the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304251">'Jordon didn't ask that time if he was wanted, but just groaned out aloud, as if Jacques had announced the birth of a young gorilla or worse.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304252">'"Let's have another liquor-up!" cried the chief. "Ne-ver mind, Jordon; don't be downhearted over it. Happy is the man, you know."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304253">'"Oh, I dare say, Colonel!" returned Jordon crossly. "An empty quiver has suited us very well for ten years; and, at all events, we didn't want it filling at this rate."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304254">'Well, you'd hardly believe it, but within half an hour in came that ass Jacques again, a grin on his wooden face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304255">'"Please, sir," said he, "missus has gort another little dorter."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304256">'The Colonel, who was standing there on the rug, turned round at this.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304257">'"Thank you, my man," said he; "and <hi rend="italic">you needn't announce any more</hi>."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304258">'Ha, ha! awfully good!' shouted Cogner, while Trevor, who had heard the story at least a dozen times before, laughed as heartily as if he was hearing it for the first time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304259">But Dickson, hating all the little tattling gossip with the weariness of years, did not even smile. In truth, he was wondering if he could endure to wrench himself free from the profession that he gloried in. It might not be so bad, he mused, the life of a country gentleman, though, to be sure, lie knew nothing about it beyond shooting and hunting. Time had been when a dream of a pleasant country-house was the brightest that he knew how to dream; but time had changed all that, and he supposed he should have to go on soldiering to the end of the chapter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304261">They went presently to dress for mess, to find the stairs and corridors all laid with matting, and one or two lads coming back from their tea-parties, treading as softly as if death, and not life, lay behind the door over which a thick <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304260" n="386     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>curtain was hanging—for lads in a barrack, whether they are of upper or under crust, are good in many ways; and, besides, little Mrs. Jordon was a favourite. As Dickson and Cogner went along the corridor, a door opened, and a young man appeared, carrying a basket of cut flowers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304262">'Well, Major,' he hailed Dickson with, yet in a voice scarcely above a whisper. 'Glad you're come back. Heard about the poor little woman in there?'—jerking his hand towards the curtained door. 'Beastly shame, isn't it? Yes; I've got some flowers for her, poor little thing! she's awfuly fond of them. And by-the-by, Major, don't forget <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to shout for your servant, will you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304263">'No, I won't,' Dickson answered, passing on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304264">Cogner followed him into his rooms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304265">'By the Lord Harry, but it's a horrible thing to have three babies all at once!' he remarked feelingly. 'My sister has a baby that howls day and night till it's black in the face. Fancy having three of 'em!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304266">'Oh, I rather fancy <hi rend="italic">all</hi> babies don't howl,' returned Dickson, with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304267">'And who is Mrs. Jordon? Quartermaster's wife?' Cogner asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304268">'Oh no! Adjutant—gentleman, you know, but from the ranks. They've been married ten years or thereabouts—as soon as he got his commission. He must be over forty; she full ten years younger, and the very nicest little woman going. All the fellows seem to think the world of her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304269">Poor Dickson! He found barrack life more wearisome endure than ever; the stale jokes seemed more tedious, though Cogner laughed at each one that evening as heartily as if he had never found himself at a mess-table before. Dickson wondered how he could find anything to laugh t at all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304270">He himself was very weary of it all—the big jumps, the quick runs, the pretty girl at such and such a shop, the history of Mrs.—er—Solomon Fligg told over again in Lucy's absurd drawl of a voice, the fresh comments on the trio f babies upstairs, the fresher details concerning what the fellow were pleased to call Mrs. MacCarthy's goings—on—oh, he was so sick of it!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304272">However, the days wore into weeks, and Dickson, who had congratulated himself with comfortable triumph that he could <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304271" n="387     COMPENSATION"/>never be so utterly wretched and miserable again as he had been after Nell Vansittart refused him at York, was yet more and more miserable with each day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304273">He wished he had never left the Cuirassiers; that he had never left India, but was back in the bungalow at Khotah; he even wished that he was still the Captain of F Troop. I think any soldier who reads this will agree with me that, ere a Major wishes fervently he had never attained that step, the tide of his unhappiness must have reached the very full; but Dickson's disturbed mind carried him to wish more even than that, for he came at last to wish that he could die. It is not often, however, that death comes in answer to such wishes. Death was not just then for him, rather endurance—endurance to bear and live through, for he could not get leave, excepting a beggarly three days, not worth mentioning. The daily round, which we have all of us found so irksome at some time or other in our lives—the daily round, which for him consisted of petty cares and worries, such as ought not to have worried him at all: Mrs. Solomon Fligg; the trio of babies; the big jumps; the quick runs. Then the worries and troubles of his work: that fool Fisher, full private No. 625, who couldn't get through a march-out or a field-day without giving his horse a sore back; that ass Smith, full private No. 502, whose real name being L'Estrange, with a courtesy title before it, thought it beneath him to clean his traps and groom his horse properly, and couldn't be made to understand that it was no good his looking to Dickson, as an old friend and neighbour, to clear him of the consequences thereof. Dickson, who was very just, neither could nor would do it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304274">Then there was that scatter-brained, chivalrous idiot Kennedy, full private No. 446, who, having rescued a young and comely girl from the insulting attentions of his sergeant-major, and clinched the matter by marrying her, without leave, be it known, could not be content to leave well alone, but must needs aggravate his superior by every means in his power, and, in the natural course of events, get the worst—very considerably the worst—of it in the long-run, in the shape of sundry reports for insubordination, neglect of duty, breaking out of barracks, and the like, of which injudicious crop he was wont to reap a goodly harvest of cells, shot and pack drill, confinement to barracks, and—for him most severe of all punishments—fines.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304275" n="388     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304276">He was very sick of it all, but he plodded steadily through his round, simply because he did not dare to face a life without some occupation, which would be his lot practically if he left the service. In some—nay, many—respects it was good for him, and yet there were every day certain details to be got through which almost drove him mad.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304277">Time had been when he had been wont to smile at the superscription of certain letters—letters calling his attention to the most private affairs of such and such of his men as happened to have slighted or offended the ladies of their acquaintance; in the old days he had never glanced at the address without a laugh:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304278">'CAPTAIN DICKSON, ESQ.,
<lb/>'F Troop,
<lb/>'Cuirassiers.'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304279">Time had been when he had glanced adown the ill-scrawled pages of abuse with laughter-filled eyes; nowadays he turned to the end for the name, and, finding none, cast the missive to the flames unread. During those dark days, many a literary bullet did indeed find a very different billet to that for which its author had intended it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304280">So the long summer days wore away, and soft autumn took their place. He had some leave, which he spent on Scotch moors, deer-stalking, whereupon certain joints, after enjoying five years of tropical heat, took dire offence at being treated to kilt and wet heather, and proclaimed their dissatisfaction peremptorily in a severe attack of rheumatism, which made him groan savagely to himself that he was getting old, and, in truth, helped him better over his disappointment and wretchedness about Nell Vansittart than anything else on earth could have done.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304281">It was during that irksome illness, which lasted a fortnight or more, that Dickson, in a hesitating kind of way, came once more into possession of his senses. I say <hi rend="italic">hesitating</hi>, because he did not realize the advantages of his position all at once, but a first only discerned a feeble glimmer of light at a long, long distance from him; but it was a glimmer that grew and grew, until it became very respectable daylight indeed, not to be despised because it lacked the glorious sunshine of love which his brief engagement to Nell Vansittart had cast over his life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304283">He thought a good deal about her during that time; he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304282" n="389     COMPENSATION"/>recalled how coolly and uncompromisingly she had turned him adrift; he recalled how utterly indifferent she had been to little Miss Hawthorndean's happiness, and once or twice could not help laughing maliciously to himself when he remembered how Lord Hope had altogether declined to avail himself of the change of programme offered to him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304284">'By Jove!' Dickson chuckled, 'but that fellow wasn't a fool by any means. I remember some man or other saying he was just as clever as daylight, and, faith! he was not far wrong. After all, what chance of real happiness should I have had with such a woman as that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304285">So, by the time he was able to get about again, he was on the mend. My gentle reader, have you ever been in that position? Do you know what it is to have been hard hit—to have had the iron go deep down into your soul—to have been wretched, heart-sick and miserable down to the very soles of your boots, and that mysterious region which we call our hearts? Do you know what it is to see no glory in the sunshine, no beauty in the landscape, to hear no music in the ripple of the river as it laps softly against your skiff, to hear no sweetness in the twitter of the birds or the deep-voiced baying of the hounds, scarcely, indeed, to find any comfort in your dinner?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304286">Have you been through all that? Then surely you know also—for your own sake, I hope it is so—what it is to realize all at once that you don't feel as miserable as you did, that your eyes are beginning to take a less jaundiced view of things in general and women in particular—that, in short, you find you don't care a little hang for anything, and that you are getting over it?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304287">Blissful period! Why, one feels like a body who has got safely through suppressed measles, or something equally horrible—say vaccination that has taken badly. I could, upon my word, write a whole article on the satisfaction and delight of 'getting over it,' and I have no doubt I should find a good many indulgent and sympathetic readers. I would do it, too, were it not that the critics hate anything savouring of moralizing, and I am not going to bore them, if I know it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304289">Well, in plain words, after six months Dickson had got very comfortably over his trouble—hunted and dined and danced, went out to afternoon teas as gaily as any of the others, if not quite so frequently, and, if he had acquired somewhat of a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304288" n="390     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>distaste for sentiment, and a shade more keep-your-distance in his manner to ladies, yet got a very fair amount of enjoyment out of such society as Carminster had to offer.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_222" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304290">DICKSON'S long leave began just after Christmas, and it must be owned that he departed from Carminster Barracks in a very different frame of mind to that in which he had set off for Scotland three months previously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304291">I would impress upon my reader that Dickson was emphatically not a changeable man. In learning that he had, so to speak, broken the neck of his trouble in half a year, it must not be thought he was in any degree fickle. In truth, a more absolutely faithful nature than his did not exist, but it was not any shade of infidelity that made him feel pretty much as he had felt during the time he had been in India.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304292">And yet, though he was not more unhappy, or, as I had better express it, not less happy than he had been, there was decidedly a difference in the state of his feelings. During those years, Miss Vansittart had reigned in his heart a very goddess—unattainable for him, it is true, yet a goddess still. Now his goddess had fallen, as ages and ages ago fell the god of the Philistines. Like Dagon, his goddess was broken, and practically—like Dagon also—she would not bear mending. The difference he felt, put plainly in the vulgar tongue, meant that Miss Vansittart was not worth breaking his heart about, and in coming to that conclusion, between you and me, he was not very far wrong.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304293">It happened that when, late in the afternoon, he was entering his club—the Junior Army and Navy, if you wish to know the exact one—he ran against a man who was coming out of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304294">'I really beg your pardon,' he said hastily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304295">'Don't mention it,' said the other; then added, in a tone of recognition: ' Oh, how d'you do? I don't know if you remember me—my name is Hope.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304296">Remember him! Dickson would have recognised him if they had met at the Antipodes, and a thousand years had passed instead of six months.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304298">'And how are you?' Lord Hope went on civilly, perceiving <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304297" n="391     COMPENSATION"/>that the encounter was evidently not particularly painful to Dickson.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304299">'Oh, very well, thanks. I've just had a nasty attack of rheumatism—sort of thing to make me feel I'm getting old'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304300">'Beastly thing, rheumatism!' Lord Hope rejoined; 'and I should think Indian warmth will have made you liable to it. I suppose you are on your long leave?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304301">'Yes. I came up from Carminster this morning,' Dickson answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304302">'And what are you going to do? Are you engaged for the whole time? If not, you wouldn't like to come to us, would you? At least—that is—I mean—oh, confound it all! if you don't bear me a grudge for that wretched affair last summer, will you come and see us at Hope Rest? We shall be delighted if you will; in fact, Lady Hope has never ceased worrying about you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304303">'Lady Hope is awfully kind,' Dickson replied. 'I don't think I need be worried about—unless I happen to get rheumatism, when sympathy is valuable.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304304">Lord Hope laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304305">'I'm glad you see things in the same light as I do. Depend upon it, what is, is best. I always tell my wife so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304306">'I think so, too,' Dickson rejoined.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304307">I'm very glad to hear it. Well, you know, or perhaps you don't know, that I have left the service. Yes; I didn't quite see dragging my wife about at the tail of a regiment, and she didn't care about it, either. So I sold out, and we are living now at Hope Rest in Devon; we prefer it to the North. Then, Dickson, will you come to us?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304308">'I shall be delighted,' Dickson replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304309">And when—what engagements have you?' the other asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304310">'None at all,' said Dickson, with a laugh at his forlorn condition. 'You see, I was a good while in India, and I haven't gone about much since I came home.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304311">'Then, go down with me to-morrow,' Hope broke in; 'let us consider it settled. Where are you staying? Oh, Long's! Well, I have to see my lawyer at ten to-morrow morning, and go down somewhere about noon; so I'll send my servant round by ten o'clock to let you know the train.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304312">'Very well,' Dickson agreed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304314">Then they parted. Dickson passed into the club, where he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304313" n="392     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>picked up a friend, with whom he dined, and later went to a theatre, so getting through the evening very comfortably.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304315">'I have got over it, thank Heaven!' he said triumphantly to himself over his last pipe. 'If 1 hadn't, the sight of that fellow would have fetched me, no mistake about it; as it was I was very glad to meet with him. How different he looks! Not like the same man, upon my word! I never saw a more hang-dog looking chap than he was that day we went to the White Dragoon sports; but he looks jolly enough now, and I don't wonder at it, when his wife's such an out-and-out thoroughbred as she is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304316">Thus the Dickson who, on the following day, went down into the West with Lord Hope was, if not quite the ultra-contented Dickson who had paid that really tragic visit at Hawthorndean, a very different man indeed from the unhappy Dickson who had mooned about Carminster, disappointed and down on his luck, wishing himself dead, or even that he had never been born. In short, except that he was a trifle more chary of the fair sex, and on occasion a trifle more caustic in his comments when stories of incompatibility of temper and matrimonial <hi rend="italic">vol-au-vents</hi> that had turned out regular hashes were aired at the mess-table, he was just the same Dickson who had been the ruling spirit of the bungalow at Khotah.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304317">'By-the-by, Dickson,' Lord Hope remarked, as they were spinning along between the avenue of big elms which form the approach to the mansion of Hope Rest,' do you know that we are quite alone, except for one of my sisters-in-law? We have a houseful coming next week, though.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304318">Before Dickson could make the polite reply which of course any man would have made, his host pulled up the horses with a jerk, and instantly the door was flung open, and Lady Hope appeared bareheaded at the top of the steps.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304319">'I saw the lamps coming up the avenue,' she called out gaily. 'Why, Cecil, have you brought someone with you? Is it Tom?' shading her eyes with her hand, and peering into the darkness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304320">'No, Lady Hope, it is not,' Dickson answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304321">Lady Hope began cautiously to descend the steps.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304323">'I can't see you a bit; but I know the voice, though I don't know what name to put to it,' she cried, laughing. Then, as the light fell upon his face when he jumped on to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304322" n="393     COMPENSATION"/>the steps, she exclaimed, 'Oh, yes, yes—it is you! Oh, I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> glad! To think of your <hi rend="italic">really</hi> coming to Hope Rest! You are most welcome!'—taking his hand as he reached her side. 'How <hi rend="italic">lovely</hi> of you to come! and we shall have you <hi rend="italic">all</hi> to ourselves, for there is not a soul in the house but Cecil and myself, except my sister Gwen. You remember Gwen, of course?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304324">All this fuss and greeting was very sweet and comfortable to Dickson. Poor fellow! he had acquired a certain bitterness of thought and tone where women were concerned; he made very few exceptions, calling and thinking them all bad in a lump. In the privacy of his own rooms he dubbed them tiger-cats, and when now and then he held intercourse with them, it was in such a polished, glacial kind of way, that the most inveterate flirt in the world could not have flattered herself on having made the least little bit of an impression on him; yet at that moment, when his dainty little hostess led him into the house, telling him, in her odd, breathless, italicized fashion, how more than welcome he was, he actually found himself wishing that Hope had taken the chance Miss Vansittart had offered him, and had left Dorothy Hawthorndean free to be wooed and won by somebody else—meaning, of course, Dickson, Major of the White Dragoons.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304325">'Cecil,' said Lady Hope, going into her husband's dressing-room an hour afterwards, 'do you think he minds much?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304326">'Not a button,' Hope answered, slipping a stud into his shirt-front.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304327">'Well, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> thought so, too—only, do you think he is likely to make it up with her again?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304328">Lord Hope turned and stared at his wife in blank amazement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304329">'Why, Dolly!' he exclaimed, 'he'd never be such an ass as to give her the chance! By Jove! if you'd only heard the cool way in which she turned him off; it made me sick to hear it, for it was just about the most cold-blooded thing you could imagine. Not a word of regret that she had taken him, knowing perfectly well she did not care a toss for him; not a word of his disappointment or yours, but just a dogged reiteration of how he would be sure to meet somebody else some day, whom he would love better than he had ever loved her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304331">'So she told me,' said Lady Hope, thinking how quietly <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304330" n="394     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>and uncompromisingly Nell had accepted her sacrifice, and how gloriously happy she had looked when she appeared in the drawing-room that evening, knowing full well she was about to deal the man who had loved her so long and faithfully the most bitter blow woman can deal to man. ' Well, I hope he <hi rend="italic">will</hi> l soon find someone a <hi rend="italic">great</hi> deal better worth loving than Nell Vansittart,' she ended.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304332">'The quest won't be a particularly difficult one,' returned Lord Hope, with a short laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304333">'What a good thing it would be if he would fall in love with Gwen!' Lady Hope remarked presently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304334">'Now, look here, Dolly,' said Hope, putting his arm round her waist, 'don't you go matchmaking. There's no more dangerous game in existence, you take my word for it. In nine cases out of ten, instead of helping matters on, meddling only puts them off. If the match turns out well, you get no thanks nor credit for it; and if it turns out badly, you get the blame all round. Just let the thing take its own course. If Dickson is to fall in love with Gwen, depend upon it, he will do it. But don't you go meddling, or you'll spoil the whole thing; let Gwen's pretty face do its own work.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304335">Very good counsel, and Lady Hope, being an obedient as well as an affectionate wife, followed it scrupulously; but, unfortunately, Gwen's pretty face did not work the desired spell with the desired speed upon the visitor at Hope Rest that Lady Hope wished.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304336">He seemed very happy and contented there, but he talked almost exclusively to Lady Hope, and if he looked a good deal at her sister, he seemed quite satisfied to do no more. His little hostess, who, so to speak, had knocked Hope into a cocked hat in less than a fortnight, could simply have shaken him. A whole month went by, and he was still at Hope Rest, though visitors had come and visitors had gone—lots of them. True, once or twice he had proposed feebly that his visit should come to an end, but Hope had pooh-poohed the idea of his leaving them; so there he was still, more than content to talk to Lady Hope and to look at her sister.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304337">Lady Hope was almost beside herself. She took occasion one morning to tell him he ought to be married; he would be far happier; it would be just the very best thing in the world for him.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304338" n="395     COMPENSATION"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304339">Dickson agreed with her perfectly, but told her he was especially unfortunate; he had been jilted once, and the only other lady——And there he broke off, leaving her to finish the sentence as best she liked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304340">Then she tried Gwen. She sounded Gwen one very wet morning, when they were sitting together alone in the morning-room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304341">'Gwen,' she began cautiously, 'I think Major Dickson likes Hope Rest.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304342">'I think he does, 'Gwen returned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304343">'He is very good-looking'—as if she had only just discovered that fact.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304344">'I should think he is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304345">Evidently Gwen had found that out long before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304346">'And so nice—so—so pleasant and unaffected,' Lady Hope continued.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304347">'Yes,' said Gwen, smothering back a sigh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304348">'I fancy he has quite got over the affair with Nell Vansittart.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304349">An indignant scarlet flush flamed out on Gwen's cheeks instantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304350">'Oh, I should think so—nasty wretch!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304351">'Why?' inquired her sister mildly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304352">'Why? Nasty, sneaking, double-dealing thing! It's my opinion, Dolly, that faint in Cecil's room was nothing but a sham. I cannot imagine what either of them saw in her, and it's my opinion that they are both very well rid of her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304353">'Yes, if he had found someone else.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304354">'Ah, yes, you are right, Dolly. Now he, of course, judges all women by that one, instead of believing what is true—that not one woman in ten thousand would have treated him as scandalously as that one did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304355">'You would not, Gwen?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304356">'I? I should think not,' moving restlessly about the room, and speaking in reckless, almost defiant tones. 'I only wish lie would give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the chance of treating him differently—of flaking up to him for the scandalous way Nell Vansittart behaved to him. But he will not. He takes good care to keep out of my way as much as possible—naturally enough, too.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304357">' I don't see why. I think, Gwen, if you were a little kinder in your manner to him——'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304358" n="396     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304359">'Oh, nonsense! he would distrust me all the more,' Gwen asserted. 'I should myself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304360">Lady Hope was in despair; nothing seemed any use. Gwen would not lift her finger; and Dickson, poor fellow! evidently had no such thought in his mind. How she should contrive to bring the pair together she simply did not know. She wanted to help them, and they would not be helped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304361">' I will give it up,' she said vexedly to herself. ' I believe, after all, he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> hankering after her yet. Supposing he goes back to her, she would take him quickly enough, but I should never get over it; and after the chance Gwen has had, too!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304362">She sat thinking it over long after her sister had left the room, wondering for the most part why Major Dickson seemed to find such pleasure in watching Miss Hawthorndean. He never appeared anxious to talk to her, or walk or ride with her; but, did she move from one part of the room to another, his cool blue eyes would follow her so approvingly that his little hostess could not imagine why matters progressed no further.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304363">If she had asked Dickson outright why he looked so often at her sister, he would have answered promptly, because she was so pleasant to look at. That was true. Gwen Hawthorndean was a larger, brighter, more graceful edition of Dorothy herself—a good girl, good every way: good to look at, to hear, to know—much too good to make even the moderate amount of eyes at him that Lady Hope would have had her do; in short, she was what Dickson had called her sister, 'an out-and-out thoroughbred.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304364">The idea of falling in love with her had really not occurred to him. The let-down from which he had but just recovered had left him with a decided dread of feminine fascinations and a wholesome horror of sentiment. Then all at once an idea flashed over his mind, that even if dead roses do not bloom again, they yet are followed by other blooms just as beautiful and quite as bright; it occurred to him that it was very senseless to eschew cakes and ale because he had once eaten cake that was indigestible and had drunk ale that was foisty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304366">Not that he came to this wise conclusion by himself; it so happened that, when Lady Hope was engaged in sounding Gwen, Major Dickson was passing through the hall, and, as the door of the morning-room happened to be open, he heard <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304365" n="397     COMPENSATION"/>Miss Hawthorndean's clear voice make a statement—a statement which somehow seemed to stupefy him for a moment, and then set all his pulses beating and throbbing like a lunatic steam-engine trying its best to jump out of itself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304367">'I only wish he would give <hi rend="italic">me</hi> the chance of treating him differently—of making up to him for the scandalous way Nell Vansittart behaved to him,' rang out the indignant tones. Then with a sudden change to sadness, 'But he will not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304368">All electrified as he was, Dickson was yet the very soul of honour; he stayed to hear no more, but bolted into the deserted smoking-room and shut the door behind him. Then he lit up his pet meerschaum and sat down to think it over.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304369">What a difference those few daring, outspoken words had made in him all at once! The burden seemed to have slipped off his shoulders—the burden of loneliness and cynicism which no one but himself knew how very hard he had found to bear. The pleasant dream of a pleasant country-house came back to him with a reality and a sweetness new to him, for its chatelaine to be was something more than beautiful—she was true and frank and brave, and, best of all, he knew from the tone of her voice that she loved him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304370">Just as the pipe came to an end, the gong sounded for luncheon, so he heaved himself out of his chair, straightened his back, put the meerschaum away in its case, pulled up his collar and pulled down his jacket, and gave a glance at himself in the glass above the fireplace, to see if his hair was all right.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304371">'I'll tell you what it is, Dickson, my friend,' he remarked solemnly: 'you're six-and-thirty years old, and the sooner you get yourself settled in life, the better for you; you've no time to waste. Cut the service and put the question to her Plump this very afternoon, and get the whole business out of hand at once.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304373">He had never been given to shilly-shallying; it was not in the man's nature. Having made up his mind, he did not dawdle in carrying his resolution into effect. As I said, he straightened himself up and turned away from the glass, with the old swaggering gesture of his right arm which Eliot Cardella had mimicked so gaily many and many a time, pulling the arm well out of its sleeve, and passing the edge of the hand across his moustache; then he made his way into the dining-room, looking so spruce and smart, with such <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304372" n="398     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>a comfortable smile on his bronzed, good-looking face, such a light shining in his blue eyes, that Lady Hope stared at him in blank amazement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304374">But Dickson did not, as was usual with him at that meal, make for the seat on his hostess's right hand; he took possession of one beside Miss Hawthorndean, quick to notice, as Lady Hope was, that Gwen turned scarlet from chin to brow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304375">'Miss Hawthorndean,' he said presently, 'have you made any engagement for this afternoon?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304376">'No, I have not. I believe Dolly and Cecil are going to call on the Bryants,' she answered; 'but I am not going.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304377">'I wish you would try the Conqueror,' naming one of the horses—a valuable hunter—that he had taken to Hope Rest with him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304378">'Oh, I shall be delighted!' she returned eagerly; for she was a splendid horsewoman, and had been casting longing eyes on the animal in question ever since he had been in Hope Rest stables.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304379">'Then, I may order the horses? Shall we say half-past two?' said Dickson, as composedly as if they had ridden together every day. 'Yes? I hope he will carry you well; he has carried a lady regularly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304380">'Oh, he could not carry me anything but well,' Gwen cried, very much in her sister's enthusiastic way. 'He is such a beauty! To tell you the truth, I've been dying to ride him ever since he came.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304381">'Then, why in the world didn't you say so?' Dickson asked blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304382">'Oh, well, I hadn't quite cheek enough,' she said, with a laugh; then added in disappointed tones, 'Oh, it is raining!—just pouring.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304383">'It may clear up. If not, shall we decide to go to-morrow?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304384">'Yes; but I don't mind a little rain, if you don't,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304385">'It will not clear up this afternoon,' he said, half an hour later, when they had gone to the door to look at the sky; ' we must put it off until to-morrow.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304386">'Yes,' she admitted regretfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304387">'Let us go round to the stables and have a look at the horses,' he suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304389">'Very well'—growing cheerful again, for going to look at the horses was next best to going for a ride. 'Here, help me <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304388" n="399     COMPENSATION"/>into my ulster, Major Dickson'—reaching it from a peg whereon it generally hung. 'Now I'm ready.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304390">Just what Dickson wanted; the opportunity was even better than he had planned, for they found the stables deserted, except for the gees themselves. Certainly he made the most of his time; his worst enemy could not have said that he did not take that particular tide at the flood, for as soon as they got into the Conqueror's stable, he turned round to his companion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304391">'Miss Hawthorndean,' he said coolly, yet with a very gentle tone, 'if the Conqueror carries you well to-morrow, will you accept him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304392">'Will I do what?' she asked, in utter astonishment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304393">Dickson smiled. 'I will put it plainer,' he said, taking her hand in his. 'Will you accept the Conqueror as your horse, and his master as your husband?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304394">The girl's dark eyes opened wide with amazement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304395">'Do you mean it?' she said, after a while.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304396">'I rather think so,' he answered, laughing, and taking possession of the waist as well as the hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304397">'I—I—thought——' she began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304398">'Yes, I know—that I was quite broken-hearted. So did I. But we all make mistakes at times, don't we? The greatest mistake I ever made in my life was when I fell in love with Nell Vansittart; but it is a mistake for which I shall thank God every hour of my life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304399">'Why?' the girl asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304400">'Because otherwise I might never have known you,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304401">'And you really care for me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304402">'Oh, my darling!' Dickson answered, ' I have been miserably mistaken, utterly unhappy. I have wasted six of the best years of my life in worshipping an idol of clay. I have grudged them bitterly, but I do not grudge them now in the least, because they have kept me free to love you.'</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304403">'You see, I was right, after all,' Lord Hope remarked triumphantly, when his wife flew to him with the news. ' I knew it would all come right, if it was to be, without any meddling on our parts. I'm very glad, Dolly—very, very gad. Dickson's a lucky chap if Gwen makes him half as good a wife as you make me.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304404" n="400     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304405">'And Gwen luckier still if he makes half as good a husband as I have,' she rejoined.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304406">Lord Hope was right—she was a good wife. Dickson had privately thanked her for that fragment of a sentence he had overheard, knowing she had done her best to give him his happiness. She was a generous little woman, for she never mentioned the fact to her husband; nor has she to this day breathed a word of it, lest she should seem to be crowing over him; as Dickson said, ' The Hawthorndeans were out-and-out thoroughbreds.'</p></div></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_223" n="6" type="story"><head>OPEN TO THE GARRISON.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304407">SCOTT LAURIE had left the Cuirassiers, having effected an exchange with Kerr, of the Scarlet Lancers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304408">He had taken the step for several reasons: first, because he found the climate of India did not agree with him after that terrible attack of typhoid which had almost cost him his life, and the subsequent relapse which had followed the discovery that Eliot Cardella was also laid upon a bed of sickness; secondly, because, thanks to poor Eliot's legacy, he could now afford to be in a regiment serving at home; and, thirdly, because his elder brother Willy had fallen with his gallant comrades of the 24th at Isandula, and Scott being now the eldest, his father wished him to be within reach. Besides these considerations, he had lost the two friends of his heart, Cardella and Dickson—the latter, it will be remembered, had left the Cuirassiers on promotion to the Majority of the White Dragoons, and had afterwards married Lady Hope's sister, Gwendoline Hawthorndean—after which Laurie found the old regiment scarcely worth living in; and, moreover, he had been seized with an unconquerable detestation of everything and everybody that grew and lived and had its being under the light of Indian skies.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304409">Eliot Cardella's legacy had made life very much smoother for him. At first he had felt and said that it would be absolutely impossible for him to take advantage of the mistake for which Eliot had laid down his life, and he had, as soon as he had heard of Lord Cardella's marriage, written to Lord Mallinbro' to that effect.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304410" n="401     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304411">Lord Mallinbro', however, promptly replied that they all wished the dead man's will to be carried out in its integrity. Lady Mallinbro' wrote also.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304412">'I beg you to have no compunction,' she said, 'in accepting Eliot's property. We can never forget that you were his dear friend, and if only he had been selfish enough to have followed Captain Dickson's and your wishes at the beginning of your illness, we should not now be mourning the loss of the dearest son who ever lived. When you return to England, I beg you will, as soon as possible, come and see me, that I may express to you how completely I hold you free from blame concerning the miserable mistake which cost us our dear Eliot's life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304413">So Scott Laurie came into possession of some five hundred a year over and above his own property, and felt he need not remain in India a day longer. As I said, the Cuirassiers had changed very much; the regiment was positively not the same that he had joined, and he therefore turned his back upon it without any very great degree of regret. Indeed, as soon as he got fairly settled in the Scarlet Lancers, he was glad, very glad, that he had made the exchange; he liked regimental life in England; he had not liked it at all in India since he lost his two great friends. Moreover, as soon as he joined his new regiment, he struck up a great friendship with one Algy Ferrers, otherwise known as Bootles, who suited him in all respects, as he himself put it, down to the very ground.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304414">To Laurie, an intimate friend was neither more nor less than an absolute necessity; he just used to jaw to Dickson like a babbling brooklet, and so now he jawed to Bootles. Bootles liked him, as everyone did; for if not very wise nor yet very learned, there was something pleasant and manly and straightforward about him. He was good to look at, cheerful almost at all times, of a light-hearted, genial disposition, and as entirely true as a fine Toledo blade, which you may bend point to hilt without any fear of breaking.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304415">It happened one afternoon that Laurie, sitting alone in the anteroom, was dawdling over the newspapers, when Bootles entered, followed by the senior captain, Allardyce.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304416">'Oh, here you are, you fellows!'Laurie said, in the cool, fresh, pleasant voice which was one of his greatest charms. 'Well, Allardyce, what's the latest?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304417" n="402     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304418">'Well, now, look here,' returned Allardyce seriously: 'I want you to do something for me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304419">'Really—what is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304420">Bootles stirred up the fire with a grim laugh, and Allardyce proceeded to unfold his tale.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304421">'We're giving a great meeting to-night—a discussion on the merits of drink or no drink, and open to the entire garrison.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304422">'Oh, drink or no drink,' repeated Laurie politely, at which Bootles began to laugh again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304423">'The fact is, the moderate drinkers,' Allardyce went on solemnly, 'are worse to get hold of than the regular sots. There's some hope of a sot, but a moderate drinker is like the fool in the Proverbs; he's vain in his own conceit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304424">'Wise in his own conceit, Ally,' struck in Bootles.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304425">'It amounts to the same thing. We think if we get the moderate drinkers <hi rend="italic">once</hi>, we may get them again, and so make an impression on them; we find such difficulty in getting hold of them at all. Now, what I want you fellows to do, is to come and talk to 'em a bit. You know, Laurie, you've got such a ready tongue, you always make the men laugh when there's any speechifying on hand; and I want you to come and make 'em laugh to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304426">'The devil you do!' Laurie exclaimed. 'Bless my soul, I didn't know you went in for amusement at your teetotal fights.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304427">'A means to an end—a great and ennobling end,' said Allardyce. 'Why shouldn't they be amusing? What did you think we do?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304428">'Oh,' Laurie answered patly, 'I thought you all sat on your thumbs, like the old lady at Lackington school-feast.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304429">'You've got hold of the wrong tale, Scott,' interposed Bootles gravely. 'She never thought of any such wise expedient. Said the parson to her, seeing her looking about vainly for a safe anchorage, "Oh dear, dear, Mrs. Gadabout, I'm afraid you've nothing to sit upon." "Why, yes, sir," said she, "I've plenty to sit upon, but I've nowhere to put it."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304430">'I might use that story up!' cried Laurie, with a laugh. 'Eh, Allardyce?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304431">'Um—ph!' returned the teetotal Captain doubtfully. 'You see, it has nothing to do with the subject in hand. Now, if you will come and talk to them about temperance, why——'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304432" n="403     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304433">'But I ain't a total abstainer,' remonstrated Laurie; whereat Booties picked up a newspaper and laughed immoderately behind its friendly shelter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304434">'But there's no reason why you shouldn't become one,' retorted the other eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304435">'Ah, take it at the flood,' interposed the cool voice from behind the newspaper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304436">'Hey?' said Allardyce sharply (he was not given to the study of Shakespeare). 'Well, but Laurie, you know, it would be the very best thing in the world for you; you wouldn't be the same fellow—you wouldn't indeed. I believe drink to be the curse of this great country. Now look at me, for instance. Two years ago I was a moderate drinker——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304437">'Oh, a <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> drinker!' Laurie echoed, copying his tone; 'were you, now?' at which the newspaper on the other side of the hearth began to shake again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304438">'Yes, sir, I was. And the result? Always had a headache; never wanted to get up in the morning; couldn't eat any breakfast; had a bad taste in my mouth; got inflammation of the coating of my stomach——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304439">'The devil you did!' Laurie ejaculated blankly. 'And all that from <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> drinking? Why, what the deuce do hard drinkers come to?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304440">'To the devil himself,' said the teetotal Captain impressively. 'To the very devil himself, my friend.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304441">'What's he like, Allardyce?' came from behind the newspaper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304442">'Hey?' said Allardyce, puzzled again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304443">'What's he like? To look at, you know?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304444">'How on earth should I know?'—testily. 'Well then, Laurie, you'll come down to St. George's Hall to-night and say a few words to them, won't you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304445">'I'll go, too, if you do, Scott,' said Booties.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304446">Captain Allardyce brightened up considerably. To secure two such distinguished converts in one day was a treat which did not often fall to his share.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304448">'Now, that's real good of you, Booties,' he said heartily. 'Come and hear us—that's all we ask. Give us a fair hearing, and if we can convince you and get you to join us, why, only think of the splendid examples you will be to the men—you two fellows are so awfully popular—and, besides, just think <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304447" n="404     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>how much better it will be for you both, in every way—no more headaches—no——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304449">'I thought <hi rend="italic">you</hi> were in bed with a headache all yesterday,' interrupted Bootles ruthlessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304450">'That was a <hi rend="italic">sick</hi> headache—I'm subject to them,' returned Allardyce promptly, and with a certain air of dignity which sent Bootles off into roars of laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304451">'Oh, you be shot, Allardyce!' in indignant remonstrance from Laurie. 'I thought I was going to get rid of my sick headaches. Heaven knows, I'd turn total abstainer, or total anything else, to secure that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304452">'I dare say you would find total abstinence go a long way towards getting rid of them,' replied Allardyce soothingly. 'Well, I'm off to the Colonel's quarters; he half promised to look in to-night, and I want to make sure of him. Then, let us leave it this way, Laurie: you'll come and hear what we've got to say—hear all the witnesses for and against—and if you feel like speaking, you'll do so, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304453">'All right,' Laurie returned good-naturedly; then added, as the senior Captain closed the door behind him: 'What an ass he is!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304454">'Makes a deuced bad pleader,' Booties returned; 'not but what teetotalism is a good thing for him. Moderate drinker indeed! By George! he used to drink like a fish, or the great sea-serpent that hadn't had anything to drink for a month. He's given up spirituous liquors of a certainty, but how much better it can be for a man to drink fifty cups of strong tea or homœopathic cocoa in a day, passes my comprehension. The fact of the matter is, he don't drink a drop less, only he has diminished the quality.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304455">'Will he get the Colonel to go?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304456">'He may, if only for the fun of it. For my part, I call it deuced selfish to try and dock the men of their liquor; not one of them has the means of drinking as he used to do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304457">'No, poor devils!'—pityingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304458">It was just seven o'clock that evening when Bootles and Laurie got out of a cab and entered St. George's Hall, where 'the great military drink or no drink discussion, open to the garrison,' was to take place. Captain Allardyce welcomed them vociferously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304460">'Glad to see you, my dear chaps!' he gushed out, his nose through excitement being redder than usual, and doing quite <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304459" n="405     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/>a pleasant little rivalry to the vivid scarlet of his mess-jacket. 'Come up on the platform.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304461">'Oh, I'm not going up there,' answered Laurie, drawing back.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304462">'Nonsense! I've got the Colonel to keep you in countenance, and half a dozen other fellows.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304463">'But I'm <hi rend="italic">not</hi> a total abstainer,' Laurie remonstrated vigorously. 'Confound it all, Allardyce, you know very well I am not an abstainer of any kind.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304464">'We want witnesses on both sides of the question,' was the solemn reply. 'We show that way how fair and above-board we are.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304465">So Laurie, followed by Bootles, was marched up the great hall, on that occasion filled to overflowing by a fair sprinkling of ladies and a regular crush of uniforms of every rank and regiment in the garrison. As soon as the men of D and H Troops caught sight of their respective captains, a ringing shout went up, quickly joined in by the whole assembly.Bootles remained as cool and collected as usual—in truth, thoroughly enjoying the situation; but Laurie, blushing up to the very roots of his hair, and with a general air of shamefacedness, looked just as he felt—as if he would have given a hundred pounds to find himself anywhere but in the midst of that crowded assembly, gathered together to discuss the great drink or no drink question in St. George's Hall. However, when he found himself brought to an anchor in the very next chair to the Colonel, with whom he was an immense favourite, he cooled down a little, and the careless flippancy of manner natural to him returned, and he remarked:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304466">'I say, Colonel, you haven't turned teetotal, have you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304467">'No, I haven't,' the chief replied with a laugh; 'but you have. At least, so Allardyce has been telling us; he says he never met with two more promising cases in his life than you and Ferrers.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304468">'Did he say that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304469">'Really.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304470">'What, out aloud?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304471">'Out aloud? Rather—at the top of his voice, off this very platform.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304473">At this point Bootles laughed—he always did laugh at a critical moment—little short 'Ha, ha!' which somehow invariably had the effect of sending everyone in his immediate neighbourhood into fits, while he himself remained as grave as <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304472" n="406     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>any judge is popularly supposed to be. For once, however, the irresistible 'Ha, ha!' proved a failure, for Laurie, looking as black as a thunder-cloud, doubled up his fist and made a remark <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi> at Allardyce's scarlet-clad back, which made the chief laugh as if he was going to choke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304474">'You brute!' Laurie muttered vindictively; 'but, by George! I'll pay you out for this by-and-by, see if I don't!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304475">Allardyce was the first to speak—he was in the chair, in fact, and opened the proceedings. He carefully explained that the speakers on the great drink or no drink questions were expected, and indeed begged, to speak from the heart.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304476">'Or the coating of the stomach,' murmured Booties, from his place just behind the Colonel and Laurie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304477">'It was no use coming there unless they did so speak. He would give them his experience—he believed in no drink. He believed if there was no drink there would be no wickedness in the world. He believed people would live twice as long as they did; he believed people would be twice as rich; he believed people would be a million times as happy. He knew <hi rend="italic">he</hi> had been a hundred million times happier since he gave up drink entirely and became a total abstainer. But,' he ended, 'they had most of them heard him many times—he was not a good speaker——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304478">'That you certainly are not,' remarked Bootles in the background.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304479">'He had not the gift of a ready tongue, he knew it. He would therefore sit down; but before doing so, he would call upon his friend Mr. Joppling to say a few words.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304480">Mr. Joppling was a Quartermaster, a thick-set, beetle-browed personage, who spoke slowly, and seemed to be struggling with gum jujubes all the time. He began:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304482">'Captain Allardyce—ladies—and—gentlemen——' Long pause. 'I'm a total abstainer. I've been a total abstainer for eight years——' Here a slight difficulty arose with the gum jujube, at which Bootles remarked that he had never before given Joppling credit for arts and sciences in the dentistry line. 'There are many people in this country who are not called drinkers. I say they ARE drinkers'—thumping his hand on the railing of the platform with a force that threatened to bring the whole concern down bodily. 'I repeat it—they ARE drinkers. A man cannot be more than sober. If he ain't got any drink in him, he's sober. You'll all agree <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304481" n="407     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/>as to that. Well, if a man has drink in him, he cannot be sober; and if he is not sober, he must be drunk. My friends, have you ever <hi rend="italic">con</hi>sidered that if you drink a single glass of beer or toddy you must be drunk? But it is so. There are no degrees of sobriety; then there ought to be no degrees of drunkenness; a man is either drunk or sober—he can't be a <hi rend="italic">little</hi> sober; then, neither can he be a little drunk. It is true that we often hear a man called "a bit fresh," or that he was "in liquor, but certainly not drunk." My friends, if we were quite honest, we should say he was quite intoxicated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304483">'But that, my friends, is only one side of the question. Drunkenness is not only bad, and wicked, and injurious, it's extravagant and wasteful. Let me give you a few statistics on the subject.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304484">'By George! if they drop out,' muttered Bootles, who had a good side view of the speaker, and had been watching him anxiously from the moment he had risen to his feet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304485">Laurie grinned at the idea of it, and somehow the grin spread amongst the men of his own troop down below, and there was a general jogging of elbows and passing of remarks—'as 'ow there'll be something worth hearing when the Capt'n comes to the front.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304486">Mr. Joppling continued, referring to a paper every now and then:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304487">'Er—This town is situated a hundred and fifty miles from the Metropolis; the rail passes through seventeen towns of over thirty thousand inhabitants, twenty-five of over fifteen thousand, thirty-two of over five thousand, and thirty-six villages, in the aggregate comprising upwards of one hundred and thirty thousand souls.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304488">'That's a lie!' muttered Bootles calmly; while the grin on Laurie's face spread thereon, and, like the little leaven which leaveneth the whole lump, increased the grin in the audience to audible sniggering.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304490">'If all the public-houses, dram-shops, spirit-vaults, gin-palaces, bars, and inns to be found in those forty-seven towns and thirty-six villages, containing in all one million one hundred and fifty-five thousand souls, were placed in a straight row from London to Chertsey, they would line both sides of the railway without intermission. What do you think of that, my friends? I will give you a more striking proof still of the wastefulness of drink. If all the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304489" n="408     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>money that is spent in England alone during one year, not comprising Scotland and Ireland or the colonies, were given to pay the National Debt, in two years <hi rend="italic">we shouldn't have a National Debt at all</hi>.'
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304491">Immense clapping from the total abstainers greeted this, under cover of which Bootles remarked that if all the lies Joppling had ever told could be laid in one straight line—'and we shouldn't have to stretch it tight, by any means'—they would reach from St. George's Hall, Chertsey, right to a certain warm, not to say sultry, clime, which it wouldn't be polite to mention.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304492">'I ask you to look at facts—nothing but facts,' the Quartermaster went on, forgetting his hesitation. 'In setting these statistics before you, we build your convictions on a rock. Can any of you in this hall to-night, who pride yourselves on being moderate drinkers, lay before us any such facts as these? No; I say, no—most emphatically, <hi rend="italic">NO!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304493">After this oration, he sat down, flushed and triumphant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304494">'Splendid speech,' whispered Allardyce; 'it has taken tremendously.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304495">'I should like to say a few words, sir,' said a sergeant, who had been standing below the platform, 'if quite convenient.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304496">'Of course—of course! Come up—come up!' Allardyce exclaimed excitedly. 'Come up at once; why have you not been sitting here all along? Come up and speak out; don't be afraid to say just what you think—just what comes from your heart. Ladies and gentlemen, Sergeant-Major Carnaby is going to say a few words to us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304497">Sergeant-Major Carnaby stepped forward, a fine, well-setup lancer, with smooth brown hair and a pleasant, sensible, shrewd face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304498">'Captain Allardyce,' said he, 'Colonel Wilson, ladies and gentlemen: This is a meeting for the discussion of drink or no drink. The chairman has invited anyone on either side to step up and bear witness, either for or against. I'm not going to make a speech; I can't do it; it ain't in my line; I leave that to my betters. But I want to tell you a few <hi rend="italic">facts</hi>. The last speaker asked you to believe facts—to build your convictions on a rock; and a very good thing, too, if you only knew how to do it.' (Laughter.) 'Well, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to do the same thing—to listen to facts.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304499" n="409     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304500">They ain't facts about numbers—which I'm sure there's very few here could add up without a paper and pencil.' ('Hear, hear,' from Laurie.) 'They're facts I think the very youngest here'll be able to understand; and as for them that are about Myself—why, my Colonel's set here behind me and the Capt'n of my troop; if I'm wrong in what I say, I hope they'll be kind enough to correct me'—with a bow to the chief and Bootles, who both bowed gravely back again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304501">'Well, the first fact I have to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, is, I'm 'ight-and-twenty years of age. I've been 'ight years in the Scarlet Lancers, and I'm Sergeant-Major of D Troop. That you all know, who know me at all. <hi rend="italic">I say I'm one of the best soldiers in the regiment</hi>.' ('Hear, hear,' from Bootles.) 'I've never been in trouble of any kind but once since I joined the regiment, and that was for giving a chap a good hiding for kicking a woman. I'd do it again to-morrer. You ask my Colonel—he's set here to my left, and has promised to speak up for me if need be—and he'll give me a good character. I'm the best hand at tent-pegging in the regiment, and the best shot, except the Colonel himself; and I'm like him—I'<hi rend="italic">I'm not a total abstainer</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304502">'Hurr—ay!'—from the 'drink' side of the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304504">Ladies and gentlemen, I've got the Victoria Cross on my breast, and I'm prouder of it than of anything I possess, but I didn't win it on total abstinence; I won it on a drink of brandy. My Colonel 'll bear me witness, and I'll tell you how it was. The Colonel and me, and a private called John Morris—he's over there by the door—were outside Bloemschesgracht Camp one morning, perhaps half a mile away. Well, we were surprised by half a dozen Boers, who fired upon us, shooting my horse dead as a door-nail, and not only putting an end to the Colonel's horse, but breaking his ankle-bone. Did any of you ever break your ankle-bones, ladies and gentlemen? Them that have 'll know without my telling 'em what it's like, and them that haven't 'll perhaps be content to take Colonel Wilson's word for it that it's as bad a thing almost as can happen to you. You'll all be able to understand that, with his leg disabled in that way, he could not walk a yard. Well, we were just going to get him on to Private John Morris's charger, when down it came to the ground with a smash; it was done for, poor beast! Well, what was to be done? Colonel Wilson <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304503" n="410     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>was helpless, couldn't walk a yard, and the pain in his leg was well-nigh too much for him. We were half a mile from camp. As I just told you, I'm a good shot. I asked the Colonel for his revolver, wanting to keep mine in reserve, and I let fly a couple of shots at the Boer gentlemen, reducing their number from six to four. "Now," said I to John Morris, "you hold this, and help me to get the Colonel on to my back." Of course, it would have been a good deal better if John Morris could have carried the Colonel, and I have done cover for them, for I was the best shot of the two. But that couldn't be. Colonel Wilson stands over six foot in his socks, and he's not a skeleton, by any means. Private John Morris, though as plucky a one as ever drew breath, is only just up to regulation height, so said I to him: "Help me up with the Colonel, and cover us as best you can, and I'll run my hardest." But the Colonel wasn't for doing it. "Just put a bullet through my head, Carnaby," said he, "and run for your lives both of you, as fast as ever you can lay legs to ground."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304505">'Well, you can believe, ladies and gentlemen, I didn't take much notice of that; he was disabled, and I was commanding officer then.' (Great laughter.) 'So we got him up somehow. I'm afraid it was rather rough handling, but we'd no time to spare, and I was determined not to let the Boers have him; and then we ran. I never knew what it was to ride twelve stone before; it was hard work, and I don't mind owning now, ladies and gentlemen, that I was in a blue funk the whole of the time. I kept counting the shots behind me, and wondering if Morris's revolvers would hold out without reloading till we got in. "I've killed one chap," I heard him say, as he ran after me, and just then I got the Colonel up against a tree, for I couldn't go a step farther.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304506">'Says the Colonel, "You can't do it, Carnaby. What's the good of risking three lives for one?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304507">'"Now, for God's sake, sir, don't slip down," I answered; "I only want a minute to get my breath." But I don't mind saying <hi rend="italic">now</hi> that I knew them three Boers were desperate, and how I should cover the distance—only two or three hundred yards—between us and the nearest outpost, which meant safety, I'll be shot if I knew. "What are you doing, sir?" I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304509">'"I've got my brandy flask shoved into the band of my <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304508" n="411     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/>overalls,"he answered; "but I can't get at it. Oh, here it is."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304510">'I don't think I said "Thank you " for it. I'm sure I never offered John Morris a drop. That flask was emptied down my throat before you could have said "Jack Robinson"; and then I buckled to again, and never stopped till I'd put the Colonel down inside the fortifications. And there he is, alive and well, and all owing to that drop of brandy; I couldn't have saved him without it. As it is, Private John Morris and me have both got the Victoria Cross, and Colonel Wilson has got what's of a good deal more value to him—his life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304511">After the immense and vociferous applause which greeted this recital, Colonel Wilson rose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304512">'I am not going to make a speech, Captain Allardyce, ladies and gentlemen,' he said, 'because I have an engagement in twenty minutes from this time, which I must keep. I wish to add to Serjeant-Major Carnaby's story a fact which his modesty did not permit him to tell you: that, when my horse fell, he received a severe kick, which, though fortunately it did not break the bone, yet laid open the flesh from knee to ankle, and must have given him the most intense pain during that long half-mile, when he carried me on his back from death into life. A braver man and a better soldier than Sergeant-Major Carnaby does not exist in my regiment or any other. He, like myself, is a moderate drinker, and he never, to my knowledge, was worse for drink in his life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304513">Amid tumultuous applause, the Colonel betook himself away, and before the disappointed chairman could put up another anti-drink man, a grizzled old regimental Serjeant-Major got up and asked if he might say a few words also.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304515">'Captain Allardyce, leddies an' gentlemen, ye've been asked to beleeve some varra woonderful facts this nicht,' he began in the varra braidest o' Scotch; ' will ye no beleeve mine? They cam' under my ain pairsonal knowledge. I kenned a mon wha was a sair haird drinker; he waur a civeelian—a mon making his twa pound a week, an' whiles as mony as three. But he drank, an' he drank, an' he drank, an' at the last the meenister o' his parish up an' spak' tae him; an' says he, "Sandy, my mon, ain' o' these braw days ye'll be ganging tae a braw an' bonnie place, whaur there'll be rivers o' whusky an' moontains o' bread an' cheese rinning doon wi' torrents o' spairkling gin, amang rocks o' scones an' still, quiet tarns o' <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304514" n="412     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>pease brose. It'll be a gey braw an' bonny place, my mon, an' hoo d'ye think ye'll fare in it?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304516">'"I'll fare richt weel, meenister," said Sandy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304517">'"D'ye think sae? An' what if I tell ye that for aye an' for aye an' for aye, through a' the coontless ages o' etairnity, ye'll sit eyeing them rivers o' whusky an' them spairkling torrents o' gin, an' the braw bread and cheese, an' the scones, an' the pease brose, <hi rend="italic">an' ne'er a drop or a bite 'll pass yer lips;</hi> but ye'll go on for aye an' for aye an' for aye, aye craving and longing, an' ne'er able tae satisfy the coorse animal appetites ye mad' yer gods i' this warld.

An' so he did; he becam' a total abstainer. Weel, at the end o' three moonths he had saved enough out o' his weekly wage to buy a plot o' land.' ('Hurray!' from the no-drink side.) 'An' at the end o' six moonths he waur ready tae build a hoose on that plot o' land; and at the end o' nine moonths he waur ready tae put a greenhoose outside o' that hoose; an' at the end o' a twalvemoonth he waur ready tae build a stable tae that hoose; an' at the end o' fifteen moonths he waur ready tae buy a canny little galloway tae put into that stable.' (Immense applause.) 'An' at the end o' a year an' a half, my freends'-speaking very slowly and impressively—'<hi rend="italic">he—waur—ready—for—his—COFFIN</hi>. Ay, my freends, total abstaanance didna agree wi' that mon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304519">I need hardly describe the scene, need I, gentle reader? You may imagine how the audience roared and stamped and shouted. You can imagine how the keen whisky-loving old Scot, who had told the story, beamed and chuckled over the utter and complete sell at the end of it. Even the enthusiastic chairman laughed till he was purple in the face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304520">However, as soon as he had recovered himself, he got up and said it was a very laughable speech, but not logical, at which a voice from the body of the hall called out, 'We don't want logic; we want facts.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304521">'The meeting's a dead failure!' Allardyce exclaimed in an agony to Laurie, who had long since given up all idea of revenge.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304522">'I don't think so,' Laurie returned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304524">But Allardyce was right; as regarded the no-drink side of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304523" n="413     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/>the question, the discussion was an ignominious failure. The people, especially the men of the Scarlet Lancers, had got roused, and were determined to have their fun. Seeing the chairman in consultation, as they thought, with two of their favourite officers, they called for them loudly, and Laurie was eventually half pulled, half shoved forward.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304525">He made his bow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304526">He said: 'My friends, I come forward very unwillingly to speak, because, on my word and honour, I have not got anything to say. I am like one of our royal princes—I have said everything that has occurred to me on the subject. I said it this afternoon to Captain Allardyce. But here I am, pushed forward to say something, so I will tell you what passed this afternoon between Captain Allardyce and myself. I assured him that I am not and never have been, a hard drinker; I am a moderate drinker. Just at present I may say I am a total abstainer. I have had one glass of beer to-day. Now, according to Mr. Joppling's theory, I was drunk at some part of the day, but I must claim to be absolutely sober now; it was just one o'clock when I had that glass of beer.' (Laughter.)</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304527">'Well, I am a moderate drinker—I own it. Captain Allardyce says he, too, used to be a moderate drinker, and he says that even moderate drinking leads to very bad results—constant headaches, unwillingness to get up in the morning, bad taste in your mouth, inability to take your regular meals, inflammation of the coating of——' But this was lost amid roars of laughter, and it was some minutes before Laurie could make himself heard and continue.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304528">'I tell him I never had any of these bad things, and then he says, "See what a splendid example you can set!" A splendid example! I not only can, my friends, but <hi rend="italic">I do</hi>. I let my moderation be known unto all men.' At this, renewed screams of laughter rang through the hall, and Laurie had again to wait a few minutes before he could go on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304531">'We have been told to-night,' he continued at length, 'as a warning to moderate drinkers, that if a man drinks but one glass of beer he is on the highroad to killing himself with drink. I say, my friends, you might as well say, because a man keeps a horse and cart, he is on the highroad to ruining himself on the turf.' (Loud laughter and applause.) 'Or I'll give you another instance. Let us suppose that a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304529" n="414     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>man sat down to a good dinner—say, a well-cooked sirloin of beef, with plenty of gravy, new potatoes, and a dish of green peas, all served up nice and hot, and a pint of good bitter beer to wash it down. Now, if that man, instead of eating a moderate dinner, ate <hi rend="italic">all</hi> that was set before him, till he did not know where he was nor what he was doing, nor what his name was, nor where he lived, and, generally speaking, made a beast of himself, would that be any reason why <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> people, who would content themselves with a good plateful and no more, should be starved to death? I think not. At least, that's not my way of looking at it. But mind, I say if there is a man who cannot keep off drink, and really does not know how to stop when he has as much as is good for him, let that man take the pledge and stick to it. If there are any here to-night who cannot resist that particular form of temptation, come up here and sign the pledge, and, believe me, you'll be all the better for it. But if you do, don't turn round in a few months and say all drink is bad—it is not The bad is in those who abuse the use of it. Beer and wine and spirits are all good in their way, but if the use of them is abused, why, like many other good things, they become injurious. Now, for instance, suppose a man was suddenly to take to drinking water by the bucketful, what would be the effect? Why, he would get the dropsy.' (Laughter.) 'I see Dr. Murphy laughing at me. Well, perhaps it wouldn't be the dropsy; but, depend upon it, it would be something very horrid—we'll get Dr. Murphy to come up here and tell us what he would get. Or I'll take another line: There are many sailors off on long voyages who get the scurvy from eating nothing but salt meat. Poor fellows! it used to be a much more common thing than it is now—very bad it must be—but will anyone here have the assurance to get up and tell us that neither you nor I shall touch a slice of salted meat again, because some men have got the scurvy from eating too much of it? If anyone did, we should simply laugh at him. So with this great drink discussion. It is a bad—a very bad thing to be a drunkard—it is a <hi rend="italic">contemplible</hi> thing; we must all agree that it is better, infinitely better, to be a total abstainer; but I maintain, my friends, that it is better still to be a moderate drinker; better, it is best of all. A moderate drinker, who can take a glass of beer or wine or spirits, and not want to go and get drunk straight away; not <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304530" n="415     OPEN TO THE GARRISON"/>one of your so-called moderate drinkers, who are at it furtively all day long—a B. and S. instead of the morning cup of tea—a pick-me-up here—a nip of whisky there—and who manage to spread as much liquor out over the day to have got jolly well screwed on if they'd taken it all at once. When I say a <hi rend="italic">moderate</hi> drinker, ladies and gentlemen, I don't mean one of them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304532">As Laurie sat down, the great hall fairly shook again with applause, Captain Allardyce clapping his hands as loudly as anyone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304533">'A splendid speech!' he told Laurie; 'but you hit some of us very hard, Laurie—very hard indeed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304534">'Specially Allardyce himself,' murmured Booties in Laurie's ear. 'By Jove, Scott, but you did wake 'em up! I hope they don't expect me to get up? I'd hammer and stammer like a schoolboy who hadn't learnt his lessons. I say, let's be out of this'—pushing his chair back and slipping off the platform, followed by Laurie, rather ashamed then of the long speech he had been drawn into making.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304535">'It was the most killing thing you ever heard!' Bootles remarked, for the information of the officers still left in the anteroom. 'Upon my soul, Sergeant-Major McDougall's yarn was inimitable. "Eh, Sandy, my mon, but there'll come a braw day, when ye'll gang tae a gey braw and bonnie place, whaur there's rivers o' whusky an' moontains o' bread and cheese, rinning doon wi' torrents o' spairkling gin, amang rocks o' scones an' still, quiet tarns o' pease brose; an' for aye an' for aye an' for aye, through a' the coontless ages o' etairnity, ye'll sit eyeing them rivers o' whusky an' them torrents o' spairkling gin, an' the braw bread an' cheese, an' the scones an' the pease brose, <hi rend="italic">an' ne'er a drap or a bile 'll pass uer lips;</hi> but ye'll gang on for aye an' for aye an' for aye, aye craving an' longing, an' ne'er able tae satisfy the coorse animal appetites ye mad' yer gods i' this warld." Upon my word, it was the most tangible idea of everlasting punishment I ever heard put into language, and poor old Ally looked as if he felt he'd had a deuced narrow escape.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304536">'So he had,' someone laughed.

If by any chance the principal speeches were not original, but only cribs from printed matter, I wish to say that I am absolutely ignorant of the fact, and that they came to my knowledge by word of mouth only.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_224" n="7" type="story"><head>THE VANITY OF BOOTLES.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304539">IT was well known among the Scarlet Lancers that Bootles had a vanity; he was, however, and rightly, only credited with one—the one generally spoken of as ' the vanity of Bootles.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304540">The vanity of Bootles had nothing whatever to do with approbation of his own person, for he was not in the slightest degree self-opinionated, nor did he consider himself in the least good-looking. It did not consist of gay attire, for he was almost always the plainest and neatest of dress in the regiment. He never bloomed out in checks or stripes, as some of the others did; he never wore fantastic-coloured shirts; and his cotton cravats, in hue of Cambridge blue, if they did not happen to be white, were always fastened by the same pin—he had worn it the day he joined—a simple little ball of lapis lazuli, the size of a small pea, which he had given fifteen shillings and sixpence for one day in a shop in Bond Street, and had worn ever since. His watch-chain was a plain cable of average thickness, and carried at the end of the drop-links a little gold locket, with two initials graven on one side and a date on the other; the initials were R. W., and the date that of the day on which Kerr had gone into his room and had asked him why the handsome widow, Mrs.Smith, had been crying? Within the locket reposed a tiny curl of silken hair, which Mrs. Smith had clipt for him from Mademoiselle Mignon's head, as she lay sleeping her long last sleep.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304541">But this vanity? Well, to tell the truth at once, it consisted of rings—four of them: four broad gipsy rings, each set with three immense diamonds, neither Cape nor of Brazil; but genuine white, lustrous gems of Golconda, for which their owner had paid close upon a thousand pounds, and was considered by certain of his friends who were up in such matters to have got them cheap at that.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304542" n="417     THE VANITY OF BOOTLES"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304543">At first he had been a good deal chaffed about them, but as years passed by, and he became one of the elders of the regiment (being next to Allardyce, who was the senior Captain), the Scarlet Lancers grew accustomed to his vanity, and never thought of noticing it or alluding to it in any way, though occasionally Bootles' rings were mentioned, quite as a joke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304544">'Hard up,' laughed Hartog to Preston, who was growling one day over tenants who had bad harvests, and must have twenty-five per cent, of their rents remitted—'hard up, are you? Oh, you've only to wait round a corner some night when Bootles is coming back to camp half screwed from that precious club down in Chertsey, and give him a rap on the head with that loaded stick you make such a display of sometimes, and then you'd have a cool thousand to go on with.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304545">'Not a bad idea,' returned Preston.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304546">Bootles looked up and surveyed the pair, his usual 'Ha, ha!' sending half a dozen fellows near into a roar of laughter</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304547">'Just try it on, my friend,' he remarked grimly to Preston. 'By Jove, how I would smack you!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304548">'Yes; I've no doubt you would. I shouldn't have a chance,' Preston returned. 'How if I were to get Tony there to bash you, and then go halves with him in the swag, eh? Tony, how would that work?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304549">'Might do, only I should be tempted to keep it all for myself. All the same, Bootles, I rather wonder you're not afraid to swagger about day and night, as you do, with the value of a thousand pounds on your fingers. It would be a jolly awkward thing for you if you <hi rend="italic">did</hi> get bashed in good earnest.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304550">Bootles looked down at his diamonds, twinkling and flashing under the lamplight.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304551">'Oh, pooh! I've worn them ever since I left Sandhurst; they've been all over everywhere with me. Besides, if anyone did cast eyes at them, his eyes might make acquaintance with them in a way he wouldn't altogether like. I once knocked a chap down—a low, coarse brute, who was just drunk enough to be cheeky; and, bedad, I left a dozen marks on his cheek that he'll never cast.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304552">'How was it? What did he say?' someone asked, suspecting a story in the background.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304553" n="418     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304554">'Why, I'll tell you how it was. I was staying with two aunts of mine, who live at Norwood, and one of my cousins—the one who married Clarke of the 140th—was staying there too. We went in by rail one night to the opera, and coming back by the last train there was a regular crush. Just at the last minute, our carriage being filled, the most howling snob you ever saw shoved in, and swore there was room enough for <hi rend="italic">him</hi>—plenty o' room; he'd "set" next the young lady (meaning my cousin). However, I happened to be in his way, and I set my legs across the carriage so that he shouldn't pass; and, as the train started before we had time to turn him out, he had to remain standing by the door. Finding his way to my cousin blocked, the brute began to smoke—of course simply to annoy us. I told him to put his cigar out—said I'd report him on arrival if he didn't. That set the snob's tongue loose directly; he caught at the word in a minute.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304555">'"Re—port me?" he sneered. "Is that all you dare do, you d——d lardy-da swell?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304556">'Having ladies with me, I was for the time fixed. A man near the door knocked the cigar out of his hand, and I held my tongue. Fool of a cad thought I was afraid of him, and continued his taunts in language I needn't repeat; made divers remarks about these very rings, and more than hinted they were what he called <hi rend="italic">flash</hi>. I never said a word; but at last, when we got to Norwood, and my ladies had gone to their carriage under convoy of their footman, I turned round to the snob, who had got out there too, and said quietly:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304557">'"You called me a d——d lardy-da swell just now?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304558">'"Yes, I did," he answered, "and I stick to it."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304559">'"Then, see how you like that," I answered, and just let fly straight out from the shoulder, and caught him on the cheekbone. By Jove! the brute went down like a sack of potatoes, and bled like a pig when they picked him up.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304560">'"I report this man for smoking in a first-class carriage," I said to the railway people who crowded up, "for using bad language, and I think it very probable you may find he has a third-class ticket. Here is my card if you want me;" but they never did,' Bootles wound up almost regretfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304562">'He would take care how he tackled a lardy-da swell <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304561" n="419     THE VANITY OF BOOTLES"/>again,' Preston laughed. 'I never could see the intense irony of that form of reproach myself, but cads always expect it to fetch us particularly easily.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304563">'It seemed to have fetched Bootles quite enough on that occasion, 'put in Laurie, with a laugh. 'Seriously, though, I've wondered ever so many times at your wearing those rings. Do you say they're worth a thousand pounds?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304564">'Thereabouts '—carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304565">'I don't think it right,' said Allardyce severely. 'The display of such things is sowing temptation on every side.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304566">Bootles laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304567">'Ah! I might sell 'em, and let it go to pay off the National Debt, eh, Ally? But as I'm not inclined to do that, I wear them always, because I think it would be a deuced sight greater temptation if I left them lying about my room in my servant's road. Besides, I always have worn them—some very queer kinds of places those rings have been in, too—and I think I always shall. I'm used to them; and, besides, who ever heard of such a thing as garrotting nowadays?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304568">'Oh, I don't know about that,' Laurie asserted. 'My old governor goes in for the perfect safety idea—not that he ever wears anything of any kind worth more than ten pounds—but he drives, and rides, and walks about the countryside by himself at all hours of the day and night, which, as he is a magistrate, and desperately keen after poachers, may yet be very awkward for him. He has been stopped three or four times—once by two fellows just out of gaol, who caught him at a dark corner and asked him what time it was. The moon shone out behind a cloud at that minute, and the Squire called out: "Oh, Joe Potter, Joe Potter, you big fool; do you want to get into gaol again? Go home to bed with you!"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304569">"It's Squire Laurie!" exclaimed one of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304570">'"Yes, it's Squire Laurie," my father answered. "I tried to keep you out of gaol last time, but I shan't be able to do anything for you if you go on in this way." But nothing is a Warning to the foolish old boy; he goes on his blissful way, protesting he knows every man, woman, and child within ten miles of his own house, as if that has anything to do with it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304572">'Oh, footpads have gone out of fashion!' Bootles laughed. 'If anyone were to stop me, depend upon it, it would prove <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304571" n="420     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>to be a poor devil starved out of house and home, knowing nothing at all about diamonds, and who'd be thankful for the half-crown one couldn't grudge him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304573">'Philanthropic way of looking at it,' said Miles, rather satirically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304574">'Well, I don't know. I met three poor chaps yesterday afternoon trailing down to the workhouse, footsore and hungry and jaded. Poor beggars! they looked as if they hadn't had a good square meal for a twelvemonth, and how the deuce they get in and out of the rags they call their clothes is a mystery. 'Pon my word, I could hardly eat my dinner for thinking of them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304575">Bootles did not think it necessary to add that one of them had stopped and begged a pipe of tobacco, if his honour happened to have his pouch about him. That he had drawn their three wretched histories from them—the usual histories of such sad ones—those who have been born of generation after generation of ill-fed, ill-housed, ill-clad men and women, with the result of being physically absolutely unable to bear the strain of severe manual labour, untaught, either as to any trade or as to the rudiments of education—pilgrims and strangers indeed, in a hard, hard world, where nobody wants them, and there seems no room for them even to die. And not happening to have his pouch about him, Bootles had turned his pockets out, and divided the few shillings they contained amongst the three. He did not think it necessary to add that—that was Bootles all over.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304576">'Oh, they're jolly well off in workhouses,' cried a young fellow who as yet had been silent. 'There's a lot of rot talked about workhouses, but I'm told their Christmas dinners are something magnificent. My sisters go every year to help to do something or other.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304577">Bootles looked at him with a glance of the most profound contempt.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304578">'Did you ever happen to see some stuff called skilly?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304579">'No—I can't say I ever did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304581">'Did your sisters ever tell you what it's made of? No! Then let me tell you that it's nothing but boiled oatmeal and water, with a flavouring of cockroaches and dirt of all kinds. Jolly well off indeed! I wonder if you'd call yourself jolly well off with a basin of that, and a hunch of coarse bread <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304580" n="421     THE VANITY OF BOOTLES"/>for your dinner, after being all day on the tramp, too! Yes, jolly well off indeed! Your sisters' two or three pet old men and women, whom they take their little packets of baccy and tea to, may be jolly well off, for paupers. But the poor devils of casuals—Heaven help 'em! for it's precious little men are willing to do for them!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304582">'Oh, pooh—nonsense! pooh—nonsense!' interrupted a testy old staff-officer, who had been listening to the latter part of the conversation. 'Mere sickly sentimentality! The gaols are full, the unions are full, the reformatories are full, the hospitals, the refuges, the homes, and all the other humbugging institutions are full to overflowing with scoundrels too lazy to work, who won't dig, and who to beg are certainly not ashamed. The entire country is overrun by these scoundrels, who have never done anything but tramp about from place to place, and from town to town, pretending to be seeking work, but in reality merely cadging about for anything they can lay their hands on. I would soon rid the country of such scum—a given time for them to clear out altogether, or ring 'em up—string 'em up! That's what I would do. But no, my tramp-gentleman may just do as he likes—by George, he may even marry and have swarms of juvenile tramps, all brought up to the same scoundrel's life as himself! Bless my soul, Ferrers! and you a soldier, a man of the world, have enough sickly sentimentality to pity such brutes as those!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304584">'You old fool!' said Bootles under his breath, which instantly sent Laurie off into a smothered fit of laughter; then aloud he said: 'Well, General, I look at it in this way: I was brought up in the country, and, as a lad, I saw a good deal of gipsy-life. We've all heard and read of the romance and the freedom of the life of the Zingari—it's all bosh and humbug; there is no more wretched, miserable, comfortless way of living on earth, except it be that of the tramp. The gipsy has his tribe, and his tent or caravan; the tramp, in nine cases out of ten, is not only homeless, but alone; a married tramp is a very rare thing to meet with. It's all very well for a fat old chap to get up and bawl:
<q><lg type="stanza"><l>'"Homeless, ragged, and tanned,</l><l>Under the changeful sky;</l><l>Who so free in the land?</l><l>Who so contented as I?"</l></lg></q>
He, most likely, has just eaten enough dinner for three men, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304583" n="422     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>and there's a pretty girl playing his accompaniment, with a view to impressing whom he throws an extra amount of expression into the last verse:</p><q><l>'"Once tender love watched at my side;</l><l>Now from above her angel's my guide."</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304586">That's one story. The tramp, shivering outside in the street, tells another, and the two don't bear much likeness to one another. It's all very well to call a poor devil who has never had a chance-no, nor his father nor his grandfather before him—a scoundrel who won't work, and who ought to be strung up. How is he to work? Who has ever taught him to work? What would you and I have been, if we had been brought up in a gutter, a quarter fed from the time we first came into the world—if we had had no fathers with money to shove us into the army and keep us afloat after we got into it? What would you have been now, General, if you had had a father who couldn't write his own name, and didn't know how old he was, nor where he was born, nor even what the number of the present year of grace happens to be, like that fellow Hutton Grath, who enlisted the other day—who couldn't teach you anything, because he didn't know anything himself? I know very well what I should have been—just a consummate scoundrel, ten times worse than nine-tenths of the poor beggars who fill the casual wards of a workhouse night by night—ten times worse. Half, nay, nine-tenths of them have never had a chance. Mark my words, that young fellow Grath will do well; he has never had a chance before, but to see him patiently polishing away at a button or a spur, because he's anxious to do his best—and, poor chap! never had a button or a spur to polish in all his life before—is a sight worth seeing. He has never had a chance till now, but, mark my words, he'll do well. You say they <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> work—I say half of them <hi rend="italic">can't</hi>; they are physically unfit for it; they don't inherit bodily strength enough to do it. I know it sounds awfully clever to say they <hi rend="italic">won't</hi> work, too lazy to live, and want stringing up; but in reality it's talking simple bosh. Is there a man in the world who would not rather live in a comfortable home of his own than in the casual ward? who would not rather have a meal of meat than of skilly? who would not rather have a whole coat on his back than go shivering in rags? Of course not; and people <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304585" n="423     THE VANITY OF BOOTLES"/>say and believe that the tramp goes without all these good things because he is afraid of hard work. I ask you, can you imagine any work in the world harder than going tramp, tramp, tramp, over miles and miles of hard road, with feet scarce shod, blistered in summer and frost-bitten in winter? No, by Jove! not you or anyone else can give me an illustration of work harder, more hopeless, more dispiriting, more wasting than that. When you can, I may think differently; but till then, if pity will do him any good, the poor devil of a casual possesses all the pity I have to give him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304587">The General was silent: perhaps he had nothing to say, for Bootles was a man of strong feelings and was kind of heart, and when he was led into talking, talked well and earnestly; perhaps the older man, who had been born and lived for the most part in India, was a little ashamed of the suggestion he had made for curing the woes of the unfortunate—I know not. Certainly, no one else took up that side of the subject; they all felt that Bootles had got the best of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304588">Well, it was but a few weeks after this, when the evenings were beginning to close in early, and the nights were dark and chill, that Bootles accepted an invitation to dine at a house just seven miles away from his quarters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304589">In a general way Bootles was in request for dinner-parties. He was very well off—that was known to everyone—his family was good, and he himself was not only amusing, but easy to please, and agreeable in many ways. Many and many an anxious hostess looked at him to help her out, if her party happened to be tedious; and he, being awfully good-natured, never needed a second pleading glance, but was wont boldly to throw himself into whatever breach confronted him, and patch it up as best he could by a story, or some new gossip that would do no harm to anybody.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304590">On this particular evening, Bootles ordered his dogcart to be ready at a quarter to seven; so, as soon as he heard the wheels grinding along the gravel under his window, he buttoned his ulster, caught up his gloves and went down the stairs, thinking, as he pulled the collar up about his ears, what a cold night it was for the time of year, and half wishing he had not accepted the invitation, quite wishing his destination was only one mile away, instead of seven.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304592">'What a deuced good opinion people must have of themselves, to ask a man to drive seven miles to eat his dinner!' he <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304591" n="424     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>thought; then, as he reached the steps, he said aloud: 'How's the mare, Terry?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304593">'I think she seems all right now, sir,' Terry answered; the mare in question had been out of condition for a week or more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304594">'That's good. What's the matter with your voice?'—glancing at him sharply through the gathering gloom.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304595">'I've got a bit o' cold, sir,' the man answered carelessly; in truth, he could only speak in a hoarse whisper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304596">'A bit of cold!' Bootles repeated. 'You ought to be in hospital. Why didn't Wainwright get ready to go with me instead of you?' Wainwright was the second groom, and but seldom wore livery.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304597">'Why, sir,' Terry answered apologetically, 'he's had the toothache for two or three days, and this afternoon it got so bad that the doctor pulled the tooth out. And he says—the doctor, sir—that he'd better stop indoors to-night, or he'll get the green summat or other in his mouth.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304598">'O Lord!' muttered Bootles half to himself, '<hi rend="italic">I</hi> never get any green anything in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> mouth'—at which Terry began to grin, for his master had teeth like those of a West Indian negro, and did not know what the feeling of toothache was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304599">'Well,' he said, getting into the cart and taking the reins, 'you'd better stop indoors, too, or you'll get a touch of green something on your lungs. One of the men at Highflight will attend to the horse. You'd better keep in with Wainwright, and if you're like that in the morning you must go into hospital. You can go up to my room, and ask Brown to give you that bottle of whisky in the cupboard—you and Wainwright can have it between you; and you're not to get drunk, mind—d'you hear?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304600">'Yes, sir—thank 'ee, sir,' replied the groom, touching his hat; then, as his master drove away, slapped his hand on his knee, with an exclamation which came from the very bottom of his heart, 'By Jove! but he is a good un!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304601">There was no doubt about that. At that very moment Bootles was driving quickly along, with a cutting north wind blowing in his teeth, thinking what a lucky thing it was he had asked that question about the mare.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304602">'This would have given that poor beggar his death!' he thought, pulling the rug up a little closer about him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304604">Fortunately the party was a pleasant one, and Bootles felt well rewarded for his cold drive—so pleasant, indeed, was it, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304603" n="425     THE VANITY OF BOOTLES"/>that he did not leave till long after eleven o'clock, his host then going out to the door to see him off.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304605">'Are you alone?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304606">'Yes,' Bootles answered with a laugh. 'One of my grooms has had a tooth pulled out this afternoon, and had orders to remain in, lest he get a green summat or other in his mouth; and the other couldn't speak for sore throat or something, so I came without one'—slipping a half-crown into the groom's hand as he spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304607">'Are you sure you don't mind going alone? It's a horrible lonely road through the wood, and the night's like ink.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304608">'Oh no—not I! I've the lamps to guide me as I go. Good-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304609">'Good-night,' was called back in return.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304610">Of a truth, the road was horribly lonely, and the night as black as pitch; not a star twinkled in the sky, and the moon was not to be seen; all above, around, before, and behind, was black, murky, impenetrable. Not that Bootles minded in the least. His horse was a good one, and safe, and knew his road home better than his master.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304611">Bootles never gave the road or the light a thought. He was thinking of something very different and very much more attractive—of a little witch, with dark eyes and ripe red lips, whom he had left behind him in the warm, well-lighted drawing-room at Highlight; a little witch with a voice like a siren, whose voice was still ringing in his ears—a song he had not heard for years and years:</p><q><lg><l>'"Tis the song, the sigh of the weary,</l><l>Hard times, hard times, come again no more;</l><l>Many days you have linger'd around my cabin door,</l><l>Oh! hard times, come again no more.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304612">He could get neither the song nor the singer out of his head. What a pretty girl she was, and how tenderly and sympathetically she had sung that simple and sad little song! He thought he should very much like to pit her against the old General, who had advocated 'stringing up' as a remedy for hard times. 'Old fool!' Bootles wound up contemptuously—then pulled the horse up sharp.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304613">'Hallo! what's the matter?' he called out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304614">The lamp on the off side cast a blaze of light on the ground, revealing the figure of a woman sitting on a heap of stones by roadside—a woman who was sobbing and moaning.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304615" n="426     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304616">'What's up?' Bootles asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304617">'I'm dead beat, yer honour,' she answered in a hoarse voice. 'I've been on the tramp all day, and I'm too late to get into Chertsey Union this night. I've had naught to eat but a crust o' bread a lady give me, and I don't know how far I am this minute from Chertsey—perhaps yer honour can tell me!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304618">'Oh, we're over four miles from the town,' Bootles answered. 'Woa—woa—keep quiet!' for the horse was impatient of being kept standing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304619">'I'll never do it,' said the woman desperately. ' I'm dead beat now, and my feet's bare to the ground. I scarce like to ask it, but if yer honour would be so kind as to give me a lift——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304620">'Oh, all right! (Woa, my lad—stand still, do!) Here, give me your box, and go round to the other side. Stand still, will you!'—to the horse, who was suddenly seized with a desire to use only one pair of his legs at once—not evincing much care which pair he chose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304621">The box—a common bandbox tied up with a bit of string—was handed up, and the women went lamely, very lamely, as Bootles noted pityingly, round to the other side of the cart. Getting in, however, was a work of difficulty, for the horse grew more and more restive with each minute.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304622">'Here, give me your hand,' said Bootles, pulling his left glove off that he might undo the button of the rug, 'and jump as soon as he stands.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304623">'Thank ye, sir,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304624">There was a moment's cessation of the horse's fretfulness. Bootles leant down and held out his hand, on which the big diamonds flashed brilliantly in the lamplight, and the woman took it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304625">The next instant an exclamation of surprise broke from his lips, and with all the strength he possessed he flung the woman backwards into the ditch, and with a cut of the whip sent the horse tearing on his way through the dark and lonely wood as fast as his four good legs could carry him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304626">'By heavens, what an escape!' he muttered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304628">Half a mile farther on he passed two more figures—men those—waiting by the roadside—men who came forward as if to seize the horse by either rein. But Bootles was ready for them. He sent his long whip flying out, and caught first one and then the other neatly across the face, eliciting the loudest <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304627" n="427     THE VANITY OF BOOTLES"/>howls and the deepest curses he ever remembered to have heard.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304629">Bootles uttered his grim ' Ha, ha!' of a laugh and dashed on—his blood was up.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304630">They covered the ground in no time, for the horse never lessened his pace, and Bootles never drew rein till he pulled up and shouted 'Gate!' at the entrance to the camp.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304631">Arrived at the mess, he told his story, winding up, 'By Jove! I'll never go to Highflight alone again. Those brutes meant doing for me. I wonder why; what the deuce have I ever done to them, I wonder?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304632">'They meant having your diamond rings, of course,' one of the officers said with a laugh. 'Perhaps you'll be warned now, Bootles, that it is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> wise to swagger about with the value of a thousand pounds on your fingers. And all for vanity, you conceited beggar!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304633">'Oh, it wasn't the two or three paltry rings!' contemptuously. 'They meant doing for me for some other reason, depend upon it. And oh, by-the-by, I came off with the bandbox in my hurry. Let us have it in, and see what its precious contents happen to be.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304634">The bandbox was brought in, and its precious contents proved to be a pair of six-barrelled revolvers, all loaded and ready for use; and besides those, a carving-knife with a blade just eight inches long.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304635">'That was intended to have made acquaintance with my ribs before this,' Bootles said, handling it with grim amusement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304636">'I wonder, having those revolvers,' said Laurie, 'they didn't pot you from the road.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304637">'Knife makes no noise; with shots there is always a fear of bringing keepers to the spot. No, a dig of that knife in my back, a groan, a tumble of a dead Weight into a ditch, and there they would have been safe for eight or ten hours, and no clue whatever,' replied Bootles gravely. 'However, thank God! my eyes, or rather my senses, were just opened in time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304638">'And what opened them, Bootles?' someone asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304639">'Why,' said Bootles simply, ' as soon as I touched it, I felt it was not a woman's, but a <hi rend="italic">man's hand</hi>.'</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304640" n="428     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_230" n="8" type="story"><head>A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT.</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_231" n="1" type="story"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304641">'I SAY, Bootles,' said Scott Laurie. It happened one afternoon that he had strolled into Algy Ferrers' room, and, settling himself in the easiest chair he could find—there were three to choose from—he puffed away at his pipe for ten minutes without speaking. Then suddenly he broke the silence with his usual form of address: 'I say, Bootles.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304642">'Ah!' returned Bootles, looking up from his work, which was a caricature he was drawing in pen and ink of Allardyce in the last stage of intoxication, making a speech at a temperance meeting, with the Colonel on the platform. 'What is it now?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304643">'Who's that chap up there?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304644">'Where? Oh, that's Kerr.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304645">'Kerr—the man who exchanged with me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304646">'Yes; there was only one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304647">'By Jove, what a handsome fellow!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304648">'Oh, I don't know that he was unusually handsome,' Bootles answered. 'Big, fine man, with handsome eyes and very white teeth;' then added after a pause, 'He altered a good deal after that was taken.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304649">'Did he? I had a letter from Gore the other day—he mentioned him. Kerr has taken my rooms in their bungalow, you know. Gore likes him immensely, but says he's desperately gloomy—the gloomiest chap he ever knew.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304650">'Ah! I shouldn't wonder.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304651">'Gore thinks he must have something on his mind,' Laurie continued.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304652">'Quite sure of it, poor beggar!' Bootles answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304653">'And he hates India.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304654">'Poor old Charlie!'—in tones of very real commiseration. 'Hates India, does he? Poor old Charlie! I'm sorry for him, for he'll have to stay there.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304655">'Why? Is he very poor?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304656">'Oh no; on the contrary, he's very much better off than I am.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304657">'Then'—opening his eyes to their very widest extent—'why the devil did he go?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304658" n="429     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304659">'Because he wanted to get away from England and everyone who knew him,' Bootles replied. 'Wanted to get away from himself most of all, and he evidently finds that difficult. I thought he would.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304660">'You and he were great friends, weren't you, Bootles?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304661">'Who told you so?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304662">'Preston.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304663">'What a long tongue that fellow has, to be sure—regular tell-pie. Yes, we were great chums one time—not of late. Not that we ever quarrelled or anything of that kind, but Kerr did something I disapproved of, and, somehow, we never got on afterwards. In fact, I never felt the same towards him, and I dare say I showed it plainly. At the same time I was very sorry for him, for I believe it simply ruined his life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304664">'Cards, I suppose?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304665">Oh, my dear chap, no!—nothing of that kind. Kerr was an out-and-out gentleman. Oh, Lord, no—nothing of a disreputable kind like that! I don't know if I ought to tell you. I certainly shouldn't have done; only, if I don't, you may go on thinking it something so very much worse, in the eyes of the world, that I had better. I'll just give you the outline: Kerr was engaged to a girl—a lady, mind you—when he met with her sister, a widow, whom he did not know as her sister at all. He fell in love with the widow and jilted the sister. Well, the shock killed her. Now, can't you understand how much such a thing came in between us? It utterly ruined Kerr's life, for not only had he the misery of the whole affair on his mind, but I believe he never realized how much he had cared for her until it was too late. When she was dead, he would have given half his life to have blotted out the past. Of course, he could do nothing but regret, and regret isn't worth a rush in such a case, except to make a man take better care for the future.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304666">'Then, he didn't really care for the widow?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304667">'Oh no—a mere passing infatuation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304668">'And the widow?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304669">'Was as innocent of blame as you or I. She was a splendidly handsome woman, under thirty, and of course couldn't help her personal attractions. On my soul, I never saw a woman cry so bitterly in my life as she did the day Mademoiselle Mignon died.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304670">'And she really died of it?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304671" n="430     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304672">'Oh, well, she lingered several months, each day growing weaker and weaker, and then at last she died. The doctors said she had no complaint; she didn't care to live any longer and so she died; that was about the long and the short of it. It was rather odd that she herself predicted it, poor little girl! when she had no thought of Kerr turning traitor, as he did. I was in town, on my way to Norway, and being, as I was then, Kerr's greatest friend, I went to see her, and as I had the afternoon to spare, I took her to the Academy. We were looking at a picture that suggested it; I really forget now what—a girl forsaken by her lover, or something of that kind. She looked at it for ever so long, and at last she said; "If anything were to come between Charlie and me, I should die." Poor little soul! it wasn't a month later that something did come, and, sure enough, it killed her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304673">'Was she pretty?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304674">'Very, and such a perfect little gentlewoman. By George! if she'd been engaged to me I'd have taken jolly good care that nothing or nobody ever came in between us—not even Venus herself. I asked her to run the risk of it, but she wouldn't.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304675">'He doesn't look the sort of fellow to do like that,' said Laurie, examining the photograph more closely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304676">'No more he was—in a general way. In that case, he lost his head completely; and when a man loses his head, depend upon it, it won't be very long before his wits go after it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304677">'No. By Jove, what a romantic story! And she regularly died for love,' Laurie was saying, when the door opened, and Preston entered, hearing and catching up the three last words.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304680">'Died for love—pooh! nonsense! fiddle-de-dee! Nobody ever did that in this world, any more than anyone ever died of the toothache. It always seems to me that there's a strong similarity between love and the toothache—take it from beginning to end. You have a tooth, say—perhaps it's a real beauty, white and well shaped; you're awfully proud of it, and take no end of care of it; you buy floriline and what not, by way of preserving it, and showing it off to the best advantage; you take every precaution that it may not get damaged, and carefully refrain from using it monkey-fashion, when the nut-crackers don't happen to be <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304678" n="431     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/>handy—in short, you study that tooth's comfort, and flatter yourself there isn't such another in the world. All well and good; but by-and-by it is not at all impossible that there comes a change; your tooth begins to pain you—pain docks you of your proper amount of sleep, spoils your dinner, and makes life itself a burden to you. And what's the consequence? Either you keep your tooth, because you haven't pluck enough to get rid of it, and you let it go on paining you, or perhaps you patch it up with a nervine or a narcotic. If you do that, what then? Why, after it has had its sop of attention, the pain stops for a bit; but just wait awhile, and see if it doesn't begin aching again-—aching devilish hard this time. And what's the effect? Your life is ruined—simply ruined; for after awhile it will affect all the other teeth, and there'll be the very deuce an' all to pay in consequence; your life ain't worth having, for you dare not meet a wind or get into a draught, lest you take cold; you dare not touch ice-pudding at dinner, or an iced peg when you come off a beastly inspection, feeling as if you'd swallowed all your peck of dirt at one gulp; you daren't eat sugar to your strawberries, and when the gal you're dead nuts on offers you a piece of nougat, you have to tell a lie, and say you don't like sweetmeats. That's the sort of life the toothache brings you to. But if you determine to be a man, to get rid of it altogether, what then? Why, you go to a dentist chap, and he puts a beastly forceps thing into your mouth, which makes you feel, for a moment, as if body and soul were parting company; and then you go away with a great hole in your jaw that aches for a bit more furiously than ever the tooth did. But afterwards, my friend, afterwards—why, to be sure, there's still a gap where the hole was, but <hi rend="italic">it don't ache</hi>. Love's very much the same kind of thing: the especial niche in your heart that was filled by some jade who wasn't worth a third part of the thought and care you expended over her may remain empty after you've cut yourself adrift from her, but you find consolation—if you've any sense, that is—in one of the other goddesses you happen to know—one that, as likely as not, hasn't a trace of falsity about her. Now, there was that chap there'—pointing to the photograph of Kerr—'the man who exchanged with you. I couldn't convince him, though, in a general way, he was as sensible <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304679" n="432     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>a fellow as you could wish to meet in a day's march. But he wouldn't hear reason on that subject. "Take my advice Charlie," I told him; "don't shilly-shally over it—<hi rend="italic">have it out."</hi> But poor old Charlie wouldn't listen to reason—said he couldn't, only wished he could, and all the rest of it, and ended by going off to India. The best chap gone wrong about a woman it was ever my lot to know. Fine fellow wasn't he, Bootles?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304681">'Very,' returned Bootles, without looking up from his work.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304682">'I think I never saw a fellow so utterly gone for love as he was,' Preston resumed. 'He was engaged to some girl down in the West Country, and then he got on with that widow. I never could make it out, and old Charlie never enlightened anyone on the subject. Either he jilted the girl, or the girl jilted him, or something—any way, Charlie was over head and ears in love with the widow, and I fancy she didn't see it. By George! how handsome she was—like a Greek goddess in flesh and blood. And one fine morning she vanished, and Charlie never looked the same after. Poor old chap! he wouldn't do as I advised him, and have it out; he'd have got over it by this time if he had.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304683">'I say, Preston,' put in Bootles mischievously, 'you must have had a good many of 'em out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304684">'I grant you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304685">'Got many gaps left?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304686">'I grant you—a whole row of vacant cells, of which I have locked the doors and lost the keys ages ago. If there are skeletons in them, I let 'em lie there in peace. I never disturb the bones of a past which I cannot alter, and don't particularly want to; I don't believe in routing out old bones; there's something positively indecent about it. No; you take my advice, Laurie; don't hesitate and shilly-shally over it—have it out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304687">'I?' cried Laurie; 'oh, I haven't one to come out!'—with a very heart-whole laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304688">'All the better for you; but bear my advice in mind, against a bad time coming. By-the-by, Bootles, I came in to ask you to lend me some stamps. I'm due at the Fords for lawn-tennis, and don't want to go into town.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304689">'Of course; they're in that silver box on the chimney-shelf—help yourself.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304690" n="433     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304691">'Oh, here they are; thanks, a thousand times. I'll take half a dozen—bring 'em back to-morrow; by-by.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304692">'What a duffer he is!' remarked Bootles, as Preston clattered noisily out; 'good-natured, and all that, but <hi rend="italic">will</hi> talk such rot, if he only gets a chance. There, now, I fancy that will fetch Allardyce considerably. We'll roll it up in his napkin at dinner to-night. Now, what are you going to do? Let's go down to the recreation-ground—the band's playing there this afternoon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304693">'Very well,' said Laurie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304694">He generally did say 'very well' to any proposal of Bootles'. Indeed, his was not a headstrong nature—perhaps the only time he had ever set up his will against Eliot Cardella's was in going to inquire after little Mrs. Hey's husband, when that individual was down with typhoid fever. So on this occasion he got up, looked at himself in the glass, perfumed his handkerchief out of one of the scent-bottles on the table, settled his blue cotton tie to a nicety he had not attained in his own room, and finally announced that he was ready.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304695">'Come along, then,' said Bootles impatiently, putting his wanghee under his arm whilst he buttoned his glove—'come along! What's the good of standing ogling at yourself any longer, you conceited beggar!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304696">'Yes—I know—I'm ready'—pulling himself together, and settling down into the army swing, which, since Bootles went at the same steady pace, took them over the two miles lying between the camp barracks and the recreation-ground in next to no time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304697">Now, the recreation-ground at Chertsey was just about the most generous thing of its kind you can possibly imagine—well-laid-out gardens, with a bandstand, and lots of chairs; a reading-room, tennis-courts, a good many trees and shrubs, and some very convenient out-of-the-way corners, much frequented by the younger members who happened to be in that blissful stage of spooniness when nothing but a sense of temporary isolation is needed to make them feel at peace with themselves, each other, and the whole world.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304699">Blessed period—the age of content! I call it so because, i' faith, oftentimes it is so very, very little that contents them. I like to see it, just as I like to see a married couple who are what the world calls 'making fools of themselves.' <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304698" n="434     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>I like to see people making that sort of fools of themselves, particularly when they are young and good to look at; there is something wholesome and refreshing about it—very wholesome and very refreshing. I don't think we old folks are half as lenient to the young ones as we might be—as we ought to be. We are too apt to forget the days—Heaven knows how many years ago!—so many that most of us would rather not talk about it—when we, too, were in the age of content; when we hadn't become dried-up old bachelors and sour old maids; or, still worse, hardened old married people, given to matrimonial jokes, very antique and threadbare, having a sort of faded outside show of pleasantry on the surface, worked, alas! too often on a canvas of bitterness, crossed by incompatibility of temper.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304700">I think, almost every day, what a pity it is that the age of content does not last for us all a little longer; that it, like so many other good things of this world, <hi rend="italic">goes off</hi>. Well, go off it certainly does, and the majority, even of those who have enjoyed it most themselves, are miserably intolerant of it in others; perhaps that is why the young ones are so fond of sneaking away into corners and shady arbours. Be that as it may, the recreation-ground at Chertsey was very well adapted for the furthering and spinning out of the age of content.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304701">'It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a jolly place!' Laurie exclaimed, as they crossed the centre lawn, where the rank and fashion of Chertsey were promenading to the strains of one of Waldteufel's most taking valses. As yet, he retained too keen a remembrance of weary India to take English beauties of green turf and unspoiled complexions quite as a matter of course.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304702">'Yes, not bad,' Bootles answered. 'Well, what is it?' for Laurie had all at once jogged his elbow with an energy which set his funny bone tingling, and made him feel as if he had galvanic battery at his fingers' ends.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304703">'I say, look at that girl.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304704">Booties did look.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304705">'Oh, pooh! she's not even good-looking.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304706">'Look at her feet,' Laurie remonstrated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304707">Bootles did look at the feet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304709">'Very neat,' he admitted—'very neat indeed. Puts 'em down well and picks 'em up very cleanly; all the same, you needn't put my elbow out of joint because a gal happens to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304708" n="435     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/>have a pair of neat feet.' Then, finding that Laurie made no reply, Bootles gave him a return jog with the elbow, entirely disregarding the galvanic-battery feeling: 'I say, Laurie, don't stare at her in that way, for Heaven's sake! she'll think you're a grabby out of F Lines.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304710">Laurie straightened himself up instantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304711">'I never saw such a divine pair of feet in my life,' he remarked plaintively. 'Let's sit down, and then I can look at them in comfort.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304712">That pair of feet finished him; to use a vulgar but expressive phrase, they completely 'settled his hash.' He went back to barracks and raved wildly about them for days to Bootles.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304713">'Of all the ladies in Chertsey, young or old, Bootles, that's the one I admire—more than admire, by Jove!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304714">I must say Bootles was fairly sympathetic, seeing that he did not much admire the lady.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304715">'Yes, fine, well-grown gal, with very neat feet,' he remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304716">Laurie was disgusted! The age of content does not call a spade a spade—its geese are all swans; young women are not young women—they are goddesses. Bootles called the divinity who had made such an impression upon him 'a fine well-grown gal, with neat feet,' for which Laurie, having fallen headlong into the elevating and beautifying age of content, could have found it in his heart to punch his head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304717">And yet, when you come to think of it, it was a very fail measure of praise; there are so many fine well-grown girls who have not neat feet, and those with neat feet are so often <hi rend="italic">not</hi> fine and well grown.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_232" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304718">IT was a very strange thing, but Scott Laurie, try as he would, couldn't for the life of him get to know the fine well-grown girl who had a pair of neat feet. He certainly did try, for some weeks, his very best. He saw her, almost without exception, every day—sometimes twice. By continually watching her, it was wonderful, though, how well he seemed to know her, and how thoroughly he believed he understood her moods.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304720">Her moods, by-the-by, appeared to him to vary a good <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304719" n="436     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>deal. Sometimes she was very gay and lively, and sometimes she looked decidedly down in the mouth, as he called it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304721">At such times he fancied the little feet moved with less alacrity, the whole air of her person and gait became subdued and quiet. Scott Laurie told himself he liked her best so. When he saw her, as it must be owned he frequently did, absolutely choking with laughter, he had a very shrewd idea that the gay laughter was <hi rend="italic">at</hi> somebody or other; more than once he saw an expression so mischievous flit across her face, that he felt his own lips relaxing into a smile out of sheer sympathy. Yet he had a horror himself of being made fun of, and while he cast the most adoring eyes at his 'lady,' as he always called her to Bootles, he entertained an unconquerably nervous dread lest, when he did contrive to make her acquaintance, she should find something to laugh at in him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304722">I much confess that Bootles was thoroughly sick to death of Laurie's 'lady'; but then, you see, he heard so very much of her, that it was small wonder that it should be so.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304723">'Oh, hang it all, Laurie, do drop the woman!' he cried one day, when Laurie had treated him to an extra dose, and his patience was quite exhausted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304724">'I <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> drop her,' returned poor Laurie plaintively. 'And I can't get to know her either, worse luck.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304725">'Then, why don't you go up to her boldly and tell her so?' Bootles suggested impatiently. 'Why, bless you, I'd have <hi rend="italic">eaten</hi> her by this time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304726">'Oh, how could I do that? A man can't treat a lady as if she were nothing but a little milliner-gal.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304727">'No, you wouldn't treat a little milliner-gal like a lady; it wouldn't do, eh? Well, then, why don't you write to her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304728">'When I don't even know her name?'—forlornly. 'Besides, what the devil should I say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304729">'Say? How on earth should I know? I always know what to say when I write a love-letter.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304730">'A love-letter!'—scornfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304731">Bootles laughed good-naturedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304732">'Oh, well, I thought you were really serious about it,' he said easily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304733">'Serious!' Laurie echoed. ' I should think I am serious—<hi rend="italic">ra</hi>—ther.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304734">'You really want to marry her?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304735" n="437     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304736">'I should think so!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304737">'The devil you do!'—in his surprise borrowing Laurie's own pet ejaculation. 'Regular over head and ears, and that sort of thing?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304738">'Utterly done for,' Laurie asserted, with mournful pride in the announcement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304739">'Oh, poor beggar! I thought it was half chaff. Well, I've been here longer than you have, and of course I know more people. I'll make inquiries about the young person.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304740">He was wonderfully good-natured, this Bootles. Not three hours later he happened to be standing at a shop door in Chertsey talking to a man he knew, when the object of Laurie's admiration passed by.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304741">'Oh, I say,' said Bootles, interrupting a remark about the command of a certain regiment, which, as a matter of course, had fallen on the wrong man, 'excuse me for interrupting you, but can you tell me who that young girl is?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304742">'The big one?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304743">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304744">'No. I—I—forget the name. Dear me, now, what is it? Miss—Miss—Miss—no, I'll be hanged if I remember it! She was engaged to some fellow here a few regiments back. His name was—was—no, be hanged to it! I forget his name, too. Or, stay, perhaps she wasn't engaged. I'll not swear to it, any way. Only, that the man was desperately in love with her I will vouch for. I saw it myself, and there is no mistaking that complaint when it's bad.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304745">'What was he like?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304746">'Oh, a fine chap enough. She's a fine girl, ain't she?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304747">'Ye—es; neat feet.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304748">'Very neat feet—very. And, by Jove! sir, you can tell nowadays what kind of feet and legs a woman has to walk upon. When those beastly hoops were in fashion, you had to take'em on trust a good deal.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304749">'Ah, well, you have to go on trust for a good many things,' Bootles returned with a laugh. 'But, as you say, these tight frocks do show off decent feet, and a decent figure, too. Now, there's a Miss Copeston here in town—know her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304750">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304752">'Gad! that girl is a shape, and no mistake about it. Waist that looks as if you might span it. I shouldn't mind trying With my arm; round as an apple it is. If you'll believe me, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304751" n="438     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>those two scraggy Sanders girls were chaffing her the other day about it. Told her they were sure it was pinched.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304753">'"Of course it's pinched," said she, as pat as possible. "I'm three-quarters of an hour every morning strapping it in, I have a machine on purpose, and my maid turns the handle till I can't stand it a minute longer; and when she stops, the buckle fastens with a snap."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304754">'And then, when she'd let'em pity her ever so long, she pulled a measuring-tape out of her mother's work-basket and offered to bet anything they liked that her waist measured more than theirs. If you'll believe me, hers was just over twenty-three inches, and neither of theirs came up to nineteen. Of course, one is as round as an apple, the others like a couple of deal boards put together, with a silk frock over'em.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304755">Major Lawson laughed heartily at the simile.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304756">'And there is something deucedly unsatisfactory about two deal boards put together, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304757">'I should think so,' echoed Bootles. 'Sort of thing that ought to be put down by Act of Parliament.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304758">Presently, when he went back to barracks, he strolled into Laurie's room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304759">'Oh, Scott, that little gal you've lost your wits over—'
he began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304760">'Yes. What about her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304761">'Why—er—nothing very much; only, you ain't the first.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304762">'Hey?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304763">'There's been somebody else; but Lawson of the Artillery, who told me, couldn't remember his name—nor hers either, for the matter of that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304764">'The devil!' cried Laurie; but whether the expletive was in consequence of Lawson's failure of memory, or the fact that the lady had had an admirer before himself, I cannot tell you, for I do not know.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304765">I think it must have been chiefly at the nature of the news, for during the few following days Bootles wished many and many a time that he had held his tongue; he was heartily sick of the whole concern.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304767">Laurie gave him no peace whatever. His continual and apparently unending stock of questions used to try Dickson's patience pretty considerably in the old Indian days. If Dickson could but have heard him plying Bootles, he would have said that his old comrade had got query-on-the-brain. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304766" n="439     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/>As Bootles himself said plaintively, 'It was awful—it was never-ending.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304768">Did he think she had cared anything about this fellow? Did Lawson say he was good-looking? Did he think she was engaged then? It was just possible the fellow might be on foreign service, in South Africa or elsewhere. Had Lawson said anything about it? Was the fellow—Laurie, by-the-by, pronounced it 'fellah'—in the cavalry, or only a liner? Did Lawson say he thought she had cared much about him then? Would he ask Lawson again if he remembered her name, who she was, where she lived, and if he was quite sure she wasn't engaged?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304769">'No, I won't,' Bootles answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304770">Eventually, however, simply to get rid of Laurie's tormenting questions and his never-ending rhapsodies, Bootles did make an effort, not only to discover the lady's name and where she lived, but to make her acquaintance—and after a time he succeeded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304771">'Scott Laurie,' he said coolly, going into that love-sick gentleman's quarters, where he found him singing, between the puffs at his pipe, a melancholy ditty—enough, as Bootles thought, to make one sick to listen to:</p><q><lg><l>'If in after-years</l><l>The tale that I am dead shall touch thy heart,</l><l>Bid not the pain depart,</l><l>But shed over my grave a few sad tears to me.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304772">Bootles groaned within himself, and promptly tipped the singer, chair and all, backwards, on to the old Persian carpet.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304773">'I'll tell you what it is, Scott Laurie, my friend,' he remarked, looking down with a laugh at Laurie's astonished face on the carpet—'I'll tell you what it is. That voice of yours is a mistake. By Jove! instead of being a soldier, one might think you were a Methody-parson practising for a love-feast.' He had the wildest ideas of the programme of such an entertainment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304774">Laurie gathered himself together into a tailor's heap in front of the fire, and looked up at Bootles, his elbows on his knees and his hands idly clasped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304775">'Do you happen to know what they do at a love-feast?' he asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304776">'Not I. How the deuce is it likely?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304777">'Well, first, they lock the doors.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304778" n="440     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304779">'Ah!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304780">'And then they put out the gas.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304781">'Oh!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304782">'And then they change places.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304783">'What for?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304784">'Oh, I don't know—to give a pleasing variety, perhaps. They've a regular shuffle in the dark, and you find yourself between a plump cook, fourteen stun and troubled with shortness of breath and peppermint lozenges, and a scraggy young person who professes herself frightened to death—"scared out of her wits" is the correct phrase—and insists upon holding your hand for protection—don't make any objection if you protect her a little further by putting your arm round her waist.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304785">Bootles looked at him with a disgusted air.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304786">'Scott, you don't mean to say <hi rend="italic">you</hi> ever sat between a fourteen-stun cook, all breath and peppermint lozenges, and put your arm—'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304787">'I?'—laughing—' no; but I've been told so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304788">'Oh, that's another thing. And what do they do then?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304789">'Then? Oh, they turn the devil out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304790">'Very proper, too,' said Bootles gravely; 'but how do they know him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304791">'Oh, they don't; but they scramble about on the floor and under the seats, and a general pandemonium is the result. Shouts of "Glory!" and "Hallelujah!" interspersed with cries of "I've got 'im!" "'E's kicking powerful strong," etc. And after that they tell their experiences; and then, when they go away, each of' em gets at the door a bun or a biscuit with three measly currants in it, and that serves them to prate largely for a week about grace and holiness, and all the rest of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304792">Bootles laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304793">'Well, apropos of turning the devil out—I've been to tea at the Lessingtons'.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304794">'Yes, I know. They asked me, and I said I was on duty. Why, there wasn't a devil there, surely?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304795">'I don't know. That gal you've been raving about the last few weeks was.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304796">Laurie fairly groaned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304797">'Just like my luck,' he cried dismally. 'And you were introduced to her, of course?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304798">'Oh, well—yes—of course,' Bootles admitted.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304799" n="441     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304800">'Well, go on'—impatiently. 'What's her name? What's she like? Charming, of course—that goes without saying. Did she say anything—at least, did you find out——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304801">'Did I say, "There's a great ass, called Scott Laurie, in my regiment, who's been more like a drivelling idiot than a sensible fellow for the last few weeks, because he's fallen over head and ears in love with you; but he has heard that someone else was once—if he is not now—in the same boat with him; and he wants to know what boat you were, or are, or will be in?" Did I say that? No, my friend, I did not.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304802">'Oh, Bootles, you are an ass!'—testily. 'What's her name?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304803">'Travers,' returned Bootles, seeking about for fusees or matches, and, finding none, sacrificing very cheerfully a voluminous and closely-written letter, beginning 'My dearest Algy,' a letter written in a feminine hand.'Travers. Mrs. Lessington called her Kitty, once or twice.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304804">'Ah!' Laurie leant back against a big chair, too entranced to ask another question. 'Kitty—Travers! Kitty!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304805">'Yes,' remarked the other, puffing at his pipe with a vigour that soon made the air cloudy. 'Ve-ry nice, homely, everyday sort of name—ve-ry.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304806">'Ugh!' growled Laurie in disgust.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304807">'Don't go very well with <hi rend="italic">yours</hi>, all the same,' Bootles persisted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304808">'It does—perfectly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304810">'Think so? Well, I don't. No! Kitty Laurie—Kit-tee—Laur-ee—why, old chap, it's as bad, every bit, as 'Enery 'Olmes or Polly Solly. By Jove! I once knew a girl called Polly Solly—a very pretty girl she was, too—as fine a girl as your Miss Travers; and she married such a brute, a self-sufficient little cock-robin in the line, with a long chin and two left legs. Always seemed to me,' Bootles continued plaintively, 'that there must be something radically wrong about a chap whose legs both walk the same way—must be. I must say now'—sending clouds of smoke up to the ceiling in a dreamy, reflective kind of way—'that for my part I do believe in the outward and visible sign—I really do; it stands to sense, by Jove! that a chap with a clean face must have a better mind than a chap with a dirty one. Now, the fellow that married Polly Solly, you never saw such a bumptious sixpenny-worth of copper in all your days, and those two legs used to go left-about-turn with a defiance that was maddening—to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304809" n="442     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>anyone with an eye for drawing, that's to say. They chaffed poor Polly tremendously about him when the news first came out; but Polly was only a simple sort of girl: she made one invariable answer—she used to say he was very pleasant in conversation. I believe she discovered afterwards that he could be quite the contrary. Lord! I never shall forget hearing them tell our old Colonel the news. Fitzroy had the regiment then. He used to say Polly was a very fine girl; and when some fellow imparted the news, he stared at him a minute and then he blurted out, "Good God! will she walk out with that devil?" Lord, how we all roared!'—going into fits of laughter at the remembrance of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304811">'But, Bootles'—breaking in ruthlessly on Bootles' reminiscences, 'tell me something else—is she thinking about that other fellow, do you think?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304812">'Not at all unlikely,' Bootles returned, deeming it not unwise to damp his comrade's ardour a little.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304813">'What does she talk like? Is she shy at all?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304814">'Shy—oh, by Jove, no! Tongue like a steam-clapper, and talks nineteen to the dozen; talks amusingly too, but makes fun of everything and everybody. Thinking of you, you know, Scott, I told her it was odd I hadn't met her before—having been quartered here so long.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304815">'Yes?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304816">'She said directly: "Oh, well, 'we go away a good deal; and when we are here, we don't go about much. I <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> going out."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304817">'Oh—h!' cried poor Laurie blankly. 'Well, and what then?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304818">'Why, you see'—half apologetically—'you see, thinking that you really do seem to be so desperately serious over the girl, and that I must make some progress for you whilst I had hold of her, so to speak, I told her that one of our officers had been wanting to know her for some time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304819">'Quite right. Well?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304820">'Well, and she began to laugh directly,' admitted Bootles, rather unwillingly. 'And, upon my word, I wished I hadn't said anything; but after a minute she said, "How nice of him!" Said I, "He'll be awfully disappointed he didn't come with me this afternoon;" and then she asked if you were good-looking.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304821">'Oh! and what did you say to that, Bootles?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304822" n="443     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304823">'Why, old man,' returned Bootles, with the utmost gravity, 'I wanted to do you a good turn, and so I stretched a point and said you were.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304824">Laurie got up and regarded himself steadily in the glass, at which Bootles burst into a great roar of laughter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304825">'There, now, you needn't go ogling that ugly phiz of yours in that way,' he cried. 'Miss Kitty Travers is not by any means such a beauty herself that she can afford to turn up her nose at you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304826">A fat pincushion—Heaven knows where he had got it; in a bazaar lottery, perhaps, for across its bloated red velvet surface was worked in white glass beads a device utterly unsuitable for the toilet-table of a cavalry-officer, '<hi rend="italic">Welcome, little stranger'</hi>—went flying across the room at Bootles' head; but, ducking, he dodged it, and betook himself off to dress for mess.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304827">As for Laurie, he sat down in a chair and repeated over and over again to himself what Miss Kitty Travers—<hi rend="italic">his lady</hi>—had said: 'How nice of him!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304828">Poor fellow, I doubt if he was ever so supremely happy and contented again—not for many a long day, certainly. In time he made his lady's acquaintance—he pronounced her quite as charming as he had expected to find her; also he announced to Bootles that she was the most perfect lady he had ever known.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304829">But somehow they didn't get any further. They didn't get on; or, rather, <hi rend="italic">he</hi> didn't get on. Taking things all round, it cannot be said that he was fortunate in any way; indeed, he was particularly unfortunate. He had a great many things in his favour, but, somehow, they seemed to be of no benefit to him. He was very handsome; in truth, more than handsome, for he was <hi rend="italic">good</hi>-looking—a nice, clean, fair skin, not much the worse for ten years of soldiering; nice white teeth, eyes that could and did look straight at you, and a smile that lighted up his face until it became simply radiant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304830">A fine, well-grown fellow, too; long of leg and straight of back—a man who could be seen in a crowd; as I heard a private's wife say about him only the other day, 'a man of distinguishment.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304832">Then, not only was he good-looking and good—and he was good <hi rend="italic">core-through</hi>, as the North-Country folk say—but he was also very comfortably off, and with the prospect of some day <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304831" n="444     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>being very well off indeed; for though Laurie never liked to think about it, still less to <hi rend="italic">build</hi> upon it, the grand old Squire who reigned over the old Queen Anne mansion, so snugly buried in cherry and apple orchards, could not, in the natural order of things, live for ever; and as he, since poor Willie's death at Isandula, was now the eldest of the young Lauries, he would some day come to rule in his father's stead. Nor was that all—the Laurie family was as old as any money-loaded parvenu without a grandfather to his share could desire, the Queen Anne mansion being <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> a new idea, and the supplanter of a manor-house dating so far back that I would rather not trust myself on the dangerous waters of details, but commend myself to the safer refuge of generalities.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304833">But whatever impression all these good qualities of person and position made upon Miss Kitty Travers, the truth may as well be owned at once, that they did not get on—they didn't exactly hit it off. Why they did not manage to do so I really cannot say—perhaps because Miss Kitty Travers was so much attracted by the handsome junior Captain of the Scarlet Lancers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304834">As I have said, Laurie was decidedly unlucky, and invariably, in his anxiety to say the right thing, managed to say just the wrong one. It was always so; the girl might, indeed, have been forgiven for thinking that often he went to great pains to try how disagreeable he could be to her. If he had cared nothing about her, he would have chattered away without considering what he was talking about. Then, again, if Miss Kitty Travers had cared nothing at all about him, she would not have cared in the least whether he said the right thing or the wrong. As it was, they always began by getting along like a house on fire, and then he said something, or she laughed in the wrong place, or, as often as not, she made a joke of which he couldn't see the point though his very life had depended upon it, though he generally had an idea that, in some roundabout way or other, she was poking fun at him; and so—why, they always ended by tacitly falling out worse than ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304836">And at last the Scarlet Lancers got their route. Laurie, infinitely the spoonier by reason of the many backslidings his wooings had had, made a last desperate effort, and, after getting on very well indeed for a day or two, unfortunately allowed himself to be drawn, led, piqued, stung into making <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304835" n="445     A JUST CAUSE AND IMPEDIMENT"/>a hit—mentioning no name, of course, yet uttered in a way no woman could possibly misunderstand—at that shadowy bugbear which stood always in the background, haunting him persistently, <hi rend="italic">the other fellow;</hi> and, naturally enough, it threw him back further than ever. So, having succeeded in getting nearer to an absolute quarrel with his lady than he had ever been as yet, he betook himself back to Chertsey Camp in a rage, and resolved that he would give the whole affair up, and have nothing more to do with her at all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304837">'Do as Preston advised you,' said Bootles, laughing, when he had aired all his grievances to him. '<hi rend="italic">Have it out</hi>.'
</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304838">'I think I will,' said Laurie wretchedly. 'Life's not worth having at this rate.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304839">'And you're really serious, old man?' asked Bootles, pitying his unhappiness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304840">Laurie nodded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304841">'Have you asked her outright?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304842">'I tell you I've never had a chance,' cried Laurie miserably—'never the ghost of a chance!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304843">'Then, take my advice—put it to the test. Ask her the question plump, and, take my word for it, she'll jump at you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304844">'Think so?'—eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304845">'I do. You've a clear fortnight. I'll bet you a fiver, when we meet at the end of the march, you'll ask for congratulations.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304846">'And you don't think the other fellow——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304847">'Oh, hang the other fellow!—cut him out. What if she did care for him once! You're the best man of the two, every way; make her care for you better,' Bootles cried impatiently. 'I bet you a fiver she jumps at you—positively jumps at you. There, I can't give you any more encouragement than that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304848">However, for once, Bootles was wrong. A few weeks later Laurie turned up at their new quarters, where Bootles had been settled some days, and, in reply to Bootles' questions, replied that it was no good. So far from jumping <hi rend="italic">at</hi> him, Miss Kitty Travers had very ruthlessly and relentlessly jumped on him, and Laurie was miserably forlorn, and more down on his luck than ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304849">'The fact was, she didn't care a brass farthing about me,' he wound up. 'And, by Jove! I must do her the justice to Say she let me see it plainly enough from the very beginning—never did anything but laugh at me and turn me into ridicule.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304850" n="446     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304851">I suppose the truth is, all the heart she had went to that other d——d fellow.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304852">Poor Laurie! Bootles thought it over, like a philosopher trying to solve the theory of perpetual motion, and the more he thought about it, the farther off did he seem from arriving at any satisfactory conclusion. So at last, other interests and thoughts forcing themselves into his mind, he gave up thinking about the matter, unless it happened that Laurie looked rather more melancholy, or was more restless and unsettled than usual.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304853">However, a few months later, while doing the Academy, he found himself face to face with Miss Kitty Travers, and although he said to himself, 'Hallo! here's that perfidious little jade who smashed poor Laurie,' he stopped and spoke to her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304854">To his surprise, she turned very red and then very white, seemed nervous and anxious in her manner, yet was very charming, and evidently desirous that he should stay and talk to her a little.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304855">Bootles did so, and, being very curious, and likewise endowed with plenty of cheek, purposely mentioned Laurie's name.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304856">'You knew Laurie very well, Miss Travers?' he remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304857">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304858">'Good fellow, is he not?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304859">'Oh, I should say very.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304860">'And so good-looking, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304861">'Handsomest man I ever saw,' returned Miss Travers promptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304862">'Yes; regular good fellow all round. I don't know a man I'd trust before him. Upon my word, I'd trust him with my very life,' Bootles wound up, getting quite energetic and dramatic in his friend's cause.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304863">'I, too,' murmured Miss Travers absently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304864">'Why, he was just raving mad about you,' Bootles blurted out. 'Why in the world didn't you take him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304865">Laughter never seemed to be very far away from that girl's lips. The absurd side of every subject occurred to her instantly, no matter of how serious a nature the subject might be. On that occasion the point of the joke presented itself to her at once; her eyes filled with laughter, and the grave curves of her mouth softened into smiles.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304866">'Why, you see,' she answered, '<hi rend="italic">he never asked me</hi>."</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304867" n="447     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_235" n="9" type="story"><head>OLD LOVES OR NEW?</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_236" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304868">'Is Captain Josselyn in his room, Fraser?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304869">'Yes, suit, he is,' was the reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304870">The tall young man in the frock-coat of an officer went one way, and the big dragoon, clad in gray garments that had the cat of a first-rate tailor, went the other, that way being towards the kitchen, which he shared with Trevor's servant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304871">'Tell you wot it is, Greene,' Fraser remarked, as he kicked the door to with a crash, and deposited a great pile of clothes on the table—'tell you wot it is, this 'ere' unting's the werry doose; wot with evening boots an' mawning boots, clothes an' 'unting things, I'm just wore out.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304872">'Yer should ha' gorne to the doctor's,' the other growled.

'Just this way the Capt'n is: all werry nice and civil as long as they keeps their distance, hut don't come a step nearer. "I sees where you are," he says, "an' if I wants you I'll come for yer." '</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304877">'Ah!' murmured Greene more reflectively than before. Trevor was wont to say of his servant that he was like the old lady's parrot—he'd very little to say, but was a devil to think.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304878">'Well now, the other day,' Fraser went on, warming to his subject, 'he was going to dine at Brodscombe, an' he says to me, "Fraser," he says, "don't you forget to go down to Mrs. Forrest's for my flower."</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304879" n="448     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304880">'So about five o'clock I went down to Mrs. Forrest's, and Mrs. Forrest she says to me, "I think as 'ow your master ain't so very friendly with Mr. Allondaile."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304881">'"Not so very," says I; "for why?"</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304882">'"Why," she says, "the last time the Capt'n wos in here, Mr. Allondaile comes in, and instead of singing out, as they mostly does, 'Hollo, old chap! I'll walk into town with you,' he just turns 'is back, and stands staring at them goody-bottles; and Mr. Allondaile he looks at him an' grins a bit to hisself, and then he buys one o' the yellow roses, and out he goes in double-quick time."'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304883">'Ah!' remarked Greene, dabbing away at the heel, 'just wot I said—cold shoulder.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304884">'Ay, but he's a good un, the Capt'n is,' Fraser repeated, then changed his tone: 'Now then, COME IN, can't yer. D'yer want to hammer the door in?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304885">In reply to this address courteous, the door was slowly pushed open, and a shabby, oldish little man, with an overdone bland manner, made his appearance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304886">'Air you Mr. Trevor's servant?' he asked civilly of Fraser, who was the nearest to him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304887">Fraser, without condescending to reply, jerked his thumb in Greene's direction, and went on brushing a pair of overalls so as to send as much mud-dust as possible over the visitor. Greene looked up from the boot which he was just placing carefully beside its fellow on the hearth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304888">'Is Mr. Trevor at 'ome?' the polite stranger asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304889">'No, Mr. Trevor ain't,' Greene returned, poking the fire with the toe of his boot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304890">'They told me just now in the guardroom that he were in barricks,' the shabby little man persisted, with conciliatory meekness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304891">'Well, I ain't responsible for no guardroom lies,' returned Greene, beginning operations on another boot; 'an' I tell yer he ain't.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304892">'But them's Mr. Trevor's clothes an' things ye're doing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304893">'And wot if they are?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304894">'Why, I should think they're pretty good evidence as 'ow he's at 'ome'—assuming a little more authority.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304896">'Oh, yer can <hi rend="italic">think</hi> anything <hi rend="italic">you</hi> please,' the dragoon said cheerfully. 'But all I can say <hi rend="italic">is</hi>, you must be a most orful ignorant party to suppose becos an orficer gets a twenty-one-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304895" n="449     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>days' leave, he takes every pair of boots and overalls he's got with him. Some gentlemen may, in course; but <hi rend="italic">my</hi> master ain't one o' that sort——An' if <hi rend="italic">you</hi>PLEASE'—suddenly growing lively—'just keep your greasy fingers orf that 'elmet; I don't clean 'elmets for the like o' you to smear over.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304897">'Oh, beg parding—very sorry, I'm sure, sir,' exclaimed the intruder, with a deference probably due to the dragoon's six feet of well-trained bone and muscle. 'I suppose, now, yer wouldn't let me go upstairs, and just squint into your master's room, just to satisfy my guv'nor that he really is away, yer know?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304898">'Oh, I don't know that I mind partic'lar'—with an air that would not ill have become a lord. 'I must finish this 'ere boot, though. I say, Fraser, are you going up? Then, just take the sword master borrered yesterday o' Capt'n Josselyn, with 'is compliments, an' he's werry much obliged.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304899">'All right. Just open that door for me, mister, will yer? Thank yer,' said Fraser, departing with a pile of carefully-brushed and folded clothes on one arm, while with the other hand he held gingerly—for it had just been cleaned—a sword. If the shabby little man could have drawn that sword from its scabbard, and examined the blade, he would have found, beneath a stag's head and the motto 'I shine,' a monogram composed of two letters, an A and a T, which, being interpreted, stood for Alan Trevor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304900">Having looked into Trevor's room and seen it was empty, Fraser went along the corridor and knocked at a door, then entered, and closed it carefully behind him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304901">'Hallo, Fraser!' exclaimed his master.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304902">With the impassiveness of a lump of lead, the dragoon propped the sword against the tall chest, which served its owner for clothes-chest and dressing-table alike, and began laying the pile of clothes therein.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304903">'Bum-bailiff, surr,' he explained, sitting back on his heels, and looking as stolid as if he had merely brought the orderbook, and had a headache into the bargain. 'Wawnts to see Mr. Trevor, and 'as promised to go away quiet if Greene'll let him see into Mr. Trevor's room.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304904">'What the deuce does he want there?' Trevor laughed from behind a cloud of smoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304905">'Satisfy his guv'nor, surr—so he says.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304906">'And what did Greene tell him?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304907" n="450     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304908">'Twenty-one days' leave, surr; there they go'—jerking his thumb towards the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304909">'By Jove! I must hear this,' Trevor cried, springing from his chair, in spite of a warning 'You'd better not' from Josselyn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304910">But Trevor, being one of those determined characters, hard to lead and absolutely impossible to drive, was not to be persuaded, and gently unfastened the door just as Greene's growling voice passed it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304911">'Just like you sneaking bum-bailiffs,' he grumbled, 'can't believe aught a chap tells yer. There now—do you see that room? Do you see as 'ow there ain't no one in it but ourselves? Now, didn't I tell yer; and mightn't yer 'a saved yer legs the trouble o' mounting them stairs?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304912">'But wot's the fire in for, if Mr. Trevor's gone away?' they heard the shabby little man ask suspiciously, whereat Trevor's gravity gave out, and he went off into such an agony of laughter that Fraser instinctively tried to pull him back again into Captain Josselyn's room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304913">Greene, hearing the laugh also, made haste to answer so as to cover it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304914">'Only went away a'ter lunch to-day,' he growled. 'Yer don't suppose we rakes the fire out the minute 'is back's turned, do you?' losing his matter-of-fact air all at once, and speaking in shrill, indignant tones.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304915">'Greene's losing his temper,' muttered Fraser. 'An' he's like Old Nick when he's roused.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304916">Then the strange voice broke in again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304917">'Well, you see, I didn't egzactly know,' it said humbly, so very humbly that the fire of Greene's anger was somewhat appeased. 'And where's 'e gone to—if I might ask the question?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304918">'Oh, yer might arsk till ye're black in the face,' returned the big dragoon with complacent contempt. 'An if I wanted to tell yer I couldn't. It's somewhere in Scotland—I forget the name;' then, suddenly perceiving an opening for a little romance, added, ' 'E's gone to see his young lady;' at which Trevor burst out laughing again immoderately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304919">'Oh, 'e's got a young lady, 'as 'e?' was the eager question of Greene's visitor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304921">'In course; most orficers 'ave,' returned Greene scornfully. 'Yes; he's 'ad a rare stroke o' luck,' he continued, with that <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304920" n="451     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>blissful disregard to the changes of grammar and aspirate common to the lowest stratum of society inside a barrack. 'A rare stroke o' luck—met with a young lady of title—a real beauty to look at, and fifty thousand pounds tied to her tail; they're going to be married next month—as soon as Mr. Trevor gets 'is long leave, that is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304922">'Hindeed!' Whether the bum-bailiff did or did not believe this statement I cannot of course say, but he expressed an opinion 'as 'ow there's some folks as won't be sorry.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304923">'I dessay not,' returned Greene, a fine air of indifference in his tones, quickly followed by a witheringly sarcastic imitation of the little man's greasy accents: 'An' now I 'ope as 'ow ye're satisfied, yer obstinate old beggar; and—oh, by gum, 'ere's the Colonel a coming! 'Ere, come in, an' let me shut the door; if he sees yer——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304924">'Stop a bit. I've a little job for 'im too,' cried the shabby one eagerly; and stepping forward with an alacrity which eluded the big dragoon's strong and would-be detaining grasp, he thrust a pink paper into the Colonel's hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304925">'Hey! What's this? Er—Greene—ugh!' as he perceived the nature of the thing, crumpling it up in his hand and turning upon Greene fiercely. 'Er—what's this man doing up here?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304926">'Mr. Trevor, sir,' returned Greene, saluting with a hand that shook in spite of himself, and feeling as ashamed and crushed as if he had shot a fox or otherwise disgraced himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304927">'Er—who's that? Fraser! Oh, well, turn this scoundrel out of barracks instantly!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304928">'But Mr. Trevor—I want Mr. Trevor,' the bum cried, evidently placing very little dependence on Greene's yams.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304929">'Not in barracks, sir'—in an agonized voice from Greene.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304930">'Turn him out—at once!' shouted the Colonel angrily; and, as a matter of course, in the hands of those two sturdy dragoons, the shabby little personage of the law had no choice but to go.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304931">Meantime, Colonel Wilson, foaming with rage, knocked at Josselyn's door and went in, the first object that caught his eye being the missing one, Alan Trevor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304932">'Oh, Colonel, I'm so sorry!' he cried, trying hard not to laugh. 'If Greene, poor chap! had only known, if he had only had the faintest idea of it, he would have managed to Keep him clear of you.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304933" n="452     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304934">The Colonel was, however, busily engaged in investigating into the nature of his pink-toned billet-doux.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304935">'Two pounds sixteen and sevenpence,' he exclaimed; 'expenses, thirteen shillings; total, three pounds nine and sevenpence; and, if you please, for a glove-bill, of which the first pair was bought in September, three months ago. I'll tell you what it is, gentlemen, the country is going to the devil!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304936">'Gone there, Colonel, long since,' asserted Trevor cheerfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304937">'Except the army,' put in Josselyn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304938">'You mean the White Dragoons?' cried Trevor, with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304939">'By Jove! you are right,' rejoined the Colonel, launching at once into his favourite grievance and forgetting his tick. 'By Jove! sir, these old women are bringing it to something. Half the officers in the service are more fit to be corresponding clerks in a Manchester cotton-warehouse than to command troops. Actually, they've given the command of the White Lancers—<hi rend="italic">the White Lancers—</hi>to Knowles of the 400th, passing over St. Vincent, who's been twenty years in the regiment, and is one of the best cavalry officers in the service. Gad! I expect they'll be making me Inspector-General of Canteens next!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304940">'Let us hope not, sir,' laughed Josselyn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304941">'Oh no, sir,' put in Trevor; 'the old women are not as bad as that. The worst they'll give you to inspect will be yeomanry.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304942">'Yeomanry!' repeated the Colonel in disgust—to him it was a very bad worst. 'And they'll dignify it with the name of "Auxiliary Cavalry." By-the-by, did that rascal want you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304943">'I believe he did. You sent him away, didn't you, Colonel? Don't trouble, pray, to send after him. I can manage to bear my disappointment, I think;' at which the chief departed laughing, his good-humour quite restored.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304944">Perhaps only a soldier can realize the smothered roar which burst out as the door closed behind him and the ring of his spurred heels died away in the distance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304945">'To think of old Five-per-Cent. getting let in for a writ,' Trevor shrieked, when he could speak. 'Greene, poor chap! very nearly spoilt himself. If the Colonel hadn't had that bit of paper for himself, he'd have sent him to look for me in double-quick time.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304946" n="453     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304947">'Which would have been rather a pity, after all his romancing about the lady of title, with fifty thousand pounds to her fortune,' answered the other amusedly. 'I'm afraid, Alan, my friend, you'll find such a <hi rend="italic">rara avis</hi> rather difficult to meet with.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304948">'Yes, by Jove! you're right, Josselyn,' returned Trevor promptly, and straightway he fell a-dreaming of a certain pair of lovely sapphire-blue eyes, proud as they were brilliant—of a regal crown of gold-coloured hair—of a dainty face, fair as a flower, and with plenty of soul and fire and pluck written on its regular features—as Greene in his rough way had put it, 'a real beauty to look at,' with a title; but alack! alas! without the fortune of fifty thousand pounds.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304949">Truly she was a beauty to look at—Greene was quite right in his hit there—this blue-eyed, golden-haired lady of title, the daughter of an Irish earl, so poor that he could not even keep his ancestral castle in repair, and had to live in one corner of a vast half-ruined barrack, large enough to have quartered a regiment of soldiers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304950">Trevor had met her a few months before, when on leave and staying in Ireland, and had fallen in love as desperately as if he had never been in love in the whole course of his seven-and-twenty years.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304951">On the last day of his stay at Ballyshannon he had gone over to Cuffe, and had told her that never, as long as he lived, should he forget her; no, not if he were to live for a thousand years. And then he had bent and kissed the soft little hand he would have given the world to have called his own. He had looked back at the old castle with something like a rush of tears to his keen eyes—eyes by no means given to that kind of thing—and then he strode away with a muttered curse at the poverty which had held him back from claiming the love of the only woman he had ever cared for; in that moment of grief he altogether forgot others whom he had left behind him under very similar circumstances. In the face of this newer, it seemed to him sweeter, love, other passions of the kind called tender had quite slipped his memory.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304953">And yet there had been many of them. With many a fair lady had he played `at bondsman and at queen,' happy for an hour, a day, a week, yet utterly and entirely careless of the great harvest of pain he sowed for others to reap; <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304952" n="454     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>heedless quite of a great and wise Book, which tells us, 'As ye sow, so shall ye also reap.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304954">There are many who forget it; I think most of us might plead guilty to the charge. As for Trevor of the White Dragoons, he had come nigh to the time when he should gather in his harvest.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_237" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304955">'THEN, you're off to-morrow, Josselyn,' Trevor said a few days later, when he went into his friend's room and found Fraser in a state of stolidly puzzled chaos.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304956">'Yes. You don't get your leave for a week, do you?' Josselyn answered. 'No, Fraser, no; don't put that hair-wash amongst the shirts. Stick it inside a boot, and put it in a corner. You get your leave next week, don't you, Alan?'—turning once more to Trevor.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304957">'Yes—Monday. Where do you spend yours, by-the-by? Town?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304958">'Probably part of it. I'm going to Cuffe for Christmas.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304959">'To Cuffe? I—I—didn't know you knew them, Josselyn.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304960">'I know Lord Cuffe and several of the sons very well. I don't know Lady Rosamonde,' Josselyn replied, in answer to the implied question in Trevor's remark.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304961">'You'll enjoy it. Cuffe is one of the most deliciously tumble-down, romantic old places in the world—a kind of Liberty Hall in carved oak and antique silver, with an ultra-aristocratic air of shabbiness over everything. I always think of that song Sergeant Farrar sings at the penny-readings:
<q><l>'"The tender grace of a day that is dead</l><l> Will never come back to me."</l></q>
All the restoration on earth would never give Cuffe quite the look it has now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304962">'And what about Lady Rosamonde?' Josselyn asked lazily, wondering that Trevor, the susceptible, had not launched into a vivid description of the sole daughter of the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304964">'Lady Rosamonde?' repeated Trevor stupidly, and with a deadly pain at his heart—a heart that had been faithful for eight whole months, and therefore had a right to a if it liked. 'Oh, Lady Rosamonde is charming! By-the-by, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304963" n="455     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>you'll remember me to her, won't you? Say everything civil for me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304965">Josselyn looked up curiously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304966">'Is she young?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304967">'Eighteen or nineteen.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304968">'Good-looking?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304969">'Extremely'—avoiding Josselyn's eyes, and looking out of the window.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304970">'I'll say all that's civil,' said Josselyn, suddenly understanding how it was he had not heard of this young Irish beauty before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304971">'Lord Cuffe did ask me for Christmas, too,' Trevor said presently. 'That is, in his happy-go-lucky, hearty way, he said: "You'll come to us when you get any leave, won't you?" I dare say he has forgotten all about it, and I don't know that I should go if he were to ask me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304972">'And where are you going?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304973">'Oh, I shall have to go home, of course. And I've three or four engagements already,' Trevor answered carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304974">So the subject was dropped, and on the following day Josselyn went off on his long leave, and journeyed straight as steam and rail could take him to the Liberty Hall in carved oak and antique silver, and saw for himself the ultra-aristocratic air of shabbiness which hung over everything—saw and admired, just as Trevor had done before him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304975">Yet most of all did he admire the daughter of the house, the Lady Rosamonde O'Shaughnassy, who came across the great hall to meet and welcome him—a slim, gracious figure, in a blue velvet frock, fastened from throat to hem by crystal buttons, cut in diamond fashion, which caught the light from fire and lamps, and made a twinkling rivulet of light adown her; a golden-haired, blue-eyed aristocrat, with dazzling teeth and a white skin, who made Josselyn, senior Captain of the White Dragoons, feel all at once as if, up to the present moment, life had not been worth the living.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304976">'You are very welcome to Cuffe,' she said, in a rich, low-toned voice, that had a touch of the brogue in it. 'You must be very tired.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304977">Two very commonplace, ordinary sentences, yet Josselyn was speechless—as speechless as men, who have not frittered away their hearts over endless flirtations, are when their hour and their fate have come upon them.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304978" n="456     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304979">'You must be very tired'—in the soft tones that thrilled him through and through. 'It is very good of you to come all this way from your pleasant gay quarters to a dull tumbledown old place like Cuffe.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304980">Josselyn's eyes wandered from the girl's beautiful expressive face round the old hall, with its carved oaken panels, its quaint china, its grim suits of armour, its old family portraits. He glanced at the great fire blazing on the open hearth, at the huge figure of his handsome host, and then his eyes returned, with an expression of content, to the girlish figure in the velvet gown.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304981">'I am very well satisfied with the exchange,' he told her, with that wonderful air of courtesy which regimental training brings to such perfection.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304982">Lady Rosamonde, whose pretty head was filled with hero-worship, set it down to companionship with Trevor, instead of giving Josselyn credit for any extra polish of manner that Trevor possessed, as she ought to have done.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304983">'If you were as weary of pleasant gay quarters as I am,' Josselyn went on, smiling, 'you would appreciate your leave as much as I do. I know that the term "pleasant gay quarters" <hi rend="italic">sounds</hi> most attractive, but the reality is a dreary barrack-square, a noisy mess-table, where you know every joke and story, and have heard them a thousand times—where you know exactly at what part of the entertainment to expect them. If that was your life, and you found yourself, as I do now, at Cuffe—why, you would feel as if you had got out of purgatory into paradise.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304984">Lady Rosamonde smiled, admitting to herself that not even Alan Trevor could say a graceful thing so gracefully as this. And then she gave a fond little sigh to the memory of that Peri—otherwise Alan Trevor—languishing outside the gate of paradise, in the uncongenial noise and racket of the mess-table and the stale jokes—that mode of life his brother officer styled purgatory. If she could have seen him at that moment, seated jockey-fashion on a chair in his room, recounting to Bill Brookes, his best friend after Josselyn, what a ripping fine gal he had seen in St. Thomas's Street half an hour before!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304986">'Eyes like saucers, and as black as my boots, Bill, I give you my word of honour,' he was saying, holding a big meerschaum at arm's length, and sending a rapturous cloud <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304985" n="457     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>of smoke up into the air. 'As black as my boots, and a shape like the Venus of Milo, by Jove! Plenty of size, and no mistake about it. Gad! she was a stepper!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304987">'Never admired the Venus of Milo myself,' returned Bill Brookes sleepily. 'Such a deuce of a foot, and such a thundering thick waist—why, a man's arm wouldn't go round it!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304988">'Ah, well, I like a good armful myself,' Trevor asserted. 'Never did admire your little slender women. And this one hadn't a thick waist; on the contrary, I believe I could have spanned it'—putting his two large hands together, and making a girdle of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304989">'Then, she must have been pinched,' returned Bill, with decision. 'Pinched-in women always make me feel uncomfortable—make me think of all the internal business jammed together higgledy-piggledy, don't you know. Now, whenever <hi rend="italic">I</hi> get married I shall take devilish good care to choose a woman who won't bore me with the consequences of pinching—indigestion, dyspepsia, "feeling low," being "out of sorts," and all the rest of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304990">'Lord! what a 0fool you are, Bill!' Trevor laughed, knocking his pipe out against his heel. 'What do you know about it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304992">'Oh, I know a good lot about it,' the other said seriously. 'And I'll tell you how I know. When Riversleigh, my brother, came in for the title, he thought he ought to get married, so he looked about. We Brookes always were deliberate business-like sort of people, and his looking about took him a couple of seasons. Still, he didn't seem to see anything to suit, and we all began to think he didn't mean taking the plunge. However, one fine morning he announced to the Marchioness that he had made up his mind, and the young lady was trotted down to Riversdale to be inspected. My lady pronounced her perfection, and all the rest of us followed suit. I happened to be on leave at the time. She really was as pretty a little woman as I'd seen for a long time—gilt-coloured hair, and a very nicely got-up little face. Her great claim to good looks, however, lay in her figure—and it was a pretty little figure, too—short, very plump, like a pouter pigeon in good condition; and a waist—by Jove! it wasn't any thicker than her throat. Span it? I give you my word of honour, Riversleigh could not only span it, but <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304991" n="458     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>had three inches to spare. I used to wonder how the devil it was she didn't snap in two, only, as she didn't, I came to the conclusion it must be natural to her. I stayed at Riversdale nearly three weeks with her, and the more I wondered the more I watched her, and the more I watched her the more I wondered. Poor old Riversleigh had always been a bit gone about rowing, and at that period his craze came in very nicely, for they used to go spooning down the river in a comfortable old tub that nothing would upset. They were on the river all day long—morning, noon, and night, and used to talk rapturously about the yacht that was fitting out for their honeymoon cruise. Miss D'Arcy declared she gloried in water, whether salt or fresh, but it's my belief it was for nothing else than that it gave her no exertion. Well, one day, after a lot of persuading, I got her to go out on horseback, and very pretty she looked in her habit, I must say. Riversleigh was obliged to give her a kiss when she came downstairs, and told her she ought to ride every day, she looked so well. Of course, that was all right. She flushed up, and smiled, and all the rest of it—said she thought she must ride more; explained to me that she hadn't ridden much, she'd always been so delicate. Then Riversleigh put her up, and off we went. Well, we hadn't gone above half a mile before she pulled up, with a pain in her side; thought she would get off and walk home, and very nearly turned hysterical over it; looked reproachfully at me, and said I'd nearly shaken her to bits—that was because I had suggested a canter on the grass at the side of the road. Eventually, Riversleigh took her home at the slowest crawl imaginable, and Nell—my sister, who married Lucy, of the 7th—and I went on together.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304993">'"She seems very delicate," Nell said to me, when we'd watched them out of sight. "She can't walk a mile without being utterly exhausted, and here she is on horseback just knocked up in the same way. I can't make it out, Bill," she said; "she <hi rend="italic">looks</hi> all right in the house."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304994">'"She can put a good square meal out of sight," I answered, "for I've watched her in amazement, considering the sixteen- inch waist Riversleigh's so proud of."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304996">'Nell said she thought it was the waist and the heels combined, and declared that, though she was only a couple of inches taller than Miss D'Arcy, she was seven and a half <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1304995" n="459     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>inches more round the girth. And said I to Nell, "Keep it there, my dear—keep it there." We had a very jolly ride, and two hours later, when we got back to Riversdale, we found Ethel on the sofa, and Riversleigh fanning her, and, oh! all the rest of the humbug—tea, smelling-salts, and a general air of exhaustion. That was the regular thing all the three weeks I was at home, and a few months later they got married. Well, they've been married five or six years, so I suppose she's about thirty; but, if you'll believe me, though Lady Riversleigh has gained a couple of stones in weight, she prides herself yet on having a waist under twenty inches. She never walks a yard if she can possibly help it; she never goes upstairs if she can possibly get anyone else to go for her. I wonder they don't have a lift, or a Carter's carrying-chair, for she says it gives her palpitations. Of course, she has never been on a horse since she was married; and Riversleigh, poor devil! has given up hunting, and everything else, because my lady's nerves won't bear the agitation her affection puts her in, when he is likely to get into any danger. So Riversleigh is tied to his wife's apron-strings all day long, a kind of head-nurse; and as she has a headache, or feels a little low, about every other day, he has a nice time of it, poor devil! I know I wouldn't stand in his shoes for something.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304997">'Then I suppose he is fond of her yet,' Trevor said, filling the meerschaum again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304998">'O Lord, yes—sickeningly so; though she has lost all her beauty except her waist. Lately she has got to look blotched and coarse, though she <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to look little more than a girl. I asked our old doctor, the last time I was at home, what had made my lady lose her complexion. Of course, as I expected, the tight waist was to blame. "If Lady Riversleigh would take plenty of exercise, and let her waist out, she'd be the prettiest woman in England," the old chap said. I'll tell you what it is, Trevor; for a woman, tight-lacing's the devil.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1304999">'I tell you this woman was a regular clipper,' Trevor asserted valiantly; 'and I don't believe she was pinched a bit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305000">He didn't admire little slender women. He liked plenty of size, with eyes like saucers, and as black as your boots. If Lady Rosamonde could only have heard him! But she could not, and so that tender little sigh for him, in the very novel character of a Peri at the gate of paradise, escaped her lips.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305002">Trevor had caught her fancy! He had come into her un-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305001" n="460     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>eventful life like some brilliant meteor, and had left behind him the memory of his handsome, bronzed young face, his winning manner, his silver tongue. Never had any young lady two more different strings to her bow than had Lady Rosamonde in Josselyn and Trevor. Josselyn would win her, if he could, by every means that lay in the power of his cool, firm, practical mind; Trevor—I am a little ashamed of Trevor already—Trevor, having frittered away his heart in little bits, at the beck and call of every pretty pair of eyes that had glanced at him, every soft-toned voice that had chained his fancy for a moment, would only value her really as long as there was somebody else who would value her more; and Lady Rosamonde, not having had sufficient experience to enable her to tell t'other from which, let her fancy fix itself on Trevor, little dreaming that Trevor's fancy had gone wandering after a pair of big, bold, black eyes, and a waist, as Lord William Brookes expressed it, with all the internal business jammed together higgledy-piggledy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305003">There is a poet who puts it less prosaically:
<q><l>'Birds quick to fledge, and fly at call,</l><l>Are quick to fall.'</l></q></p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_238" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305004">A BARRACK-ROOM; that is to say, a room in the block of buildings known in Carminster Barracks as the officers quarters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305005">Not a very inviting apartment; for the two little windows—that would neither of them open wide enough for a man to put his head out comfortably—looked over a yard, and had an extensive view of kitchens and soldier servants in every variety of undress—not exactly military undress.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305007">The room was not more than fourteen feet square, and boasted of the usual articles of barrack-room furniture—the usual barrack-room fixture-fender, openly and honestly innocent of varnish and blacklead alike. It caught your eye the moment you entered the place, and proclaimed that there was no deception about it. It was not like the hideous regulation-chairs, that had been clad in cretonne petticoats to hide their native ugliness; nor yet like the tall chest opposite, which, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305006" n="461     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>clad in the same garb, had to serve a threefold purpose—first, when on the march, as a case for the chest of drawers on the other side of the room; secondly, when settled down, as a wardrobe as to its interior; and, thirdly, as a dressing-table as to its exterior. No; there was no sham about the fender. On the floor was a worn Turkey carpet, and drawn up to the fire were two large chairs. Propped against one of these was a sword, while on the seat lay a forage-cap and a much-worn belt. The other chair was occupied by a sharp blue-and-tan Yorkshire terrier of the smallest bodily proportions—under five pounds, her owner declared—but of brain and heart-power the largest the world had ever known.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305008">Just as the little travelling-clock on the mantelshelf struck four, Coddles set up a sharp bark; then subsided into silence, accompanied by much shivering and shaking of her little, silky person.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305009">'What's up, Coddles?' murmured a sleepy voice from the cot in the corner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305010">Coddles answered by another bark.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305011">'It's only Greene,' Trevor told her; and, sure enough, a minute later Greene entered the room, carrying two letters in one hand, and in the other the pair of newly-varnished boots which is the almost normal accompaniment of a soldier servant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305012">'Quiet, Coddles, quiet!' cried Trevor to the dog, who, assured of Greene's identity, was dancing about his feet, in imminent danger of getting her little toes crushed under his heavy boots. 'What is it, Greene?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305013">'Letters, sir,' was Greene's laconic reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305014">'Ticks, I suppose,' muttered Trevor to himself, or maybe to Coddles, who on hearing him speak had ceased her attentions to Greene, and had established herself on her master's breast, where she sat bolt upright, quivering all over, and with a desperately keen eye to the stamps on the two envelopes, which she looked upon as her especial right.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305015">'Oh, by Jove!' exclaimed Trevor energetically, half raising himself from the cot and toppling Coddles over on to the floor. 'Hallo, Coddles! tumbled overboard? Hurt, old woman? there, never mind! Jump up again.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305017">How that letter had made him jump! I ought to have put a dozen notes of admiration, properly to express the magnitude of the start which had made such complete shipwreck of the blue-and-tan Yorkshire terrier. There was nothing very <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305016" n="462     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>wonderful about it—a plain square envelope bearing the address:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305018">'<name>LIEUTENANT ALAN TREVOR</name>,
<address><addrLine>l6th Dragoons,</addrLine><addrLine>Carminster,</addrLine><addrLine>England,</addrLine></address>'</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305019">and on the reverse a coronet. There was nothing very wonderful about it, nor about the writing, which was a big, firm, round, man's hand—the hand of a man more fond of his gun than his pen.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305020">Trevor, however, tore open the cover with a sigh so profound that Coddles, fearing another shipwreck of her small person, clung to him with all her might, and gave another indignant bark by way of remonstrance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305021">'I can't go, of course,' he said aloud, when he had mastered the contents of the letter, then flung it down impatiently. 'Oh, Coddles, Coddles, my friend, I wish I were like you, and had neither a memory nor a conscience; how jolly it would be! Not that I have much of either, and yet——' He covered his eyes with his hand at that point, and fairly groaned, trying to shut out the vision of gold locks and sweetly-smiling sapphire-blue eyes—a vain endeavour.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305022">'Poor darling little Rosy! if only you had been less daintily beautiful, or I more blind!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305023">It was no use trying to console himself with stale reflections concerning the inconstancy of the feminine character. He very well knew, though the letter bore the signature of 'Cuffe,' it had in reality emanated from Lord Cuffe's daughter. He had scarcely sufficient self-esteem—and that particular bump in his phrenological chart was pretty largely developed—to imagine that Lord Cuffe, left to himself, would have so much as remembered his existence, far less would he have asked him to his house. No, it was poor, dear, darling, bright, tender Rosy, who, more faithful than himself had lived all these eight months upon the carefully-worded assurances he had made at the expiration of his visit to Ballyshannon. Eight whole months; he had not expected it of her, though he had actually been faithful himself for exactly that period. But now the first week of the ninth month had passed, and Rosy was faithful yet, while he—oh well, the blue eyes faded away, and a pair of big bold black ones took their place and ended the sentence for him.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305024" n="463     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305025">He could not possibly go. He dismissed both the blue and the black eyes from his memory, and reminded himself that he could not possibly go. Firstly, because he had already accepted as many invitations as his leave would allow; secondly, because Cuffe was a great distance off and altogether out of the way of his other engagements; thirdly—most important reason of all—because he could not afford to ask Lady Rosamonde to marry him. His whole income of seven hundred a year, even if it were perfectly clear, would be but a miserable pittance to ask the daughter of an Earl to share. It is true that his somewhat weakly conscience reminded him that Lady Rosamonde had never been accustomed to any greater style than he would be able to give her when his father died, and he, as eldest son, came to reign at Barmby. But then, as he reminded himself and his conscience, with the alacrity which is generally due in such cases to inclination and duty going the same road, his father was only fifty years old, and the Trevors were a long-lived race. He might, and probably would, live to be ninety. Alan wished it might be so from the very bottom of his heart, and though on seven hundred a year a married officer can live very respectably, yet his income was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> clear; on the original small estate of seven hundred a year, which had been left to him by his godmother, there were more debts and mortgages than he liked to think about. And besides those, there were more post-obits and life assurances connected with his heirship of the Barmby property than Mr. Alan Trevor cared to give his mind to at that precise moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305027">And besides that, he argued, if seven hundred a year had not sufficed for him as a subaltern and a bachelor, how the deuce would it be possible for him to keep a wife on that sum? That it ought to have sufficed, Trevor knew well enough—none better, indeed. Seven hundred a year is a good income for a sub in a cavalry regiment, but he, like a young fool, had gone in for tandems and extra hunters, with a fast-trotting cob to save his legs when on duty as orderly-officer, or when going into Carminster. For a while he had vied very successfully with a brother officer whose income was some five thousand a year, though his expenditure <hi rend="italic">never</hi> exceeded two. Then, after a time, the tandem and the extra hunters had been put down, and his stud reduced to a couple of chargers, a hunter, and the fast-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305026" n="464     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>trotting-cob before-mentioned. The cob he couldn't part with; he was wont to declare he would sooner give up his third gee than Jerry; Jerry was so useful a member of society, as society went in the White Dragoons. He had been taught innumerable tricks, of which one was to kick in the panels of any door Trevor ordered him. It was on record that once Jerry, having grown tired of waiting for his headlong young master, who had left him at the entrance of the officers' quarters, had made his way upstairs, and had, <hi rend="italic">sans cérémonie</hi>, kicked in the door of the Adjutant's sitting-room, where Trevor was making a call on that gentleman's pretty little wife.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305028">But though he had put down his establishment, his foolish freaks had left behind him a goodly crop of debts which he had at present no means of paying off, nor had he any inclination to further lessen his expenditure.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305029">' It's quite impossible to go now,' he mused; 'and even if I had no engagements, it would, under the circumstances, be worse than madness to entertain the idea for an instant—infinitely worse than madness. I should be safe to fall over head and ears in love with her again, and heaven only knows what that might lead to; besides, I've promised to go to the Gales'. Hallo!'—as a bugle-call rang out. 'Stables; I'd no idea it was so late. Come, Coddles.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305030">He slipped his belt over his head, caught up his cap, and, buckling on his sword, went out with a good deal of jingle and swagger. As he passed the dressing-glass on the tall toilette-table, he caught sight of his blue clouded eyes, and gave a last sigh to the memory of those other eyes that were ever so much bluer than his own, the eyes that would fill with such an agony of disappointment when his reply should go back to Cuffe.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305031">'Poor little woman!' he muttered; and, indeed, at that moment the jingle and the swagger covered a very sore heart, as jingle and swagger so often do. Then he roused himself with a shake. 'Oh, dash it all! I don't suppose she'll care a fig. Ten to one she's forgotten all about me by this time—<hi rend="italic">ages</hi>since, only Josselyn's being there put old Cuffe in mind of his invitation. Likely enough, Rosy had nothing to do with it. Most probably she is fully occupied at this moment making all the eyes she's got at Josselyn, just as she used to do at me last spring; those Irish girls are born coquettes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305033">So, having come to a conclusion which was good enough to <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305032" n="465     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>satisfy what he was pleased to call his conscience, he banged his door to with a good deal of unnecessary force, and, closely followed by Coddles, clattered along the corridor and down the stone steps into the square, singing softly to himself as he went:</p><q><lg><l>'Last nicht there were four Maries,</l><l>This nicht there'll be but three;</l><l>There was Mary Seaton an' Mary Beaton,</l><l>An' Mary Canmchael an' me.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305034">It was no use thinking about Rosy. He hadn't any money, and she hadn't any money, so he could not have her, and that was the long and the short of it. But was that any reason why he should think of no one else? Alas for the Lady Rosamonde, with the blue, proud eyes and the gold beauty of her hair! She had passed already into the things that are no more; for him she had become one of the things that have been.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305035">By the time the orderly-officer and Coddles had reached the first block of stables and soldiers' quarters, the blue eyes had given entire place to the black ones; the faint, very faint, touch of compunction had left off stinging, the happy, careless light had found its way back to his blue eyes, the good-humoured smile had returned to his lips. Then the black eyes, in their turn, gave place to a newer interest in the person of Lord William, in much-besplashed pink, who turned in at the gates at that moment, and rode slowly down the square towards the mess.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305036">'Hallo, Bill!' cried Trevor, as he neared him, 'you've had a Stiff run to-day?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305037">'Yes. The old mare's squeezed dry, poor old thing!' Bill replied. 'I shan't take her out for a fortnight.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305038">'Good meet?' Trevor asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305039">'Yes—very fair. The people from Wroxhill were out, and that Miss Gale who's staying there asked after you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305040">'Ah! Did she look well?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305041">'Humph—no—I can't say she did. She don't show to advantage on horseback—those heavy women never do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305043">'Don't care much for horsey women myself,'Trevor remarked, adjusting the hang of his sword, and utterly ignoring the fact that Bill Brookes had listened by the hour together to his rhapsodies concerning Lady Rosamonde's equestrian perform-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305042" n="466     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>ances. 'I don't think the saddle's quite the place for a lady—never did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305044">'Ah, well, I like a woman who rides straight myself,' Bill returned. 'Always have a better nerve, and don't go in so largely for headaches and other fads of that kind. Not that I should look twice at Miss Gale, however well she rode. I like a face with more beauty and less brass in it. Well, come up, old girl—don't tread on Coddles, you duffer!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305045">But Trevor called after him: 'Bill, are you going to your rooms?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305046">'Yes, but only to change. I've got to look up Crow, who's in hospital with a sprained ankle—slipped into one of those beastly open drains last night, poor chap! and then I promised Josselyn to see to the gray mare.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305047">'Josselyn's gray—why, what's amiss with her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305048">'Oh, his fool of a groom let her down the other day—the day you were over at Crowsfield—and broke both her knees badly. I was here in the square with Josselyn when the gray came limping home—the man with his face all bleeding. Josselyn just took the bridle out of his hand, and said quietly, "Go over to the hospital and get your face seen to—I'll look to the mare." I'd expected a devil of a shindy, and so had the groom. They said afterwards the great fool went over to the hospital blubbering.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305049">'And Josselyn never said a word?' Trevor exclaimed. 'That was just like Josselyn.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305050">He was right; it was like Josselyn—<hi rend="italic">very!</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305051">Having watched Bill Brookes and his wearied mare down to the mess, Trevor turned to find himself face to face with the daughter of the Quartermaster, who was evidently returning from the town.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305052">'Good-afternoon, Miss Polly. How d'ye do?'—touching his cap with as easy an air of familiarity as if she had been one of the officers. 'Cold, ain't it? Got a book there? What is it? "For Honour." Rather high-sounding. Is it good?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305053">'Oh, awfully good, Mr. Trevor! All barrack-life; and the mistakes are splendid!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305055">'Barrack-life! I'll read it. I'll send Greene down for at once. Now then, what the devil—I really beg your pardon, Miss Polly'—breaking off his not very flattering salutation to a dragoon who, emerging with a rush from an <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305054" n="467     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>adjacent stable, had trodden on one of Coddles' little paws, and sent her off howling piteously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305056">The soldier bolted back into the stable with a very red face, and Miss Polly observed, in commiserating tones, that Coddles really was so tiny one couldn't help treading on her sometimes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305057">'Never mind, old woman,' said the tall young officer tenderly, stooping down and lifting Coddles in his arms. 'We'll go down to the mess and find some sugar—sugar, Coddles!'—whereat Coddles held out her small damaged paw, with a great deal of fuss and whining, and five minutes later was frisking about as if nothing had happened</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305058">'You're an arch humbug, Coddles,' Miss Polly laughed, 'to mind a little touch like that, when we all know the skilful way you can tackle a rat half as big as yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305059">'Ah! but that lumbering brute's great hoof must have hurt her,' Trevor maintained.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305060">He could be very tender, this officer of dragoons. Not for anything would he have broken his word to that little dog, and deprived her of the sugar he had promised; not the most perfect specimen of her kind that ever took a first prize at the Crystal Palace or any other show could have put that silver-coated lady's nose out of joint.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305061">But then, with him, as with most of us, dog-love was different. We don't grow weary of our dogs; with them, if they have once possessed it, our affection remains; they never pass into the things that have been unless they die, and even then there is never one that <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> comes up to the especial one who was <hi rend="italic">the</hi> dog of our hearts, over whose death we shed as bitter tears as for our dearest friend. We don't grow weary of our dogs—of the dogs that we love. It is only of the one whom we have loved with the best, greatest, purest love that can live in the human breast that we grow weary. 'Faithful as a dog.' Ah! but it is very seldom that we find so great an extent of faithfulness in the heart of man or woman; perhaps that accounts for it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305063">Why are men so strange a mixture of tenderness and cruelty? Is that the reason why weak women love them? It was surely strange that Trevor, entering the mess with his heart full of commiseration for Coddles, surfeiting her with sugar, which was bad for her, by way of compensation for what she had already forgotten, should have gone to the desk, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305062" n="468     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>and, without an instant's hesitation, have written a reply to Lord Cuffe's letter—words which, in their careless cruelty, would be as a knife plunged into a girl's loving heart. Ah yes, indeed, men love dogs and women differently—at least some men.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_239" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305064">PERHAPS during the whole of his seven-and-twenty years Trevor had never been so much in love with anyone as with Lady Rosamonde Shaughnassy—certainly never so exclusively in love. When I say that, my reader must not think me too severe. To a nature like his variety was as needful as a mixed diet is to everyone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305065">During the time he was in the society of Lady Rosamonde, the nine great Venuses, changed from the pure beauty of marble to the more thrilling loveliness of living breathing women of flesh and blood, might have been seated at the table with him each day, and his eyes would never have wandered from the clear white complexion and proud blue eyes which went to make up the charm that bound him like a spell. For eight whole months he had never found the beauty of any other woman's face thrust the vision of hers away from the pedestal on which he had placed it—the pedestal which, in his own mind, he called the perfection of beauty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305066">Then came Miss Gale's strong bold face and great black blazing eyes, and straightway the delicate tints of the past love faded before the more glowing colours of the newer fancy. A splendid woman he thought her; such a breadth of shoulder! such an inward curve to the waist! such an outward curve to the bust and hips! such massive statuesque arms! such very white hands!—not, between you and me, small hands, nor particularly well-shapen—hands, indeed, that before he had been a week at Abbot-Royal he decided lacked breeding, for they were thick in the fingers, and short as to the nails, with a thick, resolute, fleshy palm betraying descent from many and many a generation of hewers of wood and drawers of water.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305067">Now, Mr. Alan Trevor, like many another man of long descent, thought more of the personal signs of it than of any actual beauty of face; such signs had a greater charm for him than all the wealth of the Indies or all the beauty of Art.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305068" n="469     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305069">So the first thing he discovered, after he had been a few days at Abbot-Royal, was that Miss Gale was not thoroughbred. Perhaps Abbot-Royal itself had something to do with it; the place oppressed him, the money, which met him at every turn, disgusted him. From roof to basement the house was carpeted with velvet-pile of the deepest crimson hue; he detested velvet-pile! Accustomed to clanking up and down the stone-flagged corridors and steps of a barrack—his own home was great in oak and parquetry—it was a continual annoyance to him to come against some confounded maid-servant every time he ventured into the labyrinth of passages which led from his bed-chamber to the reception-rooms below. Not that he objected to the maid-servants, particularly when they were pretty, but those beastly velvet-pile carpets prevented him hearing whether anyone else was likely to come upon them likewise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305070">Then, after a few days, it worried him inexpressibly to dine daily at a table having gold plate to the value of five thousand pounds. It was not the plate that worried him—he was too well accustomed to plate for that—but what he was not accustomed to was hearing it talked about. How that five thousand pounds did weigh on his mind! for never did he seat himself at that hospitable board without a reminder from his host as to the value of his plate.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305071">After the first evening he never touched dessert; he wouldn't use the knives and forks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305072">'Beastly vulgar things!' he pronounced them, though in truth they had nothing vulgar about them but their cost; they had cost a lot, for the handles were of carved agate, and the blades were pure gold. If he had heard nothing about their price, Trevor would have said they were lovely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305073">But so great had his dislike for money become, that one evening he observed in an undertone to a guest of his own class (I did not say, did I, that the Abbot-Royal people were cotton-cords of the wealthiest order?):</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305074">'Did you ever hear "Jerusalem the Golden"?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305075">'Yes, of course,' answered the other, puzzled to know what he meant.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305076">'I hope it won't be anything like this,' he growled in disgusted tones. 'I never knew before what it was to have too much of a good thing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305077">'Rather oppressive, ain't it?' said the other with a laugh.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305078" n="470     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305079">At first Trevor had been immensely struck by Miss Gale; then it dawned upon him that she was rather loud. She couldn't ride, and she had big feet—regular beetle-crushers. Her shoulders, if broad, were also thick; in short, she was very much indeed the first of the three generations.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305080">And she sang, too, with a voice like herself—big, loud, metallic—brassy, Lord William would have called it; and it was somewhat uncultivated, for she was not very young, and the Gale wealth was not very old, so that her education was scarcely a match for the gold plate and the velvet-pile carpets. Trevor, listening to her rendering of 'Voi che sapete' in Anglo-Italian, and with plenty of vigour in the accompaniment, remembered the Lady Rosamonde, with her high-bred air and person, and sighed—Lady Rosamonde, whose instrument was an Amati, upon which she played with a perfection that was the gift of genius.</p><q><l>'Gelo e poi sento, <hi rend="italic">ff</hi></l><l>L'alma avvampar <hi rend="italic">fff</hi></l><l>E in un momento <hi rend="italic">ffff</hi></l><l>Torno a gelar.' <hi rend="italic">ffff fortissimo</hi>.</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305081">Trevor would have liked to have stuffed his fingers into his ears and groaned, but as such a proceeding was altogether impracticable, he vowed within himself that, sooner than endure this torture during his whole life, he would go back to his debts and his difficulties, even if they should take him through the unpleasant process of the Bankruptcy Court. 'Why, hang it all,' he said to himself, ' that little gray-eyed housemaid I meet sometimes in our corridor has more style by half. Oh, I <hi rend="italic">hate</hi> a woman who sings!' he added aloud to his friend Fane.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305082">'But it's the regular thing. What would you have 'em do?' Fane asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305083">'The violin's the only instrument for a woman,' Trevor answered testily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305084">'Ah, my friend, that is it, is it?' Fane said, laughing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305086">That was so exactly it that Trevor betook himself away from Abbot-Royal without going through the ceremony of asking the heiress of the house to become his wife, though it was the course he had fully intended to follow when he went there. It is very probable that, had he done so, Miss Gale would politely, and with much tenderness, have declined the situation he had to offer. Young ladies who are what in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305085" n="471     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>his disgust he disdainfully styled 'cotton-heiresses,' do not often throw themselves away on penniless subs, even though they are good-looking, and of good family to boot; they marry like the housemaids, to better themselves.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305087">However, Trevor did not give Miss Gale the opportunity of refusing him, but politely, and with many courteous expressions as to the joy and delight his visit had afforded him, shook the dust of Abbot-Royal off his feet, and, as he went to the station in the smartest of dogcarts, dashed himself if he would ever set foot within the doors again. And a very unthankful spirit to betray! We must put it down to the fact that though, while under the glamour of the spell cast by Miss Gale's bold black eyes, he had been sufficiently prudent to withstand the temptation Lord Cuffe's invitation had been to him, the fascination of Lady Rosamonde's delicate beauty was not yet dead; it had only slumbered awhile; he had suffered temporarily from what he savagely called complete idiocy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305088">However, as he had so entirely declined Lord Cuffe's invitation, he could not change his mind and go to Cuffe Castle now. He had a good mind, a very good mind, to write and say frankly that if they would have him he would throw over his other engagements. Then the old ground had to be all gone over again—the debts, the life assurances, the post-obits and the mortgages, and the seven hundred a year that was <hi rend="italic">not</hi> clear; so at last he decided that it was no good, and that he had best keep clear of the folly of matrimony whilst he could</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305089">'If I stay away,' this young philosopher said to himself, 'I shall not be wanting to make such an ass of myself. No one but Rosy ever suggested the idea of marrying—to my heart. Come, Alan Trevor, old man, don't be a fool! Keep clear of this, and you'll be in love with somebody else in a week.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305091">So he was—<hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>.! From Abbot-Royal he went home, remaining at the ancestral mansion a month. Such a thing was unparalleled in the annals of that generation of the Trevor family; such a thing had not happened since Alan had left Eton. His mother, thinking each day to hear of his departure, wondered what had come to him. Knowing him well, poor soul! she began to think his finances were in a worse state even than usual. That Barmby had an attrac-<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305090" n="472     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>tion strong enough to detain him for a whole month Mrs. Trevor could hardly have believed, even if Alan himself had told her. The household, or, rather, family, consisted of his father and mother, a young sister—for the three elder daughters were married—a younger brother, and an ancient great-aunt of exceedingly cranky temper and large fortune. Pooh! the idea was absurd. But the cranky-tempered aunt had a companion—a little soft-eyed, clinging creature, who gave in to Alan's fascinations before he had been in the house four-and-twenty hours—little body of somewhat lax principles, who was content to be ignored in public, and paid for so doing in gloves and kisses in private; who was willing to steal out of her room when the house was wrapped in silence, and go down to the smoking-room—the Squire did not smoke, and never entered it—there to listen to and believe Alan's protestations that she was the prettiest little woman in Christendom, by Jove! and how it was a beastly shame she should be doing slavey to his cantankerous old aunt; how she ought to be mistress of Barmby, and if he wasn't such a miserably poor beggar, over head and ears in debt and difficulty, why——And there Mr. Alan Trevor was wont to break off into silence infinitely more eloquent than words, leaving Miss Imogene Brown to finish the assertion up in whatever manner she thought best.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305092">And so for a month poor Imogene, being scarcely better than an idiot, went about her business, fancying herself far too good for it—dreaming she was the heroine of a romance, such as she had read of scores of times—romances in which the heroine is a young person in the lowest walks of life—as often as not, a gamekeeper's daughter—very, very much lower than Imogene—who, going into some great family as a menial, or maybe a governess, immediately subjugates the handsome master, the handsomer uncle, or the handsomest son, and, having begun as a stick, ends as a social rocket of the very first magnitude. She saw herself following the drum with Alan, surrounded by a crowd of admiring brother officers, fêted and petted, and generally made much of; then coming back to take her position in the county as Mrs. Trevor of Barmby—for mentally she popped the Squire under the daisies without any compunction.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305094">The winter days slipped by—Mrs. Trevor more puzzled, Imogene more foolish and dreamy, Alan more spoony and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305093" n="473     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>more lavish of his assertions than ever. Then, all at once, there was a check—a check so utterly and entirely unlooked for that it came with the effect of an earthquake, uprooting everything. It came with the post-bag, and in the form of a letter; it came at breakfast-time.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305095">'Lawyer's letter for you, Alan,' observed Mr. Trevor shortly; he did not by any means approve of his son's business correspondence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305096">Alan went on eating grilled kidneys and teasing his young sister, Betty, laying the letter beside his plate with admirable placidity. It happened, however, that his wonderful serenity of temper was not inherited from his father's family, and the sight of that unopened letter very nearly drove the Squire into a frenzy of irritation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305097">'Why the deuce don't you open that letter, Alan?' he asked testily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305098">'I prefer my breakfast hot, sir,' returned his son, handing his cup to be replenished.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305099">After a moment's pause, the Squire broke out again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305100">'I don't know how you can sit with that letter unopened,' he observed, drumming impatiently on the table with his fingers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305101">'Open it yourself, sir,' suggested Alan easily, pushing the letter to Betty as he spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305102">'Certainly not, Alan. I never opened a letter addressed to anyone else in my life, sir,' he announced pompously, yet with such an air of resignation that Alan, with a groan at his father's worrying disposition, tore open the cover.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305103">But as the contents of the letter became apparent to him, the groan of affectation changed into a very real gasp for breath, and, as was always the case with him under extreme emotion, every drop of blood fled from his face, leaving it of the ashen hue of death.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305104">'Alan, my boy!' Mrs. Trevor cried, stretching out her hand to him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305105">Alan began to laugh shakily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305106">'Old Soames has left me all his money—eighty thousand pounds,' he said, in a husky voice. 'I must go up to town at once;' an as he spoke he saw, with a great pang of dismay, the flash of overwhelming joy in the soft gray eyes on the other side of the table. Oh, the seed we sow, that others may reap the harvest thereof!</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305107" n="474     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305108">Within an hour he and Greene were ready to start. Trevor had hoped to get out of the house without encountering the glance of those radiant eyes again; but when he came out of his room Imogene was sitting in one of the window-seats of the gallery waiting for him, and flew to him with outstretched arms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305109">'Oh, I am so glad!' she cried—'so glad! I was afraid you would go before I could wish you joy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305110">'Thank you, Imogene dear. Yes, it is a great stroke of luck for me; it will clear me of all my difficulties,' he answered, kissing her, and smoothing back her soft brown hair from her forehead.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305111">'And, Mr. Alan, you won't forget me, now that you are rich?' she said shyly. 'You'll come back to me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305112">'Of course I shall come back.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305113">Then he put her arms from about his neck, kissed her again, and rushed off.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305114">Half an hour later he was in the train, alone with Coddles and his thoughts—free to think now that the way to winning Lady Rosamonde was clear; his sweet blue-eyed love, whom by his poverty he had been obliged to wound—that was the way he put it to himself. Well, it was all different now; the road was clear; no obstacle lay between them—except the girl he had left behind him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305115">'And oh, by Heaven, what a villain I am!' he cried aloud. Between ourselves, reader, I don't think he was out of it.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_240" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305116">FROM Barmby Trevor went up to town, there to attend his godfather's funeral; and from town he wrote to Lord Cuffe, saying that circumstances had altered his engagements, and if they would have him for a week at Cuffe, he should be delighted to visit them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305117">Lord Cuffe's reply was frank and hearty as himself. 'Come as soon as you like, and stay as long as you like. Your friend Josselyn is still here,' he wrote.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305118">So Trevor packed up his traps again, and set off on his journey, carrying as light a heart as ever man went wooing with. A good passage across, a few hours in Dublin to buy half a dozen diamond rings, which he had not had time to get in London, then down to Cuffe.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305120">How good it all was! How different the shabby dogcart, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305119" n="475     OLD LOVE OR NEW?"/>with a raking chestnut flyer, to the glossy and ponderous carriage that had met him at Abbot-Royal—a break big enough to have been a furniture-van! How good the courteous message, delivered in the rich brogue, 'that me lord was very sorry, but he couldn't come to meet the jintleman, havin' to be on the bench'! How good the great pile of ivy-covered buildings, half ruined though they were! How most good of all the greeting of the old butler, who told him my lady was in the great hall with Captain Josselyn! It was at this point, however, that the measure of his goodness became mixed and suddenly turned to evil, for, as he entered the hall over a worn Turkey carpet, quite as deadening to noise as the obnoxious velvet pile at Abbot-Royal, he was just in time to see Lady Rosamonde lift her head from Josselyn's shoulder, and Josselyn take his arm from about Lady Rosamonde's waist.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305121">In that one moment, that one glance of comprehension, Mr. Alan Trevor gathered in his harvest, not ten, nor twenty, nor thirty, but a thousandfold; in the bitterness of the sweet welcome Lady Rosamonde gave him; in the bitterness of the sweet smiling eyes that looked so straight into his own, as if wondering that their owner could have seen anything in him to remember for eight whole months; in the bitterness of hearing the soft rich voice call his friend Charlie; and in the tenfold bitterness of the moment when that friend held out his hand, saying: 'Wish me joy, old fellow, won't you?' For one instant he was tempted to refuse the hand—the hand of his best friend; to blurt out the truth; to say he was her first love, and she his; and then Memory and Conscience stepped in and bade him take the hand, and admit that he deserved his fate. Memory reminded him of new loves with black eyes, and newer ones with gray. Conscience told him that for him old loves would have been best, and added, in no measured terms, that for Lady Rosamonde the case was entirely reversed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305122">And Love stood by with sad eyes and listened, while Conscience told him the bitterest and most unpalatable of truths—'You have only yourself to thank for it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305123">Poor Trevor! Between Love and Memory and Conscience he had but a sorry time of it. Although he had sown for others to reap, he was yet gathering in his harvest with a vengeance.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305124" n="476     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_241" n="10" type="story"><head>MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305125">His name was Jérome St. Etienne, and I need hardly say he was a Frenchman. What he had been in his native country he did not at first tell anyone, but I can tell you that he was well educated, that he came over to this country after the affair of '48, clad in a blouse—a blue one—with a stock-in-trade consisting of a tray and an assortment of plaster images and holy-water stoups, and that he took his stand on one of the bridges of a large English city, which was also a garrison town, expressing himself volubly, to everyone who was sufficiently interested in him to listen, that he was a child of the people, that he wore the garb of liberty, and that he had left la belle France to take care of herself, meaning for the present to earn an honest living out of his tray of plaster images and holy-water stoups, though, as was represented to him, it was an occupation unsuited alike to him and to the country of his adoption.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305126">However, for a long time St. Etienne held firmly to his resolution, and was to be seen daily on the bridge in question, with his little trumpery wares exposed for sale. But somehow they did not sell; the ordinary English men or women of the class likely to buy goods in the street don't care to spend hard earnings in plaster effigies of persons of note of whom they have never heard, or saints whose images they would term 'graven.' True, one day a woman asked the price of an article she called a <hi rend="italic">pot!</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305127">St. Etienne took off his cap politely, and replied in his own tongue:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305128">'C'est un bénitier, madame.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305129">' Hey?' said she blankly (she had thought it might be useful as a receptacle for pins); then, raising her voice,' How much?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305130">'Ow môche?' St. Etienne repeated. It was the only scrap of English he knew. 'Foppence happney.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305131">' Fourpence ha'p'ny? an' plenty too. Well, I'll take it,' said the woman, and walked off with her bénitier, wondering all day however poor French folks manage to conduct the ordinary business of life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305132">'I suppose they understand one another,' she said, as she hung the stoup on a nail; 'but it do seem queer to think of child prating that lingo.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305133" n="477     MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305134">Well, on the whole, business did not thrive well with St. Etienne. Very few people seemed to care about the images, and still fewer thought of utilizing a <hi rend="italic">bénitier</hi> as a pin-tray. Winter drew nigh, and St. Etienne's blue blouse got very shabby; his face grew very thin and haggard, his passionate asseverations that he was a child of the people, <hi rend="italic">vive la liberté, l' égalité, la fraternité</hi>, and all the rest of it, became less frequent, and he began to find that the country of his adoption was indeed a hard one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305135">There are many animals which may be starved into doing certain things that otherwise they can neither be driven nor led into doing. St. Etienne found himself, from no very great condition of affluence, put upon a bread-and-water diet—not only a bread-and-water diet, but one in which there was a good deal of water to a very small quantity of bread—after a short course of which he became more amenable to reason, and consented to yield to the truth of a suggestion that he might find some better employment for his brains and his fingers than by selling plaster images which nobody wanted to buy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305136">In short, just at this time the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi> of the 6th Lancers, then stationed in the town, happened to fall sick, and eventually died. A few days later, one of the young officers suggested jokingly that, after having had so excellent a French cook, they couldn't possibly do with an English one, and he shouldn't be a bit surprised if that queer chap who stood with a trayful of images on the West-point Bridge wasn't the very man to suit their purpose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305137">A joke—made and received, as was intended, as a joke, but yet a joke that, spoken in jest, became earnest, for, on inquiry being made of St. Etienne himself, it was found he had been head-cook in the kitchen of a French nobleman, and was a treasure to be valued above measure.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305138">So he resigned the garb of liberty, acknowledging that a coat was infinitely more comfortable. He proved a superb cook, was generous, warm-hearted and industrious, and very soon floated out of the shallows of poverty into the deeper waters of prosperity, called the regiment his salvation, and, after a while, got married.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305140">His wife, a clever woman, set up a laundry, and took the officers' washing; and so the pair thrived, and St. Etienne lived a comfortable English life, as if such storms as '48—<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305139" n="478     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><hi rend="italic">liberté, égalité, fraternité</hi>—a passion for blue blouses and plaster images, had never once swept across his dramatic, fiery Gaulic soul.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305141">But the excitable, dramati' fiery spirit was still there; it was dormant, but not dead. We hear that the age of chvalry is past—that it died out with doublet and with silken hose Stuff and nonsense! When Jérome St. Etienne had been long enough in Britain to have become a British subject, an incident occurred which, while it raised a great roar of laughter though-out the whole regiment—nay throughout the town is which the 6th were quartered—gaind for him the name of Monsieur le Chevalier, and made hundreds of hearty Englishmen hold out their hearty, honest hand to him—that made hundreds of throats send up as deafening cheers as ever greeted heroes from the field of battle—which, won for him the respect of every man who heard the story, the respect that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> men give to one who takes up the cause of the little weakly ones in the mighty battle of life.</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'Where the foes are gathered on every hand</l><l>And rest not day or night,</l><l>And the feeble little ones must stand</l><l>In the thickest of the fight.'</l></lg></q><milestone rend="inline" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305142">And now we must leave Jérome St Etienne and I will take you to a large, rather third-rate ladies' school on the outskirts of the town where at that time, the 6th Lancers were quartered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305143">I use the term 'third-rate advisedly. It was not a school for the daughters of gentlemen, but of farmers and smaller tradesmen—a school the mistress of which, understood not one word of any language save he own. Had it been otherwise, then this story had never bee written.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305144">This lady did not profess to teach anything beyond a good plain English education, and here were many Pupils who did not learn French.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305145">But for those who did desire to learn it Mrs. Morton felt, like a sensible woman, that it was best to have a, French governess. She therefore seemed a young lady, to whom she paid a trifling salary, in addition to her board and lodging and the opportunity of learning English.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305147">It was a good arrangement for the schoolmistress, nor was it a bad one for the French girl; she had a good roof to cover <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305146" n="479     MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER"/>her, a good bed to sleep on, fair food to eat, and certainly plenty of it. She had a salary which, since she was a French-woman, and could make a shilling do the work of half a crown (so I am told, yet I find a French bonnet costs just twice as much as an English one—odd that, rather), would clothe her decently, and a principal who, if she couldn't exchange a word with her, had always a pleasant smile for her and very often a motherly kiss.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305148">On the other hand, this girl had the world—<hi rend="italic">the world</hi>—nothing but the world—a world of strangers. Father, mother, brother or sister she had none. She stood alone,
<q><l>'A feeble little one . . .</l><l>In the thickest of the fight.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305149">Poor feeble one!—she was only seventeen—at the best it was but a dull life. She was slow to learn English, and her pupils were infinitely slower to learn French. She had no one with whom to exchange an idea, and the luxury of a 'good talk' was one she seemed never likely to enjoy again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305150">However, three months slipped over, and then the schoolmistress paid her her salary—four golden sovereigns. On the first half-holiday she went into the town with the best French-speaking pupil that she might buy a pair of boots, which had been a necessity long enough. It happened that this very girl was going to spend the evening with friends, so when the boots were satisfactorily purchased, Mademoiselle de Rochefontaine escorted her to their house, returning home alone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305151">While walking leisurely along the semi-rural road, she was startled by hearing herself addressed in her native tongue—her dear native tongue, fluently spoken, and with the purest Parisian accent. She looked up from an absorbing calculation as to how far she would be able to make her four sovereigns go, and found a stranger standing uncovered beside her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305152">This stranger was tall, elderly, and gray-haired, with that grand air of distinction of which you see so much more across the Channel than you do in this pushing, go-ahead country of ours. To Diane de Rochefontaine, after three months—they seemed more like years—spent amongst second- or even third-rate people, his manner had the perfect polish of the good society to which she had been accustomed in her youth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305154">He turned and walked beside her, telling her he had heard of her some days before, that they were relations, he being the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305153" n="480     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>head of her family, le Duc de Rochefontaine. Then he went on to tell her his history—such a sad one—how he had lost all his property in the affair of '48, which Diane could just remember, and in which her own father had suffered his most severe losses; how he had been exiled by Napoleon, and had come with his wife to this country, teaching, writing, sometimes even begging to keep their respective bodies and souls together; how they had got from bad to worse, so as to be almost homeless, and the wife, the poor delicately-nurtured wife, born of the highest noblesse of the Faubourg, lay dying of that terrible malady, <hi rend="italic">cancer</hi>—lay in a poor garret, without a doctor, without food, save of the poorest and coarsest, suffering such agonies that she had many times implored him, if he had any love or pity for her at all, to kill her, and so put her out of her misery.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305155">What a story! Diane was young, tender of heart, and among a strange people. Monsieur le Duc was her compatriot—nay, her distant kinsman. What wonder was it that, as she listened, the brightness seemed to fade from the sky?—perhaps because her eyes were full of tears. She forgot all her wants of dress—and Heaven knows they were many—and out of the shabby little purse, tightly clasped in her hand, she took one of the three remaining hardly-won sovereigns.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305156">'I am not rich, sir,' she said with her grand air of courtesy; ' but it shall never be said that I am not ready to share my all with a compatriot in distress.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305157">Monsieur le Duc was overwhelmed; he clasped her hand to his heart; he even went so far as to shed a few tears over it. Diane turned away with corresponding tears in her own sympathetic eyes, and, running up to her own little room, wept passionately—partly for the tale of sorrow she had heard, partly for her own utter loneliness and the many trials of the unhappy children of that bright country to which her yearning eyes would ever look, even as the Mohammedan looks and yearns towards Mecca, the holy city.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305158">Poor dear little woman! She thought of the kindly eyes, now closed in death, which would have brightened at her act of charity, and she felt, with a thrill of triumph, that if they could look from heaven, not even the joys of paradise could prevent them feeling pleasure that she, all desolate as she was, had been able, even in her poverty, to alleviate the unhappiness and pains of her two unfortunate kinsfolk.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305159" n="481     MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305160">' They are more desolate than I', she said, looking round the room and thinking of the schoolmistress's good-night kisses.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305161">She wondered if she should ever see him again—that poor, desolate, melancholy gentleman. Poor, innocent child! she need not have wondered—she saw him many times. The wife grew worse, his tale more harrowing, Diane's tender heart more pitying; but at last her little store of money came to an end, and she could help no more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305162">'I must have help, 'he cried; ' my poor wife lies gasping out her life in agony and torment. I will kill her, and curse heaven and die; then, <hi rend="italic">surely</hi>, we shall be at peace.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305163">Diane, poor innocent, began to weep; then she bethought herself of a ring which had been her mother's—the only article of value she possessed. She grew sick at the idea of parting with it—her mother's ring—but only for a moment, Then she drew it off her finger and laid it in his hand.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305164">'Take it,' she said gently. 'It is the only thing of value that I possess. I would it were more!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305165">But that was not the last of him; he met her again, <hi rend="italic">demanding</hi> money.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305166">' I have none,' said the girl sadly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305167">' You must find it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305168">' I cannot', she cried. Suddenly a gleam of the truth dawned upon her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305169">' You will not?' he hissed, all at once throwing off his mask. ' Then I will ruin you; do you understand?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305170">The girl stood staring at him in frozen, speechless horror; the vision of the sick wife faded. She remembered her hard-earned money, her tender sympathy, her pleasant flush of triumph; she thought of her ring—the ring which had been her dead mother's, and then, without one word, she turned back within the gates, ran up to her room, and, flinging herself upon her little bed, broke down into the most bitter sobs and tears she had ever shed in her whole life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305172">Thus a housemaid, sent to summon her to tea, found her, and in a fright fetched the schoolmistress, who simply could not make head or tail of the child's story. After listening to her incoherent statement, and saying ' Yes, yes,' at intervals by way of soothing her, she stood, wondering if it would be best to let her cry her cry out, or send for a doctor; and whilst she was deliberating, a servant entered with a card, and said, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305171" n="482     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>'A gentleman, 'm.' Mrs. Morton took the card, which bore a coronet, and read aloud:
<q><l>'LE DUC DE ROCHEFONTAINE.</l></q>
What can he want, I wonder? Can he have anything to do with mam'zelle?' she mused. 'Well, I must go and see what he wants.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305173">Poor little mam'zelle had ceased her sobs, and lay moaning as if in pain, and shuddering piteously. The schoolmistress feeling very odd and upset herself, left her and went down to the drawing-room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305174">'I am sorry I cannot speak French, your grace,' she said on entering; she knew an English duke was so addressed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305175">'I speak English vare well, madame,' said <hi rend="italic">his grace</hi>, with a profound bow.' I have taken myself the liberty of calling; you have a young <hi rend="italic">personne</hi> in your house, <hi rend="italic">called</hi>'—strongly emphasizing the word—'de Rochefontaine.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305176">'Yes, Mam'zelle de Rochefontaine. What about her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305177">'I am sorry to say she is an imposterre,' answered <hi rend="italic">his grace</hi> emphatically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305178">'Oh no; I had a written recommendation from the wife of the French Ambassador in London,' said the schoolmistress stiffly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305179">'I am aware; that was a forgery. The young <hi rend="italic">personne</hi> represents herself of my family. She comes from my part of France; her father is a small shopkeeper in the town of which I am what you call the squire, and she speak with a patois so terrible as to make her quite unfit for the position of <hi rend="italic">gouverante</hi>. And she also is <hi rend="italic">Catholique</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305180">'No, no! Protestant; she goes to church regularly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305181">'<hi rend="italic">Catholique!</hi>' Monsieur le Duc persisted quietly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305182">'And you say she does not speak good French?' the schoolmistress gasped.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305183">'Patois '—with a grand wave of the hand—' or, as you would say, the dialeck.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305184">The schoolmistress thought of the letter the French girl had brought with her—of the storm of tears she had just witnessed. She looked at the tall, well-dressed man, who had a riband in his button-hole, and a grand air, and she believed him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305185">'Out of my house the hussy goes this very night!' she cried angrily.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305186" n="483     MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305187">Then Monsieur le Due de Rochefontaine, having fulfilled his word, departed, and Diane was cast upon the world alone—literally thrust out upon the world in the darkness of a chill October evening. I would have you think of it—you who read my story. Mothers who have young daughters, wives who have brave, loving husbands to guard you from harm, daughters who know not what it is to venture beyond the safe shelter of your father's roof—I say I would have you think of the position this girl, Diane de Rochefontaine, found herself in when the angry schoolmistress thrust her from her door without even a hearing. Try to realize it; she was friendless, homeless, and alone, without money, without possessions, save her few poor clothes, without the fair character which had been hers from her cradle—alone in a strange land, among a people of whose tongue she knew but a few words.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305188">Can you wonder that her weak lance failed her? Can you wonder that her heart, brave and true as it was, quailed utterly, when foes, the like of which she had never even thought of before, seemed to crowd around her and flaunt their hideousness in her sad face? Heaven only knows what thoughts came into the girl's mind then—thoughts of hunger, cold, death. Can you wonder that, as she sank down beside the lonely road and prayed to God that she might die and be at rest, the thought of a deep swift river but a hundred yards away came to her with a strange, alluring, soothing sweetness? Poor feeble little one, who found herself indeed
<q><l>'In the thickest of the fight.'</l></q></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305189">But it is not always thus that our feeble brothers and sisters are trampled under foot. Even while the girl crouched under the railing, almost exhausted by her grief, there came that way another son of France, a real aristocrat this time, though he wielded a cook's ladle, and was commonly known in the 6th Lancers as ' Frenchy,' or sometimes as 'Froggie.' He heard the sobs and stopped short.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305190">`Hal—lo! what is ze mattare? Are you hurt, mees? Can I assist you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305192">And then he gathered, not the story, for the girl was too excited to tell it, but the fact that a young countrywoman of his own was in dire distress. It was enough for him; he fetched a cab and took her home to his wife, who petted her <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305191" n="484     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>and made much of her, until she was able to tell them what had befallen her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305193">It was then that all the passionate, fiery, dramatic chivalry, so long pent up by English coldness and conventionality, broke out. St. Etienne's original nature seemed to burst forth; his wife hardly knew him. He happened to know all about the so-called Monsieur le Duc de Rochefontaine, his family, his pretension to rank, and his lazy, slippery, underhand life; but this—this merciless persecution of a friendless and orphan girl was a new revelation, and it made him almost beside himself. He raved, he stormed, he choked, he gesticulated—nay, he got up and danced about the room in the excess of his passion; he kissed the child and blessed her, and then he danced off again, calling on every saint in the calendar and out of it to pour down curses and misfortunes upon the inhuman brute who had done this inhuman thing. Nay, his passion carried him so far that he forgot the mess-dinner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305194">'I care not for ze dinner,' he raved, when his wife reminded him of it; whereupon that more prosaic person went off into the kitchen and told the second cook something very dreadful had happened to put her husband out, and they would just have to manage the dinner as best they could without him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305195">And when she went back again, St. Etienne was raving and gobbling still, and finally, having succeeded in sending the over-wrought child into violent hysterics, he seized his hat and danced himself out of the room, muttering and gesticulating as he went right across the square to the Colonel's quarters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305196">' Wot's up, mossoo?' questioned a big lancer, whom he passed on the road.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305197">Receiving no reply, he observed with a good-natured laugh to a comrade that he was a queer little chap, but good-natured, he did believe, down at the bottom of him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305198">As for St. Etienne, he just danced up to the door of the Colonel's sitting-room, and began such a tattoo on the panel thereof that the Colonel in a rage dashed across the room and flung open the door with an angry, ' What the devil do you mean, sir?' then, seeing it was the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi>, added: ' What's the matter?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305199">But St. Etienne couldn't tell him; he burst into the room positively speechless with rage, and gobbled like a turkey in a passion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305201">The chief, who was half dressed for mess, stared at him in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305200" n="485     MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER"/>open-mouthed amazement; to have the mess-cook invading his quarters in this way was something entirely novel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305202">'What is it? What's the matter?' he asked, concluding something serious had happened.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305203">By degrees the story was told in all its enormity—not told straight away, but interspersed with interludes in the shape of divers strange-sounding French ejaculations, varied by sundry dances about the room. I am bound to relate that Colonel Vandeleur, in spite of his sympathy with the girl and his disgust at the story, was so tickled by St. Etienne's transports of rage and the absurd effect he produced, when every now and again he broke off his story to execute a regular war-dance, that he simply sat and roared with laughter till the tears ran down his face and he was speechless. And the more the Colonel laughed, into yet greater transports of rage did St. Etienne go.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305204">'You may laugh, my Colonel,' he cried. 'Vhen I have flogged him, I too shall laugh. He shall pay. I will thrash him—I will thrash him within von inch of his wretched, miserable life. He shall pay—oh, that scoundrel, that bad villain! But he shall pay.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305205">'Now, come, come, St. Etienne,' said the Colonel, trying hard to regain his gravity. 'It won't do to get yourself into trouble. The law here does not allow that sort of thing, and, of course, we shall make it all right for the poor girl.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305206">'Won't do!' the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi> screamed, then got up and beat his two clenched fists together in the excess of his fury, and pounded away as if he had the delinquent's head between them. ' Won't do! I tell you, my Colonel, it must and it shall do. I will flog—I shall thrash, I tell you, within von inch of his wretched life. Will it cost five pounds? Can I thrash him for five pounds—ten pounds?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305207">The Colonel began to laugh again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305208">I'm sure I don't know. I wouldn't advise you to try.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305209">'I tell you, my Colonel, I must,' he reiterated. 'If I sat still and did nothing, I—I—I should burst myself. Oh, he—oh—h—h—h—he shall pay—that villain, if I go to prison—if it cost me ten—twenty pounds; oh, but he shall pay—that—that scoundrel—ugh—gh—eck!' And then he danced off again sending the Colonel into a more agonizing roar of laughter than ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305211">'Now, look here, St. Etienne,'were the Colonel's last words<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305210" n="486     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>when the <hi rend="italic">chef</hi> took a frantic adieu, ' don't you do anything rash; the brute's not worth it. If you <hi rend="italic">must</hi> thrash him, go into the town and consult Mr. Scrope. See what it will cost you first.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305212">So to Scrope, the first lawyer in the town, St. Etienne betook himself, demanding to know ' ow môche—'ow big a thrashing he could administer to Monsieur le Duc—otherwise Jean Mattys—for five pounds.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305213">'Oh, you can very nearly kill him, under the circumstances,' the lawyer laughed; 'but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> wouldn't. What's the good of wasting your money? You'd much better give it to the girl, and I'll give you something to put to it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305214">He might just as well have told a volcano not to cast up lava, if it were so minded; he might as well have ordered a waterfall to stand still. St. Etienne dashed down half a sovereign on the table, which the lawyer told him he didn't want, and danced away again back to barracks, there to tell, in guard-room and troop-room, in sergeants' mess, and, finally, up in one of the young officers' rooms to a select audience, the whole miserable story over and over again, with renewed assurances of ''ow he shall pay.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305215">'You're quite right, St. Etienne; give the brute a regular good hiding,' laughed one of the subalterns; 'and if they take you up and fine you, I'll pay the fines with pleasure.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305216">Very early the following morning—by nine o'clock, indeed—St. Etienne sallied out, followed by two young officers on horseback, who had got leave from morning stables for the mere fun of seeing the row. They had not long to wait, for, by good luck, Etienne met his compatriot in one of the principal streets, and, falling upon him forthwith, administered so unmerciful a thrashing that half a dozen stalwart 'peelers' could scarcely drag him away from his victim. Bruised, bleeding, and almost senseless, Mattys did indeed present a pitiable appearance, and on the following morning, when St. Etienne, after a night spent in the police-cells, was taken before the magistrates on a charge of aggravated assault, why, the case against him looked a very black one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305218">However, his lawyer, Scrope, pleading extenuating circumstances, obtained a week's remand. Half a dozen officers, including the Colonel, came forward to go bail for St. Etienne, and he was afterwards escorted back to barracks by an enthusiastic crowd of lancers, who made as much fuss about <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305217" n="487     MONSIEUR LE CHEVALIER"/>him as if he had won the Derby with nothing better than a troop-horse.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305219">A week later the case came on again: the real merits of the affair transpired, and its aspect was considerably changed. Several of the senior officers came forward and spoke to the high character of the prisoner, and the number of years he had been with the regiment. The schoolmistress told her story—Mademoiselle de Rochefontaine told hers. A letter was produced in court from the wife of the French Ambassador at the Court of St. James's, fully corroborating Diane's story. Then St. Etienne's lawyer told <hi rend="italic">his</hi> story, over which St. Etienne fairly danced again, exulting openly in the fact that he had nearly thrashed Mattys' life out of him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305220">Probably in no court of justice was so much laughter ever heard before—everyone roared. The Mayor sat in his big chair of office and choked; the lawyers on both sides, the witnesses, the police, and the public, especially the red-coats, laughed till it was absolutely impossible that they could laugh any longer. Then the Mayor gave sentence. He said:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305221">'We can perfectly understand your desire to punish this inhuman monster, as you very justly term him; but the law of this country does not allow a man, however righteous may be his indignation, to take such a matter as this into his own hands. Therefore we must find a verdict for the plaintiff, and sentence you to be imprisoned until the rising of the Court. As this is the last case for the day, you are at liberty to go now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305222">'Three cheers for mossoo!' cried a voice below the bar.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305223">'Three cheers for the little lady, bless her!' shouted another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305224">But St. Etienne wasn't satisfied. He went outside and executed another war-dance, and, catching sight of the impostor stealing away up the courtyard, ceased his dance and fell upon him once more, giving him such a drubbing that he very nearly thrashed him out of this world into the next. In truth, when the bystanders had got the pair apart, they thought he had accomplished that achievement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305226">They took him up again and fined him a fiver and costs, escorting Mattys out of the city. After which Jérome St. Etienne cooled down so as to hear the matter discussed without any war-dances or ejaculations, though he was never allowed to forget how he had been carried back to barracks shoulder high, and somehow they never called him 'Frenchy' or 'Froggie' any more—his pluck and his chivalry had won <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305225" n="488     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>every heart in the regiment, whether it beat under lace that was worsted or gold.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305227">As for Mademoiselle de Rochefontaine, the St. Etiennes not having accommodation proper for her, she had been taken in by an officer's wife living near the barracks. She found her misfortunes had brought her friends enough. First, the schoolmistress begged her with tears to return. Diane shook her head, but was so forgiving as to kiss her when she went away. Then Mr. Scrope announced that he had heard of a very good appointment that was open if she chose to take it. Diane shook her head again. And then the young officer who had so cheerfully paid St. Etienne's fines announced that she had already accepted a situation—for life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305228">And he said, and she said, and everybody else said, that Jérome St. Etienne had the heart of an angel in heaven.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_242" n="11" type="story"><head>A LITTLE DRESSMAKER.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305229">SHE was a little dressmaker—a needle-driver; one of those poor, hard-working, insignificant units of society who spend their days weaving webs for the gratification of others—a poor, little, slender, pale-faced maid, toiling from morning till night over rich silks and costly satins, not having even the varied and interesting branch of the business for her share; no arranging of tasty trimmings; no exercise of her ingenuity—oh no! She made buttonholes—nothing in the world but buttonholes. She made them in every class of material and every shape of garment—in gowns that were of velvet, and in those that were of cotton; in gowns that were black, or white, or pink, or blue. Variety of material and of colour she had certainly, but the buttonholes never varied, except that sometimes they were large, and sometimes they were small.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305230">Mrs. Winter tells me—and here I may say that she professes to be rather fond of stitching—that there is no more tedious process included in the whole range of work that may be done with a needle. I throw out a suggestion, and remark that a carpet, particularly if it is an old one, that must be made to fit a different room, must be pretty tiresome. Mrs. Winter pooh-poohs the idea instantly. She says women seldom or never make up carpets, and awards the palm of tediousness to buttonholes.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305231" n="489     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305232">I, naturally, not knowing much about the matter, am dumb. I examine the buttonholes of my coat, and try to count the stitches. I get half-way down one side, and then I lose count; so I give it up, and tell Mrs. Winter she is right as usual.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305233">It was, however, from that attempt that I realized the manner of life my little heroine led. If you, my reader, are of the sex which does not make buttonholes, try the experiment, and you will be able to imagine the same thing very easily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305234">In appearance she was uncommon—distinctly uncommon—in truth, there was nothing common about her. Her person was a very graceful one, even though it possessed that slenderness which was the outcome of poor and scanty food, combined with little or no exercise, and long hours of work in an unhealthy and stooping attitude. Her face was small and pale; her dark and soft hair was parted neatly in the centre, and put plainly away behind her ears; she had the biggest dark eyes I ever saw, and, moreover, they were eyes that had a wistful, half-startled expression, which added to their bigness, and perhaps added also, more than anything else, to her air of uncommonness—even more than all the rest of her body put together.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305235">But, you say, if she had such long hours of work, surely she need not have been poorly fed! Oh, sir—oh, madam, I can hear the righteous indignation in your wise voices. Pray, what do you think her weekly wage amounted to? She was well paid on account of her proficiency and dexterity at the buttonhole business, or what is called well paid in trade circles—<hi rend="italic">she had nine shillings a week!</hi> Only think of it! Just as much as you, sir, give for a bottle of champagne at your mess-table, and think very highly of yourself and your abstemiousness when you do not exceed the bottle; just as much as you, madam, gave for a single yard of the gown you are wearing this minute, and when you bought it, did you not tell yourself it was quite a moderate price? Well, that was what my heroine earned by a whole week's labour at the making of buttonholes. Out of those nine shillings she lived, found a roof to cover her, raiment to clothe her body, and food wherewith to feed it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305236">The roof was an attic roof—a very tiny one, too; the raiment was decent black; the food, Heaven knows what! And her name was Susie Harrington.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305238">Well, this hard-working maker of buttonholes—poor, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305237" n="490     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>brave little soul!—sent her needle driving along day by day and week after week, keeping on her independent, respectable way, finding her occasional pleasures, and rejoicing in them gladly—pleasures that you, my reader, would deem privations—visiting her few friends; in short, living as hundreds of orphan girls do live in this country.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305239">She was alone in the world as regarded kith and kin, but she was not without friends. Best amongst them was a certain Mrs. Sims, a soldier's widow—a regular old soldier herself, who had been on march half the world over, besides many a long and wearisome journey within the limits of the United Kingdom; she had been soldiering under its sternest aspect, for she had been through the Crimean War and the Mutiny also. To Susie Harrington, who had been from childhood of an excitable and romantic nature, her yarns were pleasures unending. Of a truth, Mrs. Sims was a wonderful woman, who went out charing, and could see the truest of true fortunes at the bottom of a teacup. Susie believed in her magical power most devoutly, and many a time got her to give her what was called a 'throw of the cup' by way of casting her horoscope.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305240">It was pretty nearly always with the same result, but that Susie did not heed: a bit of trouble—which, upon a second trial, it was found Susie could remove beautifully—a man, a ring, and an unexpected acquisition of money.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305241">'I can't tell how you read it all so plain, Mrs. Sims,' said Susie one night, with a blush. 'Wherever did you learn it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305242">'Why, my dear, I learnt it of an old Hindoo woman at Hy-der-er-ha-bad, in the Presidency of <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>,' the soldier's widow answered, 'when me an' Sims was out in India.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305243">'Oh, it's in India.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305244">'In the Presidency of <hi rend="italic">Bombay</hi>'—as if that had nothing to do with India at all. 'Ah! I shall never forget coming home through the great Desert of Sahary. We disembarked at Suez, and was two days crossing the desert; it was midnight when we got into Alexandria. Never shall I forget it; the heat were awful, and we were that tired and weary; we'd nowhere to go, and did not know where we should find a bed to sleep in. And then the Persia sent for us all to his palace, and gave us all a great supper; I never eat a better. Ay, but he were a kind gentleman, were the Persia of Egypt; he just treated us as if we'd been the highest of gentlefolks.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305245" n="491     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305246">'You've seen some strange places.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305247">Susie never had to make much conversation when she was calling on Mrs. Sims.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305248">'Yes, my dear, I have that. You see, I was born and bred to it, father having been in the army himself. Yes, he was a soldier too; his last fight were at—dear me, I forget the name—the big battle where the Duke was.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305249">'The Duke?' said Susie, puzzled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305250">'Yes, my dear—the great Duke o' Wellingtons; he never lost a battle; different to what they do nowadays. Ay, dear me, how names do slip one's memory! I have it—Waterloo. Yes, that were father's last service; I have his medal yet. Well, you see, I were born and bred to it, so to speak, though father was settled down on his pension before I was born. But, then, it was in the blood. Why, if I had the chance, I'd go roving off again to-morrow—if it weren't for my children, that is. I'd eight brothers all in the army.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305251">'All in the army!' echoed Susie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305253">'All in the army. I'd one in the Cherry-pickers, and one in the 60th Rifles. Poor Ted! he died o' sunstroke in South Africa in '57. They'd been ten years in the Bush, Kaffir fighting, and was just on the point of embarking in the <hi rend="italic">Tamar</hi> for England, when the Indian Mutiny broke out, and they were ordered to get across country from Grahamstown to Fredericks-burg, and embark there for India. They'd a march of twenty-five miles the first day—a stiffish bit in a hot climate. They got within sight of a stream just at noon, and ever so many of 'em pulled off their helmets, and ran down to the water to bathe their heads. The sun struck 'em, and as for poor Ted, his head were turned right round, so 'at he couldn't see where he was going, and he knocked his brains out against the trunk of a tree. Poor Ted! he were dead in a minute, and two others died whilst the regiment was resting. They left half a dozen behind to bury them, and just mark the spot where they lay, and afterwards they raised a stone. Ay, but that were a bad march—thirteen men and five officers all lost of sunstroke before they got to Fredericksburg—three non-commissioned officers, that is, and two commissioned. Then there were two killed in the Crimea. I've one in Australia and one in the United States, one in the 9th Lancers, and Provost-sergeant. I'd ten sisters besides, nearly all married to soldiers. One married a sergeant in the 5th Dragoon <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305252" n="492     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>Guards; a fine man he was, but he was badly wounded in the throat at Balaklava. Ay, but it was a bad business, the Crimea. I never see the like. There were nine brothers out there at one time, and only three came home again—my sister's husband one of 'em, and fit for nothing afterwards. I remember very well one morning—why, it was the very day Captain Hedley Vicars was killed; never a better gentleman lived. I was there standing by when he died; they was all hard at work in the trenches, and my sister's husband's youngest brother went for to take his turn.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305254">'"Now, then," says he, "here goes."</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305255">'"Good-bye; may you come safe back, my lad," says I.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305256">'"Good-bye," says he, and over he goes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305257">'Safe—ay, well, it wasn't an hour and a half afterwards I see them bring him up under a sheet, as dead as a door-nail; and such a fine lad he were, and only nineteen!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305258">'Killed?' cried Susie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305259">'Oh no; but them trenches made faster work with 'em nor shot an' shell. What the cholera didn't take, the blue gas did;' and then Mrs. Sims, good old soldier! strayed off into the political side of the question, making such statements concerning the Liberal leaders then and now—statements which were the result of her experience of practical soldiering—as to cause Susie, who was a regular little Radical in standing up for the buff, though she did not know the yellow policy from the blue, to feel as if her silky hair was standing straight up on end, like the locks of the famous beauty, Mademoiselle Zobedié Lûti.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305260">Well, it came about through Mrs. Sims and the fascination her soldiering yarns had for Susie, that a great change crept into the girl's life. Mrs. Sims had a son called Ted, named in memory of that other soldier Ted, who had had his head turned round and knocked his brains out against the trunk of a tree in South Africa in '57. This son Ted was, of course, in accordance with the Sims family traditions and leanings, a soldier likewise—a flourishing young private of the Grey Dragoons, just home from service in South Africa.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305262">They, the Grey Dragoons, were what good Mrs. Sims called 'lying' in Blankhampton Barracks, and naturally Susie saw a good deal of him. But they did not fall in love with each other; I was not leading up to that point, I assure you. But for all that Susie did fall in love; she woke up one fine <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305261" n="493     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/>morning, and found that life was different—life had changed. Love had come into it; Love had brightened and glorified the dingy little attic-room, casting a flood of sunshine over its poor furniture and attempts at decoration, over the poor pictures and cheap plants flowering in the window. Love sat beside her at her meagre breakfast of—never mind what; and Love, the mighty alchemist, transformed it into a very feast of Dives. Love looked back at her from the small square of mildewed glass, before which she made her modest toilette. Love walked with her through the fresh morning air, and bade her open her mouth wide and draw in great breaths of the sharp cold ozone; for the world, after all, in spite of buttonholes and nine shillings a week, is a gay place and worth living in. Love even went so far as to cast his brightness over those everlasting buttonholes, and whisper to her consolingly that scrubbing floors would not only be harder—infinitely harder—work, but would have ruined utterly the little thin white hands, upon which she could yet feel the kisses Love had left upon them a few hours before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305263">And Love had done all this most wonderful transformation. Love, the little wanton boy, who aims his dart at peer and peasant, youth and age alike—Love in one of his most favourite masks, six feet in height—Love in a scarlet jacket, with spurs jingling at his heels—Love with the winning tongue which seems to be the soldier's portion—Love in the guise of a private of Dragoons, with a great hound, over two feet at the shoulder, following at his heels.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305264">There never was such a fine fellow since Adam's day, Adam himself included. If my little needle-driver had been a young lady, with a smattering of a classical education, she would have likened him to a Greek god—say the Apollo; but, then, she was not a young lady, only a little maker of buttonholes, therefore she did not liken Jim Dowcre to anything or anyone, only she poured out upon him all her heart's best treasures, and thought him the grandest picture of a man that she had ever seen.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305266">He was a very fine young man, this Jim, no doubt about it. Fair and tall and straight and strong, with white teeth that gleamed out pretty often from under his trim moustache, with a swaggering gait which seemed the very beau-ideal of utter carelessness, and was, in reality, as studied as the polish of his buttons and his spurs, with a gay, light-hearted manner, and, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305265" n="494     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>as I have said, a winning tongue, which told of Irish sojournings and South African exploits and escapades, with a vividness which did not lose any of its lustre by frequency of repetition—on the contrary; in fact, during the few months that the Grey Dragoons remained in Blankhampton after Jim Dowcre took to walking Susie Harrington out, Susie grew so learned on the subject of mealie-fields, laagers, assegais, outposts, skirmishes, and the like, that she might almost have been born and bred in the service herself. I think it was partly the rapt attention she gave to his yarns which made him spin them out to such a length; who can blame him? What man on earth would not have added to his traveller's tales, when such a little earnest pale face was uplifted to his, such a wee mouth firm-closed, and such a pair of big, dark eyes opening each moment wider and wider, until they seemed at last to swamp the little white face altogether?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305267">'I've put in for leave to be married, Susie,' Jim told her one day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305268">'Have you?' said she in an almost inaudible voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305269">'Yes; you see, we may get our route any day now, and as long as we can get leave, there's nothing to wait for.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305270">'No'—in the very faintest of whispers. 'Very likely, this time next year you'll be in India, Susie,' the soldier went on; then drew for her delight pictures of Indian scenery and life, rather wild as to detail, seeing that they were one and all drawn from South African experiences, but nevertheless quite as fascinating to Susie Harrington's untravelled mind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305271">He did not think it necessary to tell her, in addition to the information that he had put in for leave to be married, the fact that only six per cent. of our army have that permission granted to them, and that he, for certain regimental reasons, was very unlikely to be of the number. No; the route for Colchester arrived in due course, and Jim Dowcre, accompanied by the dog Turk—which, by-the-by, did not belong to him, but to the Captain of his troop—clattered night after night into Blankhampton town, and met his little black-eyed sweetheart under the lime-tree which grew just outside the passage up which she lived. But nothing further was said about the asked-for leave, and in time the Grey Dragoons marched out of Blankhampton Barracks with all the excitement and glory of a military farewell.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305273">Susie had stolen a day from her buttonholes that she might <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305272" n="495     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/>see the very last of her Apollo, and Jim bent down from his saddle to repeat the cheery words of their farewell tune:</p><q><l>'My love, I will come back again</l><l>To the girl I leave behind me.'</l></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305274">'I shall get my leave as soon as the inspection's over,' were his last words; 'and then you'll see me back again, Susie, and we won't never be parted no more.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305275">'Never no more,' repeated Susie solemnly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305276">'And you'll be true to me, Susie; you won't be going with no other chap; you'll be quite true?' he asked anxiously, as anxiously as men always do ask about the truth and constancy of other people.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305277">'I'll be true,' she said; then, trying hard to shake off the emotion which was fast creeping in a great knot up her throat, she asked abruptly, 'Why, where's Turk, Jim?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305278">'Oh, he's hurt his foot a bit. The Capt'n thought he couldn't do the march, so he's coming with the dismounted party.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305279">'Next week?' she asked, feigning an interest she did not feel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305280">'Yes, next week.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305281">Then she fell back, not being able to keep up with the horses any longer. She turned and stood to watch him out of sight, her great eyes swimming with tears.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305282">Suddenly the band changed its tune, and the cheering strains of 'The girl I leave behind me' gave place to the pathetic air of 'You'll remember me.'</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>'When coldness or deceit shall slight</l><l>The beauty now they prize,</l><l>And deem it but a faded light</l><l>Which beams within your eyes:</l><l>When hollow hearts shall wear a mask</l><l>'Twill break your own to see,</l><l>In such a moment I but ask</l><l>That you'll remember me.'</l></lg></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305283">Not very exalted poetry, yet the words—Susie knew them, and the band seemed to really speak them as plainly as a voice—sank deep into her troubled heart. Jim turned in his saddle for the last time, as if silently impressing them upon her. The tears gathered in her eyes, overflowed, and she turned herself back to the dingy little attic which she called home, as sorrowful and desolate a little woman as the world held that day.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305284" n="496     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305285">A week went by. She had on the fourth day a hurried but long letter from Jim, dated from a little country town on the third day of march—a letter that cheered her up and made her feel brave and at peace again. They had had a pleasant march so far, only one mishap—that of a horse which had got loose in its stable, and had so smashed itself that it had to be shot. Poor beast! it had had to lie eight hours in agonies, whilst the officer in command telegraphed to the authorities for permission to destroy it. It made Susie's tender heart ache to read it, but then, you see, she was not a military authority, or she would have known better than to possess a heart to ache at <hi rend="italic">any</hi>thing. I have known a cavalry charger suffering from frightful burns remain <hi rend="italic">three days</hi> before the wise-headed authorities gave permission that it should be put out of its misery, even though the ' vet' in attendance had declared from the very first that nothing else could be done for it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305286">I dare say the gentle and witty critic of the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall Gazette</hi> will, if he happen to review this sketch, again bring forth an exceedingly antiquated joke about the Horse Marines. Believe it or not, it is a positive fact, the date of which is not half a dozen years from the present day.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305287">Well, the letter contained other interesting details: how the farrier-sergeant accompanying Captain Brudenell had, on the second day, coolly gone to bed as soon as they got into their billet, with a bad headache; how the Captain had stormed a bit at first, but had bade them let him sleep himself well again; how Bill Foster had remarked as the Captain went off, 'Lor'! fancy his black face atween two white sheets!' Even the Captain had not been able to help laughing. How, on the same night, Sergeant Haussmann had got roaring drunk, and had hit a civilian over the face with his whip without any provocation whatever; how the Captain had put him under arrest, and had given it him proper into the bargain; how he was safe to be broke for it, and would have but a small chance of ever winning his sergeant's stripes back again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305289">After the receipt of this letter, Susie felt herself again. All the military information delighted her, and she smiled over her buttonholes, looking as blithe and bonny as a bird. Perhaps she smiled most brightly of all over the last piece of information the letter contained—that the incoming regiment, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305288" n="497     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/>the Cherry-pickers, were a queer, wild lot, and she was to be very careful to have nothing to do with any of them.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305290">Sweetest clause! Anything to do with them indeed! As if she, busy with her buttonholes all day, and possessing a Jim Dowcre of her very own, wanted to have anything to do with any Cherry-pickers! She had carefully scrutinized one or two, who had turned up in charge of some hunters, with eyes of utter disfavour, mentally finding fault with their uniform; she voted the crimson overalls as hideous as ridiculous—their air, their gait, looks, everything. She felt the Cherry-pickers were all her enemies, for were they not the supplanters of her beloved Gray Dragoons, who, for Jim's dear sake, she glorified into the smartest regiment in the service, not knowing, poor innocent! that <hi rend="italic">all</hi> cavalry regiments boast of possessing that proud distinction.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305291">Ten days after the departure of headquarters, the dismounted party gave over the barracks into the hands of the dismounted party of the incoming regiment, and turned their backs upon the city of Blankhampton; it was several days after this that Susie Harrington, taking a stroll through the soft summer evening, came upon the dog Turk.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305292">'Why, Turk, old fellow!' she exclaimed, 'they've never left you behind!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305293">' Oh, but they 'ave, miss,' volunteered a smart young Cherry-picker, who had once or twice already cast envious glances oil the girl's big eyes and neat little feet. ' The orficer in charge said he wouldn't 'ave no dorgs with 'im. And one or two of the men said as 'ow it were the Captain's orders (the orficer what owns the dorg, I should say) that the dorg went with the dismounted party. However, the orficer 'ad 'is way, o' course, so the dorg were left—a nasty savage brute he is. If I were you, miss, I wouldn't be so keen of touching him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305294">' Turk—savage!' Susie repeated incredulously. ' Do you think he has had anything to eat?' she asked timidly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305295">' Well, I don't think he 'ave, miss. You see, Capt'n Clarke, as is in command, won't 'ave him in the barracks at all; so I don't think the dorg has fared so very well. I did 'ear Capt'n Clarke say this morning as 'ow he would 'ave him shot.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305296">' Shot!' cried Susie blankly.' Indeed he shall not be shot! I shall take him home with me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305298">' Well, miss, there ain't no one to prevent it; but he's a Savage, surly brute, best kept at a distance, not fit for a <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305297" n="498     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>young lady to 'ave about her. We tried ever so long this morning to get at 'is collar to see the name on it, but he wouldn't let us come nigh hand of 'im.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305299">'Turk, come here,' said Susie in her kind and gentle voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305300">The dog obeyed, and thrust his dejected nose into her hand. She bent down and twisted his collar round, so that the inscription upon it was plainly visible.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305301">'I belong to Captain Brudenell, Grey Dragoons. Whose dog are you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305302">'Good old fellow!' she said, patting his head. 'I'll take him away with me. I have no doubt he'll be sent for as soon as the Captain finds out they have left him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305303">The dog, having once more licked her hand, had gone into the middle of the road and lain down there, looking with his deep-sunken eyes wistfully into the barrack-square, which until then had been his home. Poor beast! it was hard for him to understand that, though the barrack was there still, the rough and kindly voices which had greeted him with many a caressing word were there no longer; that the doors of the troop-rooms, which until then had always opened at the heavy thump of his tail, the scratch of his big paw, or the deep 'wough, wough' of his voice, were closed to him for ever. You have felt yourself in just that position, reader, have you not? Then you can not only sympathize with Turk, who was thus suddenly cast upon a world which was neither kind nor tender to him, but you can perhaps understand also something of the wistful amazement which must have filled his faithful dog's heart. Susie Harrington understood it to a nicety; poor little woman! it was perhaps something of a fellow-feeling which made her so wondrous kind to a friendless dog.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305304">As she stood there, hearing without heeding the young trooper's awkward and florid compliments, a small car, drawn by a skewbald cob pony, and containing two officers in plain clothes, approached from the town; the dog was lying directly in their path.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305306">For a moment Susie thought the driver meant to run over him, but, though he did turn the skewbald slightly on one side, he could not yet pass the poor desolate animal in peace, but caught him a smart cut with his whip as he lay on the ground. Turk gave a dismal howl, and the two soldiers <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305305" n="499     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/>laughed, turning more than admiring glances on Susie's dark eyes as they passed her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305307">Susie rushed right into the middle of the road, her eyes blazing, her face pale no longer, but streaked with an angry scarlet flush.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305308">'You—you—you brute!' she cried, clenching her little, thin, white hand into a fist. 'You—you—you <hi rend="italic">coward!</hi>' and then she burst out crying over Turk's great cowering body.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305310">From that hour the Blankhampton Barracks knew Turk no more; he went home with Susie Harrington to the dingy little attic up Barker's Passage, and became her dear companion and friend. Dear in more senses than one; for first she had to take out a license, lest the police should be down upon her, and prove even harder of heart towards Turk than the Cherry-pickers had been. She had to go on short commons that week, for Turk had to be fed, and the seven-and-sixpence for the license had been a good slice to take out of a weekly wage of nine shillings. But Susie did not mind; it cost her, it is true, many a sacrifice to have the keep of a huge hound thrust upon her, but she made the sacrifices cheerfully; certainly she gave Turk enough to eat, even if at times she went on scanty fare herself. It was not any fault of the poor dumb beast that he had been left behind, and the girl was too just and generous to let him suffer. It is true, also, that in those days of loneliness he was a comfort to her—a very great comfort. He was something to care for, something to think about; she took him for a run every morning before she went to her buttonholes, and again when she had done with them for the day; for the rest, he remained waiting for her within the precincts of Barker's Passage. People wondered that he did so, that he never ventured outside into the street and strayed away as other dogs will do; but Turk never did. It may be that he had a wholesome horror of crimson overalls, and preferred to remain in what he knew was safety; I cannot say. Who shall tell the workings of a dog's mind? I only know that Turk, who had never been of a buoyant nature, though to those whom he knew well always intensely affectionate, became the most patiently miserable and mournfully dejected of dogs. Sometimes Susie used to wonder what he could be thinking of. That the dog <hi rend="italic">was</hi> thinking, she never doubted for an instant. At the sound of a strange footstep he would raise his great head, prick up his heavy ears, and
<pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305309" n="500     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>thump his tail upon the floor in joyful expectation; but no! the master he waited for did not come, the step was not his—down would drop the head upon his paws, the expectant ears droop, the tail fall to the floor in a final thump, which meant disappointment, if ever a dog's tail meant it in this world.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305311">Then Susie, who knew all that was troubling him, would pet and make much of him, and try to make him understand the truth—that Captain Brudenell was away from his regiment ill, having had the misfortune to break his leg on the march, and believed Turk was safe and sound in Colchester Barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305312">' He'll send for you, Turk, old boy,' she cried one night. ' Jim'll tell him as soon as he rejoins; and till then, you must just put up with Susie, who loves you dearly, because you belong to her own Grey Dragoons.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305313">But Turk did not understand; he knew that Susie loved him, and in his turn he loved her dearly. But Susie was not Captain Brudenell, and Susie was not Jim Dowcre. For all his five years of life he had been the constant and daily companion of those two—of the officer in the daytime, of the trooper during the evening. He had been out to South Africa, and present at Ulundi; he had known many changes, suffered many fatigues, but he had never known the change of a master; and with all his fatigues, he had never before endured that of living in an attic up Barker's Passage.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305314">Again Susie had heard from Jim—the letter in which he told her of the accident to his Captain. He asked her to keep the dog until he should be sent for.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305315">Then there came a long silence. Twice the girl wrote, but there was no reply. She did not write again; even if she was only a poor little woman who made nothing but buttonholes, she was very proud. Besides, she had very little time; the poor do not scrawl off letters by the dozen as we do, and perhaps they do not look for them as eagerly. Any way, she did not write again</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305317">So the summer slipped by. Then, at the beginning of September, there did come a letter, a mere scrawl; they had been ' orfully' hard-worked, but the inspection was over, and he had been made a corporal. As for the dog, he had told Captain Brudenell, who had been very angry indeed, declaring he had been left behind simply to annoy him; he was very much obliged (Captain Brudenell, that is) to her for taking <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305316" n="501     A LITTLE DRESSMAKER"/>care of him, and as he would be in Blankhampton in the course of a few weeks, he would fetch him away himself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305318"><hi rend="italic">There was not a word of Jim's own return!</hi></p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305319">Not that the girl noticed it—she was far too happy to read between the lines and see that he did not mean to come at all. She was so happy. She even went the length of reading the letter to Turk, who licked her hand, and made a feeble, lifeless, spiritless kind of Hop to reach her face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305320">'They are coming back, my honey,' she told him gaily. 'And then you and I'll be as happy as we've never been in all our lives before;' at which Turk banged his tail upon the floor. There was no doubt Turk loved her very dearly, if not quite the most dearly of the whole world.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305321">'Give me a throw of the cup, Mrs. Sims,' she said that evening, breaking in upon the soldier's widow, followed by the big hound.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305322">It was much the same as usual: a tall, fair man, serving under the Crown—a journey between them—a letter—a ring—a surprise, and so on. If Mrs. Sims foresaw anything more, she kept her foresight to herself. And then she got to talking of her Crimean experiences again, and her political views; Susie's hair had long since given up standing on end for political causes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305323">'I'm a plain woman of no education,' Mrs. Sims asserted, 'but I haven't forgot how men died in the trenches like sheep, and in the hospitals worse than sheep in a slaughter-house, while them at home was talking of the glory. Ay, my bairn, you'd better have chosen anything but a soldier lad; it's but a poor and a hard lot, and, remember, you wasn't born and bred to it like me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305324">Ah! but Susie was in love—Mrs. Sims had forgotten that.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305325">It might be that she had had a hint of what was coming from her boy Ted which made the soldier's widow all at once take such a warning tone to Susie; it may be that she really did see something at the bottom of a teacup. Any way, one Saturday evening at the end of the month of September, she knocked at her window as Susie passed from her work. Susie went in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305326">'Susie Harrington,' said the soldier's widow sorrowfully, 'I've news for you. I've had a letter from our Ted.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305327">'From your Ted?' said Susie, turning very white.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305329">'Never you heed, my girl,' the other went on in tones of <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305328" n="502     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>stern comfort. 'I've seen it coming, though I hadn't the heart for to mention it, lest I might be wrong. He's a bad scoundrel as ever drew breath; I wish I'd never set eyes on him, let alone ha' got you to be sweethearts.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305330">'What is it?' Susie panted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305331">'He's married another woman, my girl,' said the widow pitifully. 'It's a way soldiers have, 'specially when there's money in the case. Our Ted says she's a fond, brazant thing, but she'd fifty pounds that her master left her for a legacy. It's the fifty pounds, my girl, he's left you for, not for her'—with a rough attempt at consolation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305332">'I'll go home,' said Susie quietly; 'I'll go home, Mrs. Sims; good-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305333">Yes, she would go home to her lonely attic and to Turk; there she would find solitude, quietness and peace.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305334">Poor dear little sewer of buttonholes! she went through the narrow, dingy streets like a woman in a dream. Jim had married another woman for fifty pounds—that was the burden of her thoughts—for fifty pounds.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305335">'We won't never be parted no more,' the words rang in her ears still—the words he had spoken so earnestly when he left her. Poor innocent little darling! so many men say them, and so many women believe them—she was but one of a multitude.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305336">She passed under the lime-tree and turned down the narrow passage leading to her home.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305337">'Susie Harrington,' said a voice from the kitchen of the house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305338">'Yes, Mrs. Smith,' she answered wearily. 'What is it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305339">'There's been a gentleman here for you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305340">'A gentleman for me!' Her heart gave a great leap of joy.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305341">'Yes, a real gentleman—no end of a swell,' the landlady answered. 'He came for the dog.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305342">'<hi rend="italic">The—dog!</hi>' The words seemed to come from somewhere a long way off, not from Susie Harrington at all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305343">'Ay, he left this note for you.

Alone in her attic she opened the letter; it contained two five-pound notes and the following written on a sheet of crested paper:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305348">'Captain Brudenell wishes to thank Miss S. Harrington for her kindness in taking care of his dog. He hopes she will accept the enclosed as a small return for all her trouble.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305349">A small return, when he had taken away the only thing she had to love! Oh, the mockery those two flimsy bits of paper seemed to her! Jim had married another woman for fifty pounds, and Turk had utterly forgotten her at the sight of his own master!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305350">I think almost she felt the one desertion as keenly as the other, for she sank down on her little bed, hiding her face upon her hands, with one word thrice repeated on her lips:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305351">'Turk!

E. T.'s French, his grammar, or his pomposity.—ED</note>—James Enoch Tankerville, Lieutenant Tankerville, 1st South-West Royal Chalkshire Rifle Volunteers, at your service.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305353">I am a widower. Indeed, I may say I am a double-distilled widower, for poor Carrie was the second devoted wife whose loss I mourned—at least, Carrie was very devoted wife whose loss I mourned—at least, Carrie was very devoted; I don't know whether I can say as much for Rosa. But never mind Rosa—Rosa was, so to speak, a Tartar, and it was a real stroke of ill-luck that I happened to catch her. Without doubt Carrie was all that could be desired. Submissive—she never said 'no' to anything <hi rend="italic">I</hi> said; economical—I never bought her a frock all the years we were married; clever—she played and sang splendidly, and spoke French like a native; and what was more, she was always at all times a perfect lady. Ah, well, well! I only trust Loo may prove as entirely satisfactory when, my term of mourning having expired, I lead her to the Hymeneal altar to become Mrs. James Enoch Tankerville, in lieu of being simply Miss Talbot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305354">Apropos of names and titles, I do wish Loo were a trifle less flippant; I dislike flippancy extremely, especially in a woman,</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305355" n="504     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305356">more especially in a young woman. Now, it was only as far back as yesterday that I just hinted—in the most delicate manner imaginable, of course, for it is but four months since I became a widower for the second time—well, I just hinted that Mrs. <hi rend="italic">Tankerville</hi> would be a vast improvement on Miss <hi rend="italic">Talbot</hi>, when Loo called out, in her particularly aggravating straightforward way: ' Oh!
<q><l>'"Change the name and not the letter,</l><l>Change for the worse and not the better."'</l></q>
I felt, somehow, as if I had had a cold shock. It is very ridiculous of Loo to be for ever pretending she does not care whether she makes the most of her chances of entering into the bonds of holy matrimony or no—as if <hi rend="italic">all</hi> women do not prefer double to single harness. I know what it all means. There is a bygone romance in Loo's life—a big dragoon—a regiment ordered to India—a parting, and what is romantically called ' a broken heart.' I know all about it. I am <hi rend="italic">like</hi> to, as the Chalkshire people say; for Loo, as it were, thrusts the old love-affair down my throat on every conceivable occasion and in every imaginable way: she does it with an air of defiance, which renders mistake impossible. For instance, not many days ago, in speaking of a little family disagreement of my own, which also included her, I said:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305357">'Ah, well, never mind, Loo; don't take any notice.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305358">Said Loo, with a wistful look in her great eyes, and I'll swear what was half a sob rising in her throat:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305359">'I don't like making gaps.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305360">Said I airily: 'Oh, fill your gaps up again;' and I must confess I was thinking more of the big dragoon than I was of my own people.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305361">Loo turned upon me almost savagely, with what looked like tears in her big eyes and what sounded like tears in her voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305362">'You may fill your gaps up again, Mr. Tankerville,' she said passionately, ' but I shall <hi rend="italic">never</hi> fill mine'—and I think she added, ' <hi rend="italic">with you</hi>,' only it seems too absurd on the face of it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305363">And yet it was only last week, by way of ignoring the very considerable difference in our ages—she is three-and-twenty, I on the wrong side of fifty—that I chanced to observe, quite casually, of course, that I thought she looked more than her age.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305364">'I've had such troubles,' she answered, quite gravely for her. 'And, faith! they do take the shine out of one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305366">'Oh!' I said, smiling. I wanted to put aside that old <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305365" n="505     LOO"/>romance, so spoke lightly. 'You carry your troubles well; you seem to forget them very comfortably.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305367">Loo opened her eyes. She has a somewhat objectionable manner of suddenly raising her eyelids.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305368">'There are <hi rend="italic">some</hi> troubles, Mr. Tankerville, that I have no desire to forget.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305369">She spoke in a tone of dignified significance, and I knew she was thinking of that fellow in India. What she could ever see in him <hi rend="italic">to admire</hi>, I cannot imagine. A great coarse, hulking brute, six feet high, with nothing of the slender elegance for which I am remarkable—a man with a hand like a leg of mutton, as ready to knock you down as look at you. But Loo seems to admire that gross type. Now, for my part, I consider that beauty consists not in immensity of size, but in exquisite proportion. All the Tankervilles are elegant—markedly so. My sister, Mrs. Pergolesi Stubbins, is a very elegant woman—not a large woman by any means. None of the Tankervilles are large, but slim, graceful, slender, with a fine fall in the shoulders, though, I must confess it, a total absence of those fine curves for which Loo is distinguished.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305370">Loo is a fine young woman—not handsome. Indeed, the most noticeable part of her face are two big brown eyes, with black eyelashes and eyebrows, the latter well defined. But Loo is tall—slightly taller, in truth, than myself; and Loo has a figure which is small in the waist and full in the bust—in short, what our Gaulic neighbours describe as <hi rend="italic">swelte</hi>. No, that can't be right; there isn't a<hi rend="italic">w</hi> in French; I'll look it out. Ah, yes, <hi rend="italic">svelte</hi>, and that is what describes Loo precisely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305371">As I said, slender elegance seems to have no charms for her; if a long-legged, square-shouldered, swaggering dragoon—a common soldier, I mean, not an officer—passes us in the High Street, or in the Winter Garden, Loo puts her head on one side, and cries in her absurdly impulsive way, 'Oh, <hi rend="italic">isn't</hi> he a fine fellow!' For my part, I must say I am of the old-fashioned way of thinking, which decreed that a lady should be absolutely unaware of the person of any man until he has paid her some attentions; while of the physique of a man of the social status of a common soldier, she should remain once and for all in utter ignorance. But Loo is of the new school, and I am afraid she has had a lax bringing up, as I had ample opportunity of perceiving the other day, when I spoke in favour of the old-fashioned ideas.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305372" n="506     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305373">'Handsome fellow!' she exclaimed, following a fair-haired long-legged officer with her big eyes. 'Just the type of man I most admire. Oh, I <hi rend="italic">beg</hi> your pardon, Mr. Tankerville, <hi rend="italic">what</hi> did you say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305374">I did not condescend to repeat it. I said it was not worth it. Loo said coolly she dared say not. I believe she tries how far my self-command will carry me, when she makes those daring little speches of hers; or perhaps the little puss is only trying to force my hand, for the man in question was as utterly unlike me as one human being can be like another. Ah, well, well, I will fall in with her humour—it will only be for a time: I must make a merit of stooping to conquer; little matters of that kind may all stand over until, my term of mourning having expired, Loo becomes mine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305375">I am sorry to say, though, that Loo has various ideas which I must by-and-by endeavour to eradicate. For instance, I happened to express an opinion the other day that a man should have complete control, not merely over his wife's actions, but also over her ideas. Loo's views are different.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305376">'Why should a woman be any man's slave?' she cried. 'I can tell you, if any man ever tries to reduce <hi rend="italic">me</hi>'—and Loo has a particularly disagreeable way of emphasizing her remarks—'to subjection, I shall simply throw something at his <hi rend="italic">head</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305377">Imagine Loo throwing something or anything at me! <hi rend="italic">Entre nous</hi>, I can imagine nothing more readily—in her present rebellious state, that is. But I must be firm. I must begin as I mean to go on, for if there is one point more than another upon which I am inflexible, it is that I shall be the master, most emphatically the master, of my own house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305379">'Pooh!' Loo cried, when I expressed myself somewhat warmly on the subject of a mutual friend who is thoroughly henpecked, 'only mean men and noodles trouble themselves to be anything of the kind. Now I'll tell you, Mr. Tankerville, what is my beau-ideal of a man and a husband. A man and a husband, Mr. Tankerville, whether he be a nobleman or a cottar, may reasonably expect that he shall have a good dinner every day—good, that is, according to his position in life. If his dinner is not forthcoming, that man may make row; I don't mean just a growl in a mild kind of way, but a regular shindy. Otherwise, a man has nothing to do with his household whatever, except in providing his wife with so much <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305378" n="507     LOO"/>money each week, or each month or quarter, as the case may be. With the ins and outs of housekeeping, a man has no business to have even an acquaintance, to say nothing of a real intimacy.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305380">All very well, but that won't do for <hi rend="italic">me;</hi> I must and will be the master of my own house.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305381">'Only a mean-spirited creature, who is nobody <hi rend="italic">out</hi> of his house,' says Loo, 'would give a fig to be anyone <hi rend="italic">in</hi> it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305382">Does Loo mean to imply, I wonder, that <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am a mean-spirited creature?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305383">'Now, when <hi rend="italic">I</hi>get married,' Loo remarked yesterday, 'I'll tell you what I mean to do, Mr. Tankerville: I mean to be master and mistress both.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305384">'When you get married,' I returned with a quiet smile, 'you will do as all other ladies do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305385">'Shall I? Ah, I don't think so,' she retorted. 'I don't think, though, that I ever shall marry. Marry! Why should I? To have the unspeakable honour of being called 'Mrs.' instead of ' Miss'? After all, what is it that we women gain by marriage? Don't you know that a great man once said, "There is no slavery like that of a white slave who wears a wedding-ring"? He was quite right. We lose our liberty, our individuality; we become slaves, mere slaves. Why, look at me now. I go out when I like; I go in when I like. I go where I like and how I like; I spend what I like; I've no one to grumble at my dressmaker's bill or any other bills. My mother'—Loo has a stand-offish way of saying 'me môth-aw,' which is very objectionable—'never interferes with me nor I with her. Sometimes they send in the bills to me, sometimes to her: sometimes they give us one between us. I should take badly to having to keep a <hi rend="italic">man</hi> in good temper all day long; and, after all, what should I gain?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305386">'Do you think nothing of—love?' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305387">Loo's big eyes softened. 'Ah, yes! if I could gain—love.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305388">I saw an opportunity for improving the occasion. A word in season, how good it is!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305390">'My dear late wife,' I said in quavering accents, 'was, I believe, perfectly happy. Why she was taken away from me I could not at first imagine. She lived in what to her was a terrestrial paradise; she often said so. Perhaps we were too nappy in each other's love; I cannot say.' And here I sighed. 'Yet, with her birds and her dogs, her flowers and her—her <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305389" n="508     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>husband, she was truly content. I do assure you we had but one heart, one soul, one mind——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305391">'<hi rend="italic">Your</hi> mind, I suppose?' Loo put in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305392">I felt startled. I admit it. 'We never,' I said, with dignity—'we never had a disagreement.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305393">'Oh, hadn't you? Dear me, how gossip does gather about people! Now, I always understood you fought like cat and dog,' remarked Loo, with a flippancy which I must say astonished me. 'Well, Mr. Tankerville, all I can say is, that when I—if I ever am so foolish as to marry, I shall take care to choose a man big enough to break my neck with one twist of his finger and thumb; he'll be above any master-of-his-own-house rubbish, and will let me have a mind, and a soul, and a heart, and all that, to myself;' at which Mrs. Talbot had the bad taste to laugh outright.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305394">I am beginning to think that Loo's terrible straightforwardness very frequently leads her into vulgarity, and, instead of repressing it, Mrs. Talbot only encourages her in it. I don't like Mrs. Talbot, somehow; she is one of your hatefully cool, clever women. However, when Loo becomes the mistress of Ullathorne House, I shall take care to keep her mother at a respectful distance. A mother-in-law with a persistent habit of placing herself exactly on a level with one—as regards age, that is (I must do Mrs. Talbot the justice to say that she never classes herself with me in other respects)—and speaking of Loo as if she is a child of ten years old, would scarcely be an agreeable visitor. Besides, she invariably makes Loo laugh: 'Why, I'm <hi rend="italic">three</hi>-and -twenty,' as if that was the age of Methuselah.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_246" n="2" type="episode"><head>EPISODE II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305395">THEY are going away! I saw them in the Winter Garden this evening, and <hi rend="italic">Loo let it slip</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305396">I couldn't shut my eyes to that, for Mrs. Talbot frowned at Loo, and Loo said, 'Oh, I forgot,' and turned her attention resolutely to the Dragoon band which occupied the orchestra at that moment. They were playing 'The Blue Danube.' I touched Loo's arm.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305397">'Do you remember our ball?' I asked, referring to a grand ball given by the officers of the 1st South-West Royal Chalk-shire Rifle Volunteers two years previously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305399">'I should think I do,' Loo answered, beating time to the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305398" n="509     LOO"/>music. 'It was the happiest—at least, one of the happiest—evenings of my life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305400">'Do you remember the waltz?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305401">'"The Blue Danube"?' Oh yes. I danced it with Dicky Treherne—always kept "The Blue Danube" for Dicky—such a pleasant step he had!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305402">Loo danced it with <hi rend="italic">me!</hi> I remember it distinctly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305403">'Don't you remember dancing with <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305404">'Oh yes—rather! You dance deux-temps.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305405">Written down, the words look nothing. I do dance deux-temps—but spoken as Loo spoke them they conveyed an idea of disparaging contempt which made me boil. But it was not convenient that I should show displeasure. I therefore changed the conversation abruptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305406">'And so you are going to Bruxelles?' I remarked as pleasantly as I could.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305407">'Oh no!' Loo replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305408">'You certainly said so,' I told her decidedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305409">'I beg your pardon,' she answered, with a laugh. 'I told you we were going to Brussels.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305410">'And when are you going?' I thought it wisest to ignore the remark, annoying as it was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305411">'Monday.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305412">'And how long are you intending to remain?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305413">'As long as our money lasts,' she returns coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305414">I could not very well ask how much money they meant to take with them, so I passed over that remark likewise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305415">'And what hotels do you go to?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305416">'Lodgings,' said Loo tersely, and without turning her head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305417">'Oh, you'd much better go to a <hi rend="italic">pensiong</hi>, I suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305418">'I should think we had better please ourselves,' she replied absently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305419">'And when do you <hi rend="italic">think</hi> you'll be back?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305420">'Oh, for Christmas, certain.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305421">'Christ—mas, and it is now July! You will let me write to you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305422">'Write to me, Mr. Tankerville!' Loo exclaimed, opening her eyes as if she never meant to shut them any more. 'And what do you want to write to me about?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305423">'What about? Why, just to let you know how things are going on—how everyone is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305424">' My dear Mr. Tankerville, I don't want to know!' she cried.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305425" n="510     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305426">'I dislike Garthhampton so thoroughly that, if I could help it I would never set foot in the place again. Unfortunately, Mrs. Talbot will be obliged to return.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305427">'Why do you dislike it?' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305428">'Why?'—with a great sigh. 'Oh, I've been unhappy and miserable here, and I never feel quite well. I always have a sense of suffocation just here '—laying her hand for an instant on her heart. 'I hate Garthhampton!' And she said it as if she meant it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305429">'My dear,' put in Mrs. Talbot quietly, 'would you not like to go? The Scottish Fantasia comes next.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305430">'Oh yes, mother darling, please!' Loo exclaimed, rising from her chair with alacrity. ' Let us get out before it begins. I can't bear it,' she said, turning to me.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305431">'Why?' I asked curiously. But Loo did not reply—in fact, as we left the building, I felt obliged to offer my arm to her mother, who is a little lame.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305432">'Pray take my arm, Mrs. Talbot,' I said as genially as I could.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305433">'Oh, thank you,' she returned frigidly, 'but I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> my stick.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305434">Did she mean to compare me to a stick? If not, why, then, did Loo and her aunt, Miss Graves, both laugh?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305435">As Mrs. Talbot and her sister walked together, I fell into the rear with Loo.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305436">'You won't be here for our review?' I observed in disappointed tones.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305437">' Your review! What is that?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305438">'Our review—the review on the first of August (by General Frothingham) of our regiment,' I explained.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305439">'Your <hi rend="italic">regiment!</hi>' Loo repeated. 'Do you mean the volunteer corps?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305440">'Yes. I had quite made up my mind you would come to it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305441">'You should never make up your mind about anything that concerns the movements of other people, Mr. Tankerville,' Loo said coolly. 'If I were in Garthhampton, I shouldn't think of going to see volunteers. You see, I've known so much of the real thing. How awfully glad you'll be when it's over!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305442">'Oh no!' I disclaimed. 'I shall be very sorry indeed. I really enjoy the work.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305443">'How extra-ordinary!' Loo laughed. 'Mother dear, what do you think? Mr. Tankerville says he actually enjoys working up for inspection!'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305444" n="511     LOO"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305445">"Review', I corrected gently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305446">'Oh yes—review, I suppose you call it. You see, we have been accustomed to hear such grumbling and growling and moaning at the mere prospect of an inspection, that it seems odd to hear of anyone enjoying it—"If only this horrible inspection were over!" and the like.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305447">'We are working very hard,' I told her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305448">'Are you, though? Yes, I see you pass sometimes in what I suppose you call your uniform', she said carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305449">What I <hi rend="italic">call</hi> my uniform!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305450">'Then you won't remain for it?' I asked, keeping calm by an immense effort.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305451">'Oh no. Besides, George—my brother, you know—meets us in town on Tuesday. He is going with us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305452">'Really—I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> glad!' I exclaimed. 'I had been wondering how you would manage with your luggage and the Custom House, and all that.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305453">'Oh dear, Mr. Tankerville,' put in Mrs. Talbot in her frigid way, 'I assure you we are very capable women.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305454">'Rather,' Loo laughed. 'George just leaves it all to me, and I go and make eyes at the <hi rend="italic">douaniers;</hi> and the luggage is passed before you can say "Knife." '</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305455">Positively Loo sometimes takes my breath away.

'Oh, I assure you some of them are awfully good-looking, and they're all awfully susceptible.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305458">I turned away in silence, merely kissing my hand by way of saying good-night, we having reached their house. Unfortunately, I ran full bang against the wall of the opposite house, and nearly broke my nose. It was a startling and sad finale to a tender and idyllic farewell. I felt it at the time. As for Loo, she shut the door quickly, and just roared. I stayed long enough to hear that.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_247" n="3" type="episode"><head>EPISODE III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305460">LA BRUXELLES! Paris in miniature!

As I told Loo once in speaking of a man who had accepted a half-refusal, 'A man's not to be shaken off like that if he's one of the right sort and means anything.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305464">Loo said, 'Oh!' That's a habit of hers—one I don't like.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305465">Speaking of angels, you'll hear their wings; and there is Loo, with her mother, just crossing the Place towards the Montague de la Cour. I will go after them, casually, and with a cigar, as if the meeting is one of pure accident.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305466">'How do you do, Mrs. Talbot?' I said; she and Loo were looking in the window of a jeweller's shop.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305467">Mrs. Talbot started visibly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305468">'Oh, is that <hi rend="italic">you?</hi>' she remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305469">I replied pleasantly that I was myself, and asked if I might have the pleasure of calling upon them at their appartement.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305470">'Oh yes, come round to our <hi rend="italic">lodgings</hi> any time,' Loo said cheerfully—evidently she is not sorry I have given her this proof of my devotion—' Rue du Prince Royal, 42.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305471">'And how shall I find the Roo doo Pwinz Woy-al?' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305472">'Rue du Prince Royal,' she repeated. Somehow she made the words sound quite different. 'Oh, take the tram to Porte Louise, and anyone will tell you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305473">All very fine that! I never have any difficulty in making myself understood. I just pound away at my French. No; what difficulty I have to contend with is in making out the answers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305474">'Turn up the street to the left, instead of going along the Avenue Louise, and you <hi rend="italic">can't</hi> get wrong,' Loo added, seeing, no doubt, that I looked puzzled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305475">Well, well, as to the means by which I found my <hi rend="italic">n'importe</hi>. Suffice it to say that I did find the house. knocked; I rang. A lady opened the door.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305476" n="513     LOO"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305477">'Mademoi—at least, Madame Talbot—er—er—est—elle—er—umph—er——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305478">'Mrs. Talbot is at home, sir,' returned the young lady in perfect English. 'This way.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305479">She was an uncommonly good-looking girl, no doubt about that, and her English was charming, having just the faintest <hi rend="italic">soupçon</hi> of a foreign accent. She led me into a room almost lined with looking-glass, with a monster crystal chandelier in the centre of it, big enough for a ballroom. The walls were panelled with stamped green and mulberry-coloured cloth, having a high dado of dark wood, defined by a narrow gilt line. The furniture was of rosewood and green velvet; there was a superb piano, curtains of whitest lace, flowers, plants, china. I must confess it, that room fairly took my breath away. I wonder how much they pay for it?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305480">I heard Loo's laugh on the stairs—I could swear to her laugh anywhere—echoed a moment later by a man's deeper bass. I only caught a word or two of what she said; it was in French, and rendered less easy to hear by her laughter. What I did catch was something about 'les braves Belges,' and 'la bataille de Waterloo.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305481">Then followed an eager protest in the man's deeper tones:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305482">'Non, non, non, ma'moiselle; juste an contraire.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305483">Then Loo laughed again, and, laughing, entered the room. She had her hat on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305484">'How d'you do?' she said carelessly, seating herself. 'Jolly weather, isn't it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305485">'Charming,' I returned. 'And how's mamma after her walk?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305486">'Mam-ma,' Loo repeated. 'Do you mean me môth-aw?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305487">'Er—yes,' I answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305488">'Oh, she'll be down directly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305489">'You are going out?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305490">'Yes. Oh, I say, Mr. Tankerville, that passion-flower you sent the morning we left home was a regular humbug; it never closed at all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305491">And I had staked my life on that flower closing up exactly four-and-twenty hours after it was cut. Just like my luck.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305492">'And George and I went to the Wiertz Museum—awfully disappointed we were, too—regular claptraps and sell it was.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305494">My confounded luck again I don't know much of art, I admit it, but I had described the Wiertz Musée very graphically to her, dwelling particularly on 'The Rosebud,' and <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305493" n="514     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>'Hunger, Madness and Crime.' Carrie always declared they were rubbish, though I insisted they were not; it was one of the few times that Carrie allowed her opinion to run contrary to mine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305495">Now, it happened that, whilst in town on my way hither, I met with an artist of some note who quite took Carrie's view; as I said, just like my luck.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305496">'Yes; George was disgusted,' Loo went on. 'I didn't like them, but, then, I don't go in for art as he does.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305497">'Did Mrs. Talbot go?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305498">'Oh no; she's not to be drawn into horrors. We are going down this afternoon to the big museum. The old pictures are mostly rather horrible, we think, but the modern side has some charming things. Oh, here she is.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305499">I expressed myself delighted to have an opportunity of escorting the ladies to the Musée.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305500">'Oh, we don't want an escort!' Loo laughed. 'We just lark about by ourselves very comfortably. All the same, you can come if you like. Will you take anything, though? We can offer you some Gruyère cheese and biscuits, or a cognac and siphon.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305501">I declined in haste. Was she trying to shock me? It is not unlikely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305502">'Then, let us go,' said Mrs. Talbot, an odd smile lurking about the corners of her mouth. By-the-by, I wonder what that smile meant. Some diablerie, of course.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305503">On our way out we passed the open door of a sitting-room, through which I caught a glimpse of a man, young, big—six feet in height at least.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305504">'Have you the house to yourselves?' I asked, taking note of Loo's smiling gesture of farewell as we passed the window.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305505">'Some Irish people up above, of whom we have not made friends,' Mrs. Talbot answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305506">'Was that a daughter of the house who let me in?' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305507">'Yes; there are three—such charming girls.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305508">'And one charming son,' inserted Loo, with the utmost coolness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305509">I felt the blood rising to my face, but I kept silent.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305511">'I chaff him tremendously about Waterloo,' she continue 'I tell him the Belgians all ran away, declaring the English were beaten, and that the French were advancing on Brussels. His "Non, non, non, ma'moiselle," is the most amusing thing <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305510" n="515     LOO"/>in the world. By-the-bye, mother dearie, I wanted to call at the boot-shop in the Chaussée d'Ixelles.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305512">'We can come back that way,' Mrs. Talbot replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305513">'Very well.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305514">'Can you go both by the Porte Louise and the Chaussée d'Iselles?' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305515">'Yes; but Louise is a little nearer than the Chaussée d'lxelles.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305516">Now, everyone knows that the <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is silent in French—per example, dix-huit.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305517">'I know you'll forgive me; but should you not say d'lselles?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305518">I was really unable to contain myself any longer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305519">'Ixelles, Mr. Tankerville.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305520">'Are you sure?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305521">'Quite sure.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305522">'But, nevertheless, I think you are wrong—" Dixelles." It must mean, or have meant originally, ten girls—we say dix-huit.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305523">'Don't know what it means. They all pronounce it x about here, and I suppose they ought to know,' Loo answered with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305524">'I feel absolutely certain you are wrong,' I persisted gently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305525">'Oh! bet and have done with it. I don't mind laying a fiver.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305526">Of course I couldn't do that; why, I might have lost. I offered to take the bet in gloves. Loo declined; she said Brussels gloves were not worth buying. I remember telling her how super-excellent were the ganteries de Bruxelles; but when she held out a <hi rend="italic">very</hi> shabby hand, all holes and darns, and said she hadn't had them a week—why, I wished I had let the glove question alone. At this moment it occurred to me that it would be as well to start another subject.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305527">'Been to the Wauxhall?' I asked, as we reached the tram-station.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305528">'I didn't know there was one,' Loo exclaimed. 'Shall we go, mother?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305529">'If you like, dear,' her mother answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305530">'I shall be delighted to escort you,' I said gallantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305531">'Oh, you're awfully kind, but we don't <hi rend="italic">need</hi> an escort,' Loo cried daringly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305532">'It is not a place to which ladies can go alone.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305533">'English ladies can go anywhere alone,' Loo retorted. 'Ah, here's the tram.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305534" n="516     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305535">Presently the conductor came.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305536">'Quelle place?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305537">I was obliged to look to Loo for instructions.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305538">'Place Royal—deux,' she said, holding out a franc.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305539">'I will pay,' I whispered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305540">'Oh, nonsense!'—holding out the money and taking the tickets. 'It is not likely we should allow you to pay for us.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305541">'But when I am taking ladies anywhere I am accustomed to pay for them,' I remonstrated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305542">'You are not <hi rend="italic">taking</hi> us anywhere, Mr. Tankerville,' she answered, with an air of unnecessary hauteur, at which her mother laughed aloud. 'And we are not the kind of ladies for whom men are accustomed to pay.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305543">I was glad to change the subject. Loo's voice is clear and high-pitched; and there are so many English loafing about Brussels.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305544">That was the beginning of a battle-royal between Loo and myself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305545">'To tell you the truth,' I said jokingly one day, 'I like standing Sam.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305546">Loo's face turned to absolute stone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305547">'I'm sure I don't know what <hi rend="italic">standing Sam</hi> is, Mr. Tankerville, unless it is that you like paying money for other people; but you seem to forget that me môth-aw and myself are not a couple of housemaids out for an airing.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305548">We were just getting into the tram as she spoke. She and 'me 
môth-aw' sat together on the bench third from the driver; I, there being no room, on the one immediately behind them. Beside me were two young officers in uniform.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305549">'Pray, do let me pay,' I whispered. 'It must look so odd to the officials, and we can settle up afterwards;' of course, having no such intention.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305550">Loo turned upon me like a fury.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305551">'Really, Mr. Tankerville,' she exclaimed in her high tones, 'why should you have the honour and glory of paying for us—with our money, too?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305552">That was a facer; and the worst of it all was, that the two young puppies in the beggarly uniform of the Sapeur-Pompiers, evidently understanding English, burst out laughing, and laughed immoderately all the way to Place Royal. I should like to box that young woman's ears. She will try me too far one of these days; I feel convinced of it.</p></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305553" n="517     LOO"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_251" n="4" type="episode"><head>EPISODE IV.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305554">I HAD every reason, when I first began to pay Loo any attention, to believe that at no very distant date she would be very well off. She is the only child, she and her brother, of course—and, by-the-by, I may mention that he returned to England before I left it—of a large and elderly family of rich people. Not that Loo ever said anything to me on that point, always declaring herself as being, and likely to be, as poor as a rat. But I knew a little of Loo's family, and put two and two very neatly together in my own mind; though, to be sure, I couldn't estimate to a thousand or two what might be the extent of her fortune, and it was a question I was scarcely in a position to ask. Still, I was sure she would be an excellent <hi rend="italic">parti</hi>. She is undoubtedly a perfect lady, if at times rather brusque and plain of speech. She has an attractive appearance, and, if not handsome, is what the Italians call <hi rend="italic">distinto;</hi> dances beautifully, and knows something pretty much about everything.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305555">Combined with her probable fortune, I look upon Loo as a fair compensation for the loss of poor dear Carrie. It is true that I am to enjoy Carrie's fortune during my life; but then, as her father left all to his wife for life, and my late mother-in-law is alive and likely to live for ages, it may be years before I come into possession of it—awful thought, she may outlive me! Loo invariably speaks of her as 'your mother-in-law'; but, as I tell her, 'death severs all those ties.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305557">Now, it is very evident that the Talbots have plenty of money at present; and, as I cannot shut my eyes to the fact that Loo is sixteen or seventeen years younger than poor dear Carrie, I cannot but regard her as compensation for the loss of so faithful and devoted a partner as she was. Only one thing disturbs my peace of mind: she has not the same sweet yielding gentleness of disposition as my late wife. To Carrie, my word was law; she never said 'no' to anything <hi rend="italic">I</hi> said. To my mind, nothing equals that particular trait in the feminine character. I wish Loo had more of it. I admire the girl's character immensely, as I should admire the fire of an unbroken filly; but I intend, when we are married, to alter a good deal which now strikes me as highly objectionable. She is not sufficiently yielding—though to her mother she yields instantly. Perhaps it is only her playfulness; girls <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305556" n="518     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>like to show their power over their suitors—Loo is only like all the rest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305558">All the same, it is somewhat remarkable that she never does give way to me. I won't condescend to ask the question, but did she, I wonder, treat that fellow in India so? I wish she hadn't been so desperately fond of him—little evidences of it keep cropping up continually; per example, I called at their appartemente—I have quite got into the habit of calling daily—rather earlier than usual yesterday morning, and surprised them at breakfast, Loo with her hair floating far below her waist.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305559">'Your hair is superb,' I found an opportunity of whispering.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305560">'So most people tell me,' she said coolly and quite aloud.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305561">'You wouldn't like to part with any of it?' I hinted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305562">'Certainly not, Mr. Tankerville!'—then sighed impatiently.
'I never but once gave any of it away, and then it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a lump—as thick as my wrist.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305563">'Foolish child!' murmured the mother.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305564">'Ah, yes, foolish child,' echoed Loo, with a sigh and a shiver. 'It's a horridly unlucky thing to give any of your hair away. 'Then her mood changed, and she began to laugh. 'I think I'll give you a bit, Mr. Tankerville.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305565">Did that mean that she didn't care whether I had good luck or bad? She took care, though, <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give me any.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305566">Whether it was the allusion to the old love or not, I don't know; but this morning Loo and I have had quite a chapter of accidents—I should say disagreeables.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305567">First of all, Mrs. Talbot, as soon as we reached the Pare, declared herself tired; how she could be I don't know, for she took that confounded tram from Porte Louise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305568">'Oh, I want some peaches!' Loo cried; 'I'm so thirsty.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305569">I had taken four fine peaches to their appartement that morning, and reminded her of the fact.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305570">'Yes, it was awfully good of you; but I want some <hi rend="italic">now</hi>, this minute.' She laughed. 'So I'm going to the market to get some. You stay and talk to mother.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305571">'I cannot think of allowing it,' I said decidedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305572">Loo looked me up and down, and through and through, with contemptuous eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305573">'<hi rend="italic">You</hi> can't think of—allowing—<hi rend="italic">me</hi>,' she repeated slowly, then broke into a little scornful laugh. 'My good man, I have travelled five hundred miles perfectly alone.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305574" n="519     LOO"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305575">her, a good bed to sleep on, fair food to eat, and certainly plenty of it. She had a salary which, since she was a Frenchwoman, and could make a shilling do the work of half a crown (so I am told, yet I find a French bonnet costs just twice as much as an English one—odd that, rather), would clothe her decently, and a principal who, if she couldn't exchange a word with her, had always a pleasant smile for her and very often a motherly kiss.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305576">On the other hand, this girl had the world—<hi rend="italic">the world</hi>—nothing but the world—a world of strangers. Father, mother, brother or sister she had none. She stood alone,</p><q>'A feeble little one . . .</q><q>In the thickest of the fight.'</q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305577">Poor feeble one!—she was only seventeen—at the best it was but a dull life. She was slow to learn English, and her pupils were infinitely slower to learn French. She had no one with whom to exchange an idea, and the luxury of a 'good talk' was one she seemed never likely to enjoy again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305578">However, three months slipped over, and then the schoolmistress paid her her salary—four golden sovereigns. On the first half-holiday she went into the town with the best French-speaking pupil that she might buy a pair of boots, which had been a necessity long enough. It happened that this very girl was going to spend the evening with friends, so when the boots were satisfactorily purchased, Mademoiselle de Roche-fontaine escorted her to their house, returning home alone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305579">While walking leisurely along the semi-rural road, she was startled by hearing herself addressed in her native tongue—her dear native tongue, fluently spoken, and with the purest Parisian accent. She looked up from an absorbing calculation as to how far she would be able to make her four sovereigns go, and found a stranger standing uncovered beside her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305580">This stranger was tall, elderly, and gray-haired, with that grand air of distinction of which you see so much more across the Channel than you do in this pushing, go-ahead country of ours. To Diane de Rochefontaine, after three months—they seemed more like years—spent amongst second- or even third-rate people, his manner had the perfect polish of the good society to which she had been accustomed in her youth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305582">He turned and walked beside her, telling her he had heard of her some days before, that they were relations, he being the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305581" n="520     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/> What did she—what could she mean? I admit that there were passages in my earlier life of which I should not like Loo to be cognizant. Can she know anything of them?</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305583">'Let us look at this lace a minute,' she said, evidently to change the conversation.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305584">I acquiesced.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305585">'I have quantities of that lace at home in every stage of manufacture,' I told her. 'When my poor dear wife died, I packed it all away with her jewels and wardrobe. It is just like this,' I said, pointing to the window.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305586">'Ah, I suppose you bought it when you were here before?' she said carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305587">'Oh no; my wife made it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305588">'Oh, modern point!' Her tone was slighting in the extreme. 'Really, I wonder you kept it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305589">'Kept it!' I echoed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305590">'Yes; I should have thought you would have given it to her mother and sisters,' she said sharply. 'Her clothes, too, you say—did you keep <hi rend="italic">them?</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305591">'Ye—es,' I admitted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305592">A queer smile curled about her lips.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305593">'Then, you have those sables she used to wear—those her mother gave her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305594">'Oh yes, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305595">'I thought her mother had them put on to that new velvet coat for her?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305596">'So she did, for her birthday.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305597">'Why, I met her one morning, three or four months after poor Carrie died, and she told me she had been paying the bill for it. Well, I think if I were Mrs. Conway, and you had kept the coat, I should have let you pay the bill. Then, did you keep her trinkets and things?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305598">'Yes; a lovely belt and chatelaine made of coins,' I began, thinking how well it would become Loo's slender waist.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305599">'I never heard of such a mean thing in all my life,' said Loo deliberately. 'And when Mrs. Conway has all those grandchildren! Why, the things cannot be of the slightest use to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305600">Not be of the slightest use! I had thought how well they would become Loo's fine person. Carrie was an uncommonly fine woman—if anything, a trifle larger built than Loo. I had thought that would be no disadvantage to the various garments.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305601" n="521     LOO"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305602">'Here we are,' she said, turning into the passage of the Madeleine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305603">Instantly we were assailed by a babel of unintelligible jargon, the market-people evidently taking us for a newly-married couple. They wanted me to buy flowers for Loo; I was not averse to it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305604">'Kom-biang?' I asked, surveying the huge bouquets critically.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305605">The vendor answered at some length. I was obliged to shake my head, not understanding bad French.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305606">Loo explained 'Seven francs fifty,' and laughed. 'Why, it's perfectly absurd!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305607">Before I could reckon seven francs fifty into English coin, she had walked on with a careless 'Bonjour.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305608">The man caught her back by her dress.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305609">'Je n'ai pas besoin,' she told him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305610">She always professed herself as being utterly unable to speak French, yet, somehow, she seemed able to get on well enough with these people.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305611">'Six francs, mademoiselle,' he pleaded. 'Très bon marché.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305612">Loo laughed again, and repeated her 'Bonjour.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305613">'I should like to buy one,' I told her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305614">'Would you? Six francs is too much,' she said in the most business-like tone imaginable.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305615">So forthwith she and the man haggled and gabbled in a language I could not understand in the least. I had already discovered that she knew as much Flemish as French, and very wild it used to make me when she would sit on the front seat of those beastly trams and talk to the driver, I having to talk to Mrs. Talbot, because I couldn't follow a single word of what Loo was saying. And when I remonstrated with the girl, she stopped my mouth by declaring she was studying character. As if <hi rend="italic">my</hi> wife need study anyone's character but mine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305616">At last she announced that he had come down to two-fifty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305617">'You can't very well beat him down lower than that, and I think it's worth it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305619">I took out a handful of silver, considering the while what two-fifty meant. Loo pounced upon a broad silver piece, and handed it over to the man, popping the change into my hand amongst the other money before I could reckon anything. My accounts will all be wrong; however, I must make them <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305618" n="522     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>as square as I can. I asked her to direct the man to send it to my hotel.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305620">'Who's it for?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305621">'For you, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305622">'For me! Oh, you shouldn't have troubled to buy it for me. I don't much care for flowers, except when they're loose. It's really very kind of you, though. Send it to the hotel? Oh, they won't care to do that; take it yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305623">Eventually that was what I had to do. I could not tell the man myself, for his stock of French seemed limited, and Loo wouldn't help me out with the Flemish. In fact, she went so far as to say, if I didn't carry it, she wouldn't accept it. So we returned to the Parc, she laden with fruit and crushed roses—I mean roses crumpled by nature—I carrying my great bouquet, in size as large as a wash-hand-basin. I felt very absurd, but Loo seemed tremendously amused.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305624">Indeed, she laughed so, that I seized the opportunity of broaching a somewhat unpleasant subject which had weighed on my mind all the morning.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305625">'I think you met my sister at my house,' I said, as we toiled up the Rue de la Madeleine.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305626">'Yes, I did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305627">'She and her husband are coming here on Saturday.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305628">'Really.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305629">Loo was not very much interested in my sister or her husband.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305630">'I hope you won't mind,' I said hesitatingly—I know what Jemima's temper is, and Loo's high spirit—' but my sister, Mrs. Pergolesi Stubbins, has always been very much spoilt. She has rather an imperious manner, and—and—she is a good deal accustomed to her own way—and—and—if—er—if——</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305631">'I'll tell you what, Mr. Tankerville,' Loo said laughingly, yet with a dangerous gleam in her eyes,' if Mrs. Pergolesi Stubbins has the impertinence to give me any of her imperious manner she will get the worst of it. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have been a good deal spoilt. <hi rend="italic">I</hi> am accustomed to my own way, you know; and, then, I've at least thirty years the advantage of her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305633">It was a rude speech, I admit it; still, I must confess I do <hi rend="italic">not</hi> blame Loo for making it. I must keep them as much apart as possible. I know what Jemima's temper is—no one better: imperious is a decidedly euphonious way of putting it. Even poor dear Carrie, who was amiability itself, could not get on with her; and strictly <hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>, I shouldn't be at all sorry <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305632" n="523     LOO"/>
if Loo, unlike Carrie, who simply kept out of her way, were roused sufficiently to take Jemima thoroughly down.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305634">'They won't want us much, you know; they've not been married long, they are as yet all in all to each other,' I said, thinking of the time when Loo and I would be all in all to each other also.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305635">'Elderly spoons,' remarked Loo flippantly. 'Oh Lord!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305636">The remark absolutely took my breath away, but Loo never seemed to notice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305637">'To be sure,' she went on, 'she was a widow when I met her—Mrs. Goldstein. A distinguished-looking woman.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305638">I glanced aside to see if she were quite serious. Oh yes; not a ghost of a smile was on her face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305639">'She is considered very handsome,' I remarked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305640">'Oh, is she? I should hardly call her that myself; "distinguished-looking" seems to me to describe her exactly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305641">Loo is quite right. Jemima <hi rend="italic">is</hi> of distinguished appearance; <hi rend="italic">entre nous</hi>, she is of distinguished temper, too—of the order known as 'tiger-cat.' I am afraid when she and Loo come in contact as probable sisters-in-law, it will be a case of Greek meeting Greek; not that I wish to imply that Loo is a tiger-cat—far from it. I admire Loo's character immensely; her disposition is most sunny; never yet have I seen her out of temper, and I have watched her closely. All her little daring speeches to me are made with a laughing air, and with a series of dimples twinkling about her mouth. She <hi rend="italic">says</hi> when I have once seen her in a temper, I shall never forget it; but Loo has a way of putting herself in the worst possible light. I rather admire her modesty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305642">Jemima and her husband are to come to-morrow; they remain in Bruxelles three days on their way to Homburg. For my part, I wish the visit was over.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305643">By-the-bye, Loo is a daring little puss. She stopped her ears this morning and cried out:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305644">'For goodness' sake, Charon, do pronounce it as it's spelt.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305645">'What is that?' I asked blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305646">'Why, Homburg, to be sure. It must be easier to say Hom-burg than Home-bourg. And when you're talking English, why give the places a foreign sound? Why should you say Co-long? It certainly is not German, for that is Cöln. It is not French, for that is pronounced like Boulogne, which isn't exactly called Boolong.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305647" n="524     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305648">'I always call it Co-long,' I said, a trifle startled by her vehemence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305649">' But it's wrong. The English is Kolone. And the other day, when we were talking about the Rhine, you corrected me every time I mentioned a place'—in an aggrieved tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305650">'Did I?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305651">I remembered the circumstance distinctly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305652">'Yes, and all wrong, too. You called Bonn, Boonne. I should say B-O-N-N is the easiest of the two; and when I mentioned Co-blenz, you repeated it distinctly as Co-<hi rend="italic">blaaantz</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305653">'But it is Co-blaaantz,' I maintained.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305654">'But it is not; any German would tell you so. Frankfort, too—you called it, the moment I had uttered the word, Franc'-for'. Of course, it makes no matter to me what you call them, only I do not like to be corrected before other people, particularly when I know I'm in the right.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305655">'I won't do it any more,' I said humbly, though I was raging inwardly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305656">'Please don't; and the next time I say anything about the legends of the Rhine, don't correct me the next minute with lee-gends.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305657">Then she laughed, and so did I.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305658">'Ah, I'll pay you out for all this, one of these days!' I cried.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305659">It was a slip—a most foolish one. I admit it. Indeed, I could have bitten my tongue off the moment the words had passed my lips. For the very first time in all my intercourse with Loo I saw a gleam of real anger in her eyes. She shut her teeth with a sharp <hi rend="italic">clique</hi>—ah! no, no; I have got so into the habit of using French words; I should say 'click'—looked straight at me with her wide-open eyes, and smiled a smile that had no mirth in it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305660">'You—<hi rend="italic">nev</hi>—er will,' she said deliberately. ' Never! never! <hi rend="italic">nev</hi>—er!' and what is more, she said it uncommonly as if she meant it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305661">I don't think I should have minded it so much, only Mrs. Talbot laughed—a little scornful laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305662">'It is time for us to go home, dear,' she said.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305663">'Yes; let us have a victoria,' Loo replied.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305664">She hailed one before I could lift my hand. However, I was determined she should not give the directions to the driver.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305665">'Er—cocher!' I said authoritatively; 'to—er—Kwur-rong-doo, Roo doo Prwanz Woy-al.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305666" n="525     LOO"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305667">'Just like my luck—the man was semi-imbecile. He scratched his head, looked round at Loo, and said, 'Quelle place?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305668">I repeated the directions—nothing could have been plainer, but not one gleam of understanding shone on that idiot's face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305669">Loo roared. As for the old cat, Mrs. Talbot, she sat back in the little carriage and laughed till she wept; the idiot on the box laughed hardest of the three.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305670">At last Loo found her voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305671">'Straat de Prinz-Roial—twee en vierte.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305672">I was convinced it was mere polyglot gibberish—afterwards Loo said I was right—but, would you believe it, that grinning beast on the box grinned worse than ever, shouted 'Ja—ja—Jevrouw,' whipped up his horse, and was off in a jiffy, nearly running over my toes as he went.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_252" n="5" type="episode"><head>EPISODE V.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305673">I KNEW what Jemima would be—I was convinced of it. She has done it this time, and no mistake about it. However, happily it is for herself she has done—not for me.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305674">The day after they arrived, I took an opportunity of presenting her to Mrs. Talbot and Loo.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305675">The effect was magical!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305676">Jemima went up smiling in her most gracious manner—the Talbots are gentlewomen—I need say no more. Yet, by the extraordinary freemasonry which exists among women, the meeting was a dead failure. Why, I cannot say. I am sure there was no lack of cordiality on either side, but Jemima didn't stay three minutes. Pergolesi, however, did. He stayed about an hour and a half. The Talbots took to him instantly—Mrs. Talbot unbent, and they found they had many mutual friends. I was a little out of it. Not that I minded that—I was only too glad they proved such agreeable company for each other.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305677">As for Loo, she appeared charmed by my sister's husband, and showed to her greatest advantage. I may add here that when and where Loo really exerts herself to please, she lays aside all her little mannerisms and becomes a very fascinating young woman. Pergolesi evidently found her so, to judge by the time he remained chatting.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305678">'I think I ought to go and look after Jemima,' I said at length.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305679" n="526     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305680">'Yes, do,' said Pergolesi; but he didn't stir.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305681">So I went. I found her stamping up and down, just like an enraged tigress.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305682">'Where is Pergolesi?' she demanded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305683">'Oh, he's with my friends,' I answered as pleasantly as I could.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305684">'What do you mean by keeping him in this manner?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305685">'Why did you go away?' I asked. 'Come back with me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305686">'Come back! Not I, indeed. I am going to the hotel; I shall leave Brussels to-night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305687">I watched her out of sight, and then I rejoined the others.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305688">'Where is your sister?' Pergolesi asked—he always speaks of his wife thus.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305689">'She has gone back to the hotel. I think she's not very well,' I answered, making the best I could of the matter.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305690">'Then I must go, too,' he said, rising; but he didn't go for a good bit then. Poor chap! I've no doubt he had a very <hi rend="italic">mauvais quart d'heure</hi> when he did go. I know Jemima.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305691">'What do you think of my brother-in-law?' I said to Loo, sitting down beside her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305692">Loo looked straight up into my eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305693">'Charming! Awfully handsome—aristocratic—everything pleasant. I <hi rend="italic">do</hi> admire that style of man!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305694">I was pleased, though Pergolesi is as great a contrast to me as could well be found—a big, fair fellow with sleepy eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305695">'Do you admire his way of speaking?' I asked. Pergolesi speaks about the rate of a word a minute.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305696">'Rather!'—spoken in a way intended to convey that she admired it very much. 'Was he rich?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305697">'No. He has a little; my sister was a rich widow, you know.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305698">
'<hi rend="italic">Oh</hi>—I—see.' Her tone was significant in the extreme, 'I say, what was the matter with her that she went off like that? It wasn't very mannerly, was it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305699">'It certainly was not. However, you needn't mind.' And then I couldn't resist telling her about Jemima, and how I found her stamping up and down.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305700">A dozen little imps of mischief dimpled out on Loo's cheeks instantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305701">'What fun!' she cried. 'If they stop here, won't I flirt with Mr. Pergolesi—I don't think he'd mind.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305703">But they left Bruxelles that very night. I know what Jemima's temper is, and I took care Pergolesi should know it <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305702" n="527     LOO"/>also. I broached the subject when he and I were talking over the matter of settlements.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305704">'May I ask,' I said, 'if you have ever noticed the slight acrimony of my sister's temper?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305705">He laughed a little; said he had witnessed some tremendous scenes, but hoped to conquer all that.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305706">'I hope so, too, my dear chap,' I told him; 'but you'll be a devilish clever fellow if you do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305707">'Poor fellow!' murmured Loo softly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305708">Loo is altering. She has grown much more sweet and charming lately, and she will undoubtedly be able to hold her own with Jemima.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_253" n="6" type="episode"><head>EPISODE VI.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305709">IT is all over! Loo and I have parted! I have been cheated—duped—made a fool of—but, there, I will finish my story.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305710">I left the Talbots in Bruxelles, my holiday having expired. I left Loo with much tenderness, though I had not an opportunity of saying anything private.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305711">When I got home I was hailed at my club with:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305712">'Hallo, old man, where have you been? haven't seen you for ages!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305713">'Continong,' I replied tersely; 'never enjoyed myself so much in my life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305714">'Really! The Talbots are abroad somewhere, are they not?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305715">'Er—yes. I—I—in fact, I went to join them.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305716">'B—y Jove!' there was a regular chorus. 'So Loo has capitulated at last! I heard she'd gone to London to buy her trousseau.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305717">I smiled serenely.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305718">'So it's all settled, eh?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305719">I smiled again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305720">'It has all been <hi rend="italic">settled</hi> some time; but—you see—my term of mourning—er—ߞ'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305721">'Oh, going to be married when the year's up, eh?' said someone impatiently. 'By Jove, Tankerville, but you're a lucky dog!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305722">I admitted the soft impeachment. I said I <hi rend="italic">was</hi> a lucky dog. I laughed; they laughed; we all laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305723">I left the club then, having elsewhere to go. At the foot of the stairs I paused to fold up my umbrella, which had become undone, and I heard a voice say distinctly:</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305724" n="528     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305725">'Poor girl!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305726">I stayed to hear more—I confess I was rooted to the spot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305727">'Jolly girl!' I heard another voice say. 'Great shame to marry a brute like Tankerville! I suppose she wants to let the other fellow see——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305728">'I wonder if she knows about——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305729">But I rushed away then; I didn't want to hear any more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305730">A fortnight later they returned. I did not see them for several days—in fact, I did not know they had come back until I met Loo and her aunt in the Winter Garden.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305731">In an instant I realized that something had gone wrong. Loo wouldn't look at me—wouldn't even speak to me.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305732">'What's the matter, Loo?' I asked, bending down, for she was seated on a chair at the end of a row facing the orchestra.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305733">'Don't call me "Loo," please,' she said curtly. 'I am Miss Talbot!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305734">'Have I made you angry?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305735">'Yes.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305736">'Come with me into one of the alleys away from this crush,' I whispered. 'I ought to have an explanation.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305737">'I don't want an explanation,' Loo said loftily. 'I prefer remaining as we are.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305738">'Out of friends?' I said reproachfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305739">'Out of friends! We never were <hi rend="italic">friends</hi>,' she answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305740">'But it is not fair to condemn a man unheard.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305741">Happily, Miss Graves was chaperon this evening, and is the easiest of duennas.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305742">'What have I done?' I implored.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305743">'Oh, I'll tell you!'—recklessly. 'I hear you've been chaffed about me in that—<hi rend="italic">club</hi> of yours'—the pause before, and emphasis on, the word 'club' was anything but flattering—'and so far from contradicting what was said, you added to it.

A fib or two was nothing compared to losing Loo. 'Who told you?' I asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305748">'I shall not tell you!'—curtly. 'And that's not all! you said you'd been abroad to join us—that everything had been <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305747" n="529     LOO"/>settled some time—otherwise, that you and I were engaged, and were only waiting until the year was over to be—<hi rend="italic">married</hi>.

Loo's eyes opened as if she was never going to close them again. 'Do you threaten me with a court of justice? You need not lower yourself; all the courts of justice in the world would not frighten me. You know I'm rather a clever woman, Mr. Tankerville. I know just twice as much about law as you do.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305757">She was evidently not to be frightened into anything. I changed my tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305758">'Loo, don't you care for me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305759">'Not a bit! And don't call me "Loo," please. I never gave you permission to do so.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305760">'I know you care for me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305761">'Mr. Tankerville,' she said gravely, 'have I ever said a really civil word to you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305762">'Well, hardly ever,' I admitted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305763">'Have I not persistently and systematically shown myself to you in the worst possible light? Have I not been persistently rude to you? Indeed, I blush to think how rude I often have been. Have I not done everything I could to prevent your speaking out? Did I not leave your letters unanswered? Did not my mother write to you plainly, "If you will take my advice, you will <hi rend="italic">not</hi> come to Brussels whilst we are here"? Have I not many and many a time made you so angry you could almost have killed me? Did we not tell you in veiled terms and in plain terms that we did not want you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305764">'I thought it was all fun.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305765">'Fun!' In spite of her anger she laughed.

'No, Mr. Tankerville, we did everything we could do to prevent this happening, and you have only yourself to thank for it all.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305777">'I never saw—I never thought—if I had had the least idea my attentions were in any way distasteful to you——' I began.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305778">'Oh, nonsense, Mr. Tankerville!' she interrupted brusquely. 'You saw very well; and, oh, didn't you mean to pay me out for it all by-and-by!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305779">I have written to Mrs. Talbot long letters, to which I have received the most unsatisfactory replies. The story has gone the round of the town, and a good many people have had the bad taste to allude to it. I must lay aside my lightened habiliments, and declare my devotion to poor Carrie's memory unchanged; but, unfortunately, as two of the club fellows overheard the whole of my last conversation with Loo, I shall not be able altogether to convey that impression to everybody.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305780">A month has passed. Jemima and her husband came visit me for a week. Pergolesi's first question was for Miss Talbot, and when the wedding was to come off. I replied evasively. Just like my usual luck!—we met the Talbots in the street two minutes after, and at the grave bows which were exchanged he looked surprised, then laughed. I trust I shall repay that laugh one of these days with interest.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305781">This evening I took him to my club, and the moment I showed my face the fellows all shouted:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305782">'Hallo, Tankerville, come and play <hi rend="italic">Loo!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305783">It is a poor joke; but they seem as if they would never be tired of it.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305784" n="531     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_260" n="13" type="story"><head>KOOSJE; A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305785">HER name was Koosje van Kampen, and she lived in Utrecht—that most quaint of quaint cities—the Venice of the North.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305786">All her life had been passed under the shadow of the grand old Dom Kerk: she had played bo-peep behind the columns and arcades of the ruined moss-grown cloisters; had slipped up and fallen down the steps leading to the grachts; had once or twice, in very early life this, been fished out of those same slimy, stagnant waters; had wandered under the great lindens in the Baan, and gazed curiously up at the stork's nest in the tree by the Veterinary School; had pattered about the hollow-sounding streets in her noisy wooden klompen; had danced and laughed; had quarrelled and wept, and fought and made friends again, to the tune of the silver chimes high up in the Dom—chimes that were sometimes old Nederlandsche hymns, sometimes Mendelssohn's melodious and tender 'Lieder ohne Wörte.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305787">But that was ever so long ago; and now she had left her romping childhood behind her, and had become a maidservant—a very dignified and aristocratic maidservant indeed—with no less a sum than eight pounds ten a year in wages.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305788">She lived in the house of a Professor, who dwelt on the Munster-Kerkhoff, one of the most aristocratic parts of that wonderfully aristocratic city; and once or twice every week you might have seen her, if you had been there to see, busily engaged in washing the red-tile and blue-slate pathway in front of the Professor's house. You would have seen that she was very pleasant to look at, this Koosje, very comely and clean, whether she happened to be very busy, or whether it had been Sunday, and, with her best gown on, she was out for a promenade in the Baan, after duly going to service, for Koosje was strictly orthodox, and attended service as regularly as the Sabbath dawned in the grand old Gothic choir of the cathedral.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305789">During the week she wore always the same costume as does every other servant in the country: a skirt of black stuff, short enough to show a pair of very neat feet and well-turned ankles, clad in cloth shoes and knitted stockings that showed no wrinkles; over the skirt a bodice and kirtle of lilac, made a neatly-gathered frilling about her round brown throat.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305790" n="532     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305791">Above the frilling five or six rows of unpolished garnet beads, fastened by a massive clasp of gold filigree; and on her head a spotless white cap, tied with a neat bow under her chin—as neat, let me tell you, as an Englishman's tie at a party.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305792">But it was on Sunday that Koosje shone forth in all the glory of a black gown and her jewellery—with great earrings to match the clasp of her necklace, and a heavy chain and cross to match that again, and one or two rings; while on her head she wore an immense cap, much too big to put a bonnet over, though for walking she was most particular to have gloves.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305793">Then, indeed, she was a young person to be treated with respect, and with respect she undoubtedly was treated. As she passed along the quaint, resounding streets, many a head was turned to look after her; but Koosje went on her way, like the staid maiden she was, duly impressed with the fact that she was principal servant to Professor von Dijck, the most celebrated authority on the study of osteology in Europe. So Koosje never heeded the looks, turned her head neither to the right hand nor to the left, but went sedately on her business or pleasure, whichever it happened to be.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305794">It was not likely that such a treasure could remain long unnoticed and unsought after. Servants in the Netherlands, I hear, are not so good but that they might be better, and most people knew what a treasure Professor van Dijck had in his Koosje. However, as the Professor conscientiously raised her wages from time to time, Koosje never thought of leaving him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305796">But there is one bribe no woman can resist—the bribe that is offered by Love. As Professor van Dijck had expected and feared, that bribe ere long was held out to Koosje, and Koosje was too weak to resist it. Not that he wished her to do so. If the girl had a chance of settling well and happily for life, he would be the last to dream of throwing any obstacles in her way. He had come to be an old man himself—he lived all alone, save for his servants, in a great rambling house, whose huge apartments were all set out with horrible anatomical preparations and grisly skeletons; and, though the stately passages were paved with white marble, and led into rooms which would easily have accommodated crowds of guests, he went into no society, save that of savants as old and fossil-like as himself; in other words, he was an old bachelor who lived entirely for his profession and the study of the great masters <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305795" n="533     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/>—by the interpretation of a genuine old Stradivari. Yet the old Professor had a memory: he recalled the time when he had been young who now was old—the time when his heart was a good deal more tender, his blood a great deal warmer, and his fancy very much more easily stirred than nowadays. There was a dead and gone romance which had broken his heart, sentimentally speaking—a romance long since crumbled into dust, which had sent him for comfort to the study of osteology and the music of the Stradivari; yet the memory thereof made him considerably more lenient to Koosje's weakness than Koosje herself had ever expected to find him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305797">Not that she had intended to tell him just at first—she was only three-and-twenty—and, though Jan van der Welde was as fine a fellow as could be seen in Utrecht, and had good wages and something put by, Koosje was by no means inclined to rush headlong into matrimony with undue hurry. It was more pleasant to live in the Professor's good house, to have delightful walks arm-in-arm with Jan under the trees in the Baan or round the Singles, parting under the stars, with many a lingering word and promise to meet again; it was during one of those very partings that the Professor suddenly became aware, as he walked placidly home, of the change that had come into Koosje's life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305798">However, Koosje told him blushingly that she did not wish to leave him just at present, so he did not trouble himself about the matter; he was a wise man, the old authority on osteology, and quoted oftentimes, 'Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305799">So the courtship sped smoothly on, seeming for once to contradict the truth of the old saying, 'The course of true love never did run smooth.' The course of their love did, of a truth, run marvellously smooth indeed. Koosje, if a trifle coy, was pleasant and sweet; Jan as fine a fellow as ever waited round a corner on a cold winter's night. So, brightly the happy days slipped by, when suddenly a change was effected in the Professor's household, which made, as a matter of course, somewhat of a change in Koosje's life. It came about in this wise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305801">Koosje had been on an errand for the Professor, one that had kept her out of doors some time, and it happened that the night was bitterly cold—the cold indeed was fearful. The air had that damp rawness so noticeable in the Dutch climate; <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305800" n="534     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>thick mist overhung the city, and a drizzling rain came down with a steady persistence such as quickly soaked through the stoutest and thickest garments. The streets were well-nigh empty. That great business thoroughfare, the Oude Gracht, was almost deserted, and as Koosje hurried along the Meiner-broederstraat—for she had a second commission there—she drew her great shawl more tightly round her, muttering crossly, 'What weather! yesterday so warm, to-day so cold. 'Tis enough to give one the fever.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305802">She delivered her message, and ran on through the Oude Kerkhoff as fast as her feet could carry her, when, just as she turned the corner into the Domplein, a fierce gust of wind, accompanied by a blinding shower of rain, assailed her; her foot caught against something soft and heavy, and she fell.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305803">'Bless us!' she ejaculated blankly, 'what fool has left a bundle out on the path on such a night? Pitch-dark, with half the lamps out, and rain and mist enough to blind one.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305804">She gathered herself up, rubbing elbows and knees vigorously, casting the while dark glances at the obnoxious bundle which had caused the disaster. Just then the wind was lulled, the lamp close at hand gave out a steady light, which shed its rays through the fog upon Koosje and the bundle, from which, to the girl's horror and dismay, came a faint moan. Quickly she drew nearer, when she perceived that what she had believed to be a bundle was, indeed, a woman, apparently in the last stage of exhaustion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305805">Koosje tried to lift her, but the dead weight was beyond her, young and strong as she was. Then the rain and the wind came on again, in fiercer gusts than before; the woman's moans grew louder and louder, and what to do Koosje knew not.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305806">She struggled on for the few steps which lay between her and the Professor's house, and then she rang a peal which resounded through the echoing passages, bringing Dortje, the other maid, running out, after the manner of her class, imagining all sorts of terrible catastrophes had happened. She uttered a cry of relief when she perceived that it was only Koosje, who, without vouchsafing any explanation, dashed past her and ran straight into the Professor's room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305807">'Oh, Professor,' she gasped out; but between her efforts to move the woman, her struggle with the elements, and her race down the passage, her breath was utterly gone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305809">The Professor looked up from his book and his tea-tray in <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305808" n="535     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/>surprise. For a moment he thought that Koosje, his domestic treasure, had altogether taken leave of her senses, for she was steaming with water, covered with mud, and head and cap were in a state of disorder such as neither he nor anyone else had ever seen them in since the last time she had been fished out of the Nieuwe Gracht.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305810">'What is the matter, Koosje?' he asked, regarding her gravely over his spectacles.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305811">'There is a woman outside—dying,' she panted. 'I fell over her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305812">'You had better try to get her in, then,' the old gentleman said in quite a relieved tone. 'You and Dortje must bring her in. Dear, dear, poor soul! but it is a dreadful night.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305813">The old gentleman shivered as he spoke, and drew a little nearer to the tall white porcelain stove.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305814">It was, as he had said a minute before, a terrible night, He could hear the wind beating about the house, and rattling the casements, and moaning down the chimneys. And to think any poor soul should be out on such a night—<hi rend="italic">dying</hi>. Heaven preserve others who might be belated or houseless in any part of the world!</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305815">He fell then into a fit of abstraction—a habit not uncommon with very learned men—wondering why life should be so different to different people. Why he should be in that warm, handsome room, with its soft rich hangings and carpet, with its beautiful furniture of carved wood, its pictures, and the rare china scattered here and there among the grim array of skeletons which were his delight. He wondered why he should take his tea out of costly and valuable Oriental china, his sugar and cream out of antique silver, while other poor souls had no tea at all, and nothing to take it out of if they had. He wondered why he should have a lamp under his teapot, that was a very marvel of art transparencies. Why he should have every luxury, and this poor creature should be dying in the street, amid the wind and the rain. It was all very unequal.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305816">It was very odd, the Professor argued, leaning his back against the tall warm stove; it was very odd indeed. He began to feel that, grand as the study of osteology undoubtedly is, he ought not to permit it to become so engrossing as to blind him to the study of the greater philosophies of life. His reverie was, however, broken by the abrupt re-entrance of Koosje, who this time was a trifle less breathless than she had been before.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305817" n="536     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305818">'We have got her into the kitchen, Professor,' she announced. 'She is a child—a mere baby, and so pretty! She has opened her eyes and spoken.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305819">'Give her some soup and wine—hot,' said the Professor without stirring.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305820">'But won't you come?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305821">The Professor hesitated; he hated attending in cases of illness, though he was a properly qualified doctor, and in an emergency would lay his prejudice aside.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305822">'Or shall I run across for the good Dr. Smit?' Koosje asked. 'He would come in a minute, only it is <hi rend="italic">such</hi> a night!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305823">At that moment a fiercer gust than before rattled at the casements, and the Professor laid aside his scruples.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305824">'I will come, Koosje,' he said briefly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305825">He followed his housekeeper down the chilly marble-flagged passage into the kitchen, where he never went for months together. A cosy enough, pleasant place, with a deep valance hanging from the broad mantel-shelf, with many great copper pans, bright and shining as new gold, and furniture all scrubbed to the whiteness of snow.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305826">In an armchair before the opened stove sat the rescued girl—a slight golden-haired thing, with wistful blue eyes and a frightened air. Every moment she caught her breath in a half-hysterical sob, while violent shivers shook her from head to foot.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305827">The Professor went and looked at her over his spectacles, as if she had been some curious specimen of his favourite study; but at the same time he kept at a respectful distance from her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305828">'Give her some soup and wine,' he said at length, putting his hands under the tails of his long dressing-gown of flowered cashmere. 'Some soup and wine—hot; and put her to bed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305829">'Is she, then, to remain for the night?' Koosje asked, a little surprised.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305830">'Oh, don't send me away!' the golden-haired girl broke out in a voice that was positively a wail, and clasping a pair of pretty, slender hands in piteous supplication.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305831">'Where do you come from?' the old gentleman asked, much as if he expected she might suddenly jump up and bite him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305832">'From Beijerland, Mynheer,' she answered with a sob.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305834">'So! Koosje, she is remarkably well dressed, is she not?' the Professor said, glancing at the costly lace head-gear, the heavy gold headpiece, which lay on a table together with the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305833" n="537     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/>great gold spiral ornaments and filigree pendants—a dazzling heap of richness. He looked, too, at the girl's white hands, at the rich crape-laden gown, at her delicate beauty and shower of waving golden hair, which, released from the confinement of the cap and headpiece, flowed in a rich mass of glittering beauty over the pillows which his servants had placed beneath her head.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305835">The Professor was old—the Professor was wholly given up to his profession, which he jokingly called his wife, and his Stradivari, which he jokingly called his sweetheart; and though he cut half his acquaintances in the street through inattention and the shortness of his sight, he had eyes in his head, and upon occasion could use them. He therefore repeated his question.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305836">'Very well dressed indeed, Professor,' returned Koosje promptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305837">'And what are you doing in Utrecht—in such a plight as this, too?' he asked, still keeping at a safe distance.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305838">'Oh, Mynheer, I am all alone in the world,' she answered, her blue misty eyes filled with tears. 'I had a month ago a dear good kind father, but he has died, and I am indeed desolate. I always believed him rich, and to these things,' with a gesture that included her dress and the ornaments on the table, 'I have ever been accustomed. Thus, I ordered without consideration such clothes as I thought needful. And then I found there was nothing for me, not a hundred guelders to call my own, when all was paid.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305839">'But what brought you to Utrecht?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305840">'He sent me here, Mynheer. In his last illness, only of three days' duration, he bade me gather all together and come to this city, where I was to ask for a Mevrouw Baake—his cousin.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305841">'Mevrouw Baake of the Sigaren Fabrijk,' said Dortje, in an aside to the others. 'I lived servant with her before I came here.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305842">'I had heard very little about her, only my father had sometimes mentioned his cousin to me; they had once been betrothed,' the stranger continued. 'But when I reached Utrecht I found she was dead—two years dead. But we had never heard of it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305843">'Dear, dear, dear!' exclaimed the Professor pityingly. 'Well, you had better let Koosje put you to bed, and we will see what can be done for you in the morning.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305844" n="538     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305845">'Am I to make up a bed?' Koosje asked, following him along the passage.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305846">The Professor wheeled round and faced her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305847">'She had better sleep in the guest-room,' he said thoughtfully, regardless of the cold, which struck to his slippered feet from the marble floor. 'That is the only room which does not contain specimens that would probably frighten the poor child. I am very much afraid, Koosje,' he concluded doubtfully, 'that she is a lady; and what we are to do with a lady, I can't think.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305848">With that, the old gentleman shuffled off to his cosy room, and Koosje turned back to her kitchen.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305849">'He'll never think of marrying her,' mused Koosje, rather blankly. If she had spoken her thoughts to the Professor himself, she would have received a very emphatic assurance that, much as the study of osteology and the Stradivari had blinded him to the affairs of this workaday world, he was not yet so thoroughly foolish as to join his fossilized wisdom to the ignorance of a child of sixteen or seventeen.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305850">However, on the morrow matters assumed a somewhat different aspect. Gertruide van Floote proved to be not exactly a gentlewoman. It is true that her father had been a well-to-do man for his station in life, and had very much spoiled and indulged his one motherless child. Yet her education was so slight that she could do little more than read and write, besides speaking a little English, which she had picked up from the yachtsmen frequenting her native town. The Professor found she had been but a distant relative of the Mevrouw Baake to seek whom she had come to Utrecht, and that she had no kinsfolk upon whom she could depend—a fact which accounted for the profusion of her jewellery, all her golden trinkets having descended to her as heirlooms.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305851">'I can be your servant, Mynheer,' she suggested. 'Indeed, I am a very useful girl, as you will find, if you will but try me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305852">Now, as a rule, the Professor vigorously set his face against admitting young servants into his house. They broke his china, they disarranged his bones, they meddled with his papers and made general havoc. So, in truth, he was no very willing to have Gertruide van Floote as a permanent member of his household, and he said so.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305854">But Koosje had taken a fancy to the girl, and having an <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305853" n="539     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/>eye to her own departure at no very distant date—for she had been betrothed more than two years—she pleaded so hard to keep her, promising to train her in all the Professor's ways, to teach her the value of old china and osteologic specimens, that eventually, with a good deal of grumbling, the old gentleman gave way; and being a wise as well as an old gentleman, went back to his studies, dismissing Koosje and the girl alike from his thoughts.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305855">Just at first Truide, poor child! was charmed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305856">She put away her splendid ornaments, and some lilac frocks and black skirts were purchased for her. Her box, which she had left at the station, supplied all that was necessary for Sunday.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305857">It was great fun! For a whole week this young person danced about the rambling old house, playing at being a servant. Then she began to grow a little weary of it all. She had been accustomed, of course, to performing such offices as all Dutch ladies fulfil: the care of china, of linen, the dusting of rooms, and the like; but she had done them as a mistress, not as an underling. And that was not the worst; it was when it came to her pretty feet having to be thrust into klompen, and her having to take a pail and syringe and mop and clean the windows, and the pathway and front of the house, that the game of maidservant began to assume a very different aspect. When, after having been as free as air to come and go as she chose, she was only permitted to attend service on Sundays, and to take an hour's promenade afterwards with Dortje, who was dull, and heavy, and stupid, she began to feel positively desperate, and the result of it all was that when Jan van der Welde came, as he was accustomed to do nearly every evening, to see Koosje, Miss Truide, from sheer longing for excitement and change, began to make eyes at him, with what effect I will endeavour to show.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305858">Just at first Koosje noticed nothing. She herself was of so faithful a nature that an idea, a suspicion, of Jan's falseness never entered her mind. When the girl laughed and blushed, and dimpled and smiled, when she cast her great blue eyes at the big young fellow, Koosje only thought how pretty she was, and that it was just a thousand pities she had not been horn a great lady.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305860">And thus weeks slipped over. Never very demonstrative herself, Koosje saw nothing. Dortje, for her part, saw a good <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305859" n="540     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>deal; but Dortje was a woman of few words, one who quite believed in the saying, 'If speech is silver, silence is gold;' so she held her peace.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305861">Now, Truide, rendered fairly frantic by her enforced confinement to the house, grew to look upon Jan as her only chance of excitement and distraction; and Jan, poor thick-headed noodle of six feet high, was thoroughly wretched. What to do he knew not. A strange, mad, fierce passion for Truide had taken possession of him, and an utter distaste, almost dislike, had come in the place of the old love for Koosje. Truide was unlike anything he had ever come in contact with before; she was so fairy-like, so light, so delicate, so dainty. Against Koosje's plumper, maturer charms, she appeared to the infatuated young man like—if he had ever heard of it, he would probably have said like a Dresden china image; but since he had not, he compared her in his own foolish heart to an angel. Her feet were so tiny, her hands so soft, her eyes so expressive, her waist so slim, her manner so bewitching. Somehow Koosje was altogether different; he could not endure the touch of her heavy hand, the tones of her less-refined voice; he grew impatient at the denser perceptions of her mind. It was very foolish, very short-sighted; for the hands, though heavy, were clever and willing—the voice, though a trifle coarser in accent than Truide's childish tones, would never tell him a lie—the perceptions, though not brilliant, were the perceptions of good everyday common-sense. It really was very foolish, for what charmed him most in Truide was the merest outside polish, a certain ease of manner which doubtless she had caught from the English aristocrats whom she had known in her native place. She had not half the sterling good qualities and steadfastness of Koosje; but Jan was in love, and did not stop to argue the matter as you or I are able to do. Men in love—very wise and great men too—are often like Jan van der Welde. They lay aside <hi rend="italic">pro tem</hi>. the whole amount, be it great or small, of wisdom they possess And it must be remembered that Jan van der Welde was neither a wise nor a great man.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305863">Well, in the end there came what the French call <hi rend="italic">undénouement</hi>—what we in forcible modern English would call a <hi rend="italic">smash</hi>—and it happened thus. It was one evening toward the summer that Koosje's eyes were suddenly opened, and she became aware of the free-and-easy familiarity of Truide's <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305862" n="541     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/>manner towards her betrothed lover, Jan. It was some very slight and trivial thing that led her to notice it, but in an instant the whole truth flashed across her mind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305864">'Leave the kitchen!' she said in a tone of authority.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305865">But it happened that at the very instant she spoke Jan was furtively holding Truide's fingers under cover of the tablecloth, and when, on hearing the sharp words, the girl would have snatched them away, he, with the true masculine instinct of opposition, held them fast.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305866">'What do you mean by speaking to her like that?' he demanded, an angry flush overspreading his dark face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305867">'What is the maid to you?' Koosje asked indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305868">'Maybe more than you are,' he retorted; in answer to which Koosje deliberately marched out of the kitchen, leaving them alone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305869">To say she was indignant would be but very mildly to express the state of her feelings—she was <hi rend="italic">furious</hi>. She knew that the end of her romance had come. No thought of making friends with Jan entered her mind—only a great storm filled her heart, till it was ready to burst with pain and anguish.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305870">As she went along the passage, the Professor's bell sounded, and Koosje, being close to the door, went abruptly in. The Professor looked up in mild astonishment, quickly enough changed to dismay as he caught sight of his valued Koosje's face, from out which anger seemed in a moment to have thrust all the bright, comely beauty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305871">'How now, my good Koosje?' said the old gentleman. 'Is aught amiss?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305872">'Yes, Professor, there is,' returned Koosje, all in a blaze of anger, and moving, as she spoke, the tea-tray, which she set down upon the oaken buffet with a bang which made its rare and delicate freight fairly jingle again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305873">'But you needn't break my china, Koosje,' suggested the old gentleman mildly, rising from his chair and getting into his favourite attitude before the stove.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305874">'You are quite right, Professor,' returned Koosje curtly—she was sensible even in her trouble.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305875">'And what is the trouble?' he asked gently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305876">'It is just this, Professor,' cried Koosje, setting her arms akimbo and speaking in a high-pitched, shrill voice: 'you and I have been warming a viper in our bosoms, and, viper-like, she has turned round and bitten me.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305877" n="542     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305878">'Is it Truide?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305879">'Truide,' she affirmed disdainfully. 'Yes, it is Truide, who, but for me, would be dead now of hunger and cold—or <hi rend="italic">worse</hi>. And she has been making love to that great fool, Jan van der Welde—great oaf that he is!—after all I have done for her—after my dragging her in out of the cold and the rain—after all I have taught her—ah, Professor, but it is a vile, venomous viper that we have been warming in our bosoms!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305880">'I must beg, Koosje,' said the old gentleman sedately, 'that you will exonerate me from any such proceeding. If you remember rightly, I was altogether against your plan for keeping her in the house;' he could not resist giving her that little dig, kind of heart as he was.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305881">'Serves me right for being so soft-hearted!' thundered Koosje. 'I'll be wiser next time I fall over a bundle, and leave it where I find it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305882">'No, no, Koosje; don't say that,' the old gentleman remonstrated gently. 'After all, it may be but a blessing in disguise. God sends all our trials for some good and wise purpose. Our heaviest afflictions are often, nay, most times, Koosje, means to some great end, which, while the cloud of adversity hangs over us, we are unable to discern.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305883">'Ah!' sniffed Koosje scornfully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305884">'This oaf—as I must say you justly term him, for you are a good and a clever woman, Koosje, as I can testify after the experience of years—has proved that he can be false; he has shown that he can throw away substance for shadow (for, of a truth, that poor, pretty child would make a sad wife for a poor man); yet it is better you should know it now than at some future date, when—when there might be other ties to make the knowledge more bitter to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305885">'Yes—that is true,' said Koosje, passing the back of her hand across her trembling lips. She could not shed tears over her trouble; her eyes were dry and burning, as if anger had scorched the blessed drops up ere they could fall. She went on washing up the cups and saucers, or at least <hi rend="italic">the</hi> cup and saucer, and the other articles the Professor had used for his tea; and after a few moments' silence he spoke again.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305886">'What are you going to do? Punish her, or turn her out, or what?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305887">'I shall let him—<hi rend="italic">marry</hi> her,' replied Koosje, with a portentous nod.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305888" n="543     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305889">The old gentleman couldn't help laughing. 'You think he will pay off your old scores?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305890">'Before long,' answered Koosje grimly, 'she will find him out—as I have done.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305891">Then, having finished washing the tea-things, which the Professor had shuddered to behold in her angry hands, she whirled herself out of the room, and left him alone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305892">'Oh, these women—these women!' he cried in confidence to the pictures and the skeletons. 'What a worry they are! An old bachelor has the best of it in the main, I do believe. But, oh, Jan van der Welde, what a donkey you must be to get yourself mixed up in such a broil! and yet—ah!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305893">The fossilized old gentleman broke off with a sigh as he recalled the memory of a certain dead and gone romance which had happened, goodness only knows how many years before, when he, like Jan van der Welde, would have thrown the world away for the glance of a certain pair of blue eyes, at the bidding of a certain English tongue, whose broken <hi rend="italic">Neder-landsche taal</hi> was to him the sweetest music ever heard on earth—sweeter even than the strains of the Stradivari, when from under his skilful fingers rose the perfect melodies of old masters. Ay, but the sweet eyes had been closed in death many a long, long year—the sweet voice hushed in silence. He had watched the dear life ebb away, the fire in the blue eyes fade out. He had felt each day that the clasp of the little greeting fingers was less close; each day he had seen the outline of the face grow sharper; and at last there had come one when the poor little Englishwoman met him with the gaze of one who knew him not, and babbled, not of green fields, but of horses and dogs, and of a brother Jack who, five years before, had gone down with His Majesty's ship <hi rend="italic">Alligator</hi> in mid-Atlantic.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305894">Ay, but that was many and many a year agone. His young blue-eyed love stood out alone in his life's history, a thing apart. Of the gentler sex, in a general way, the old Professor had not seen that which had raised it in his estimation to the level of the one woman over whose memory hung a bright halo of romance.</p><milestone rend="stars" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305896">Fifteen years had passed away; the old Professor of Osteology had passed away with them, and in the large house on the Domplein lived a Baron, with half a dozen noisy, happy, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305895" n="544     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>healthy children—young Fraulas and Jonkheers—who scampered up and down the marble passages, and fell headlong from top to bottom of the steep, narrow, unlighted stairways, to the immediate danger of dislocating their aristocratic little necks. There was a new race of neat maids, clad in the same neat livery of lilac and black, who scoured and cleaned just as Koosje and Dortje had done in the old Professor's day. You might, indeed, have heard the self-same names resounding through the echoing rooms, 'Koos—je! Dort—je!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305897">But the Koosje and the Dortje were not the same. What had become of Dortje I cannot say; but on the left-hand side of the busy, bustling, picturesque Oude Gracht there was a handsome shop filled with all manner of cakes, sweeties, confectioneries, and liqueurs—from absinthe to Benedictine, or arrack to Chartreuse. In that shop was a handsome, prosperous, middle-aged woman, well dressed and well mannered, no longer Professor van Dijck's Koosje, but the Jevrouw van Kampen.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305898">Yes, Koosje had come to be a prosperous tradeswoman of good position, respected by all. But she was Koosje van Kampen still; the romance which had come to so disastrous and abrupt an end had sufficed for her life. Many an offer had been made to her, it is true; but she had always declared that she had had enough of lovers—she had found out their real value.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305899">I must tell you that at the time of Jan's infidelity, after the first flush of her rage was over, Koosje disdained to show any sign of grief or regret. She was very proud, this Netherlandish servant-maid, far too proud to let those by whom she was surrounded imagine she was wearing the willow for the faithless Jan; and when Dortje, on the day of the wedding, remarked that for her part she had always considered Koosje remarkably cool on the subject of matrimony, Koosje, with a careless out-turning of her hands, palm uppermost, answered that she was right.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305900">Very soon after their marriage, Jan and his young wife left Utrecht for Arnheim, where Jan had promise of higher wages; and thus they passed, as Koosje thought, completely out of her life.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305901">'I don't wish to hear anything more about them, if—you—please,' she said severely and emphatically to Dortje.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305903">But not so. In time the Professor died, leaving Koosje the <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305902" n="545     KOOSJE: A STUDY OF DUTCH LIFE"/>large legacy with which she set up the handsome shop in the Oude Gracht; and several years passed on.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305904">It happened one day that Koosje was sitting in her shop sewing. In the large inner room a party of ladies and officers were eating cakes and drinking chocolate and liqueurs, with a good deal of fun and laughter, when the door was opened timidly, thereby letting in a gust of bitter wind, and a woman crept fearfully in, followed by two small crying children.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305905">Could the good lady give her something to eat? she asked; they had had nothing during the day, and the little ones were almost famished.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305906">Koosje, who was very charitable, lifted a tray of large plain buns, and was about to give her some, when her eyes fell upon the poor beggar's faded face, and she exclaimed:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305907">'Truide!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305908">Truide, for it was she, looked up in startled surprise.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305909">'I did not know, or I would not have come in, Koosje,' she said humbly, 'for I treated you very badly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305910">'Ve—ry bad—ly,' returned Koosje emphatically. 'Then, where is Jan?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305911">'Dead,' murmured Truide sadly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305912">'Dead! So—ah well! I suppose I must do something for you. Here, Yankje!'—opening a door, and calling 'Yankje!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305913">'Je, Jevrouw,' a voice cried in reply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305914">The next moment a maid came running into the shop.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305915">'Take these people into the kitchen and give them something to eat. Put them by the stove whilst you prepare it. There is some soup and that smoked ham we had for <hi rend="italic">koffij</hi>. Then come here and take my place for awhile.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305916">'Je, Jevrouw,' said Yankje, disappearing again, followed by Truide and her children.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305917">Then Koosje sat down again, and began to think.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305918">'I said,' she mused presently, '<hi rend="italic">that</hi> night, that the next time I fell over a bundle, I'd leave it where I found it. Ah well! I'm not a barbarian—I couldn't do that. I never thought, though, it would be Truide.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305919">'Hi, Jevrouw!' was called from the inner room.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305920">'Je, Mynheer'—jumping up and going to her customers.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305921">She attended to their wants, and presently bowed them out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305922">'I never thought it would be Truide,' she repeated to herself, as she closed the door behind the last of the gay uniforms and jingling scabbards. 'And Jan is dead—ah well!'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305923" n="546     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305924">Then she went into the kitchen, where the miserable children—girls both of them, and pretty had they been clean and less forlornly clad—were playing about the stove.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305925">'So Jan is dead?' began Koosje, seating herself.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305926">'Yes, Jan is dead,' Truide answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305927">'And he left you with nothing?' Koosje asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305928">'We had had nothing for a long time,' Truide replied in her sad, crushed voice. 'We didn't get on very well; he soon got tired of me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305929">'That was a weakness of his,' remarked Koosje dryly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305930">'We lost five little ones—one after another,' Truide continued. 'And Jan was fond of them, and somehow it seemed to sour him. As for me, I was sorry enough at the time, Heaven knows! but it was as well. But Jan said it seemed as if a curse had fallen upon us; he began to wish for you back again, and to blame me for having come between you. And then he took to <hi rend="italic">Genever</hi>, and then to wish for something stronger, so at last every stiver went for absinthe; and once or twice he beat me, and then he died.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305931">'Just as well,' muttered Koosje under her breath.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305932">'It is very good of you to have fed and warmed us,' Truide went on in her faint, complaining tones. 'Many a one would have let me starve, and I should have deserved it. It's very good of you, and we are grateful; but 'tis time we were going, Koosje and Mina'; then added, with a sad shake of her head, 'but I don't know where.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305933">'Oh, you'd better stay,' said Koosje hurriedly. 'I live in this big house by myself, and I dare say you'll be more useful in the shop than Yankje—if your tongue is as glib as it used to be, that is. You know some English, too, don't you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305934">'A little,' Truide answered eagerly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305935">'And, after all,' Koosje said, philosophically shrugging her shoulders, 'you saved me from the beatings, and the starvings, and the rest. I owe you something for that. Why, if it hadn't been for you, I should have been silly enough to have married him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305936">And then she went back to her shop, saying to herself:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305938">'The Professor said it was a blessing in disguise—God sends all our trials to work some great purpose. Yes, that was what he said, and he knew most things. Just think if I were trailing about now with those two little ones, with nothing to look back to but a schnap-drinking husband who <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305937" n="547     SCAMP!"/>beat me! Ah, well—well! Things are best as they are. I don't know that I ought not to be very much obliged to her—and she'll be very useful in the shop.'</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_261" n="14" type="story"><head>SCAMP!</head><div xml:id="jwcaval_262" n="1" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER I.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305939">'SUCH a pretty girl!' said Joe Carew to Jack Stewart, speaking of a lady who had just passed the window of the Blankhampton Club—the <hi rend="italic">gentlemen's</hi> club, as its members were particular to call it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305940">'Ye-es—of the pussy-cat type,' Jack answered slightingly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305941">'Rather like the pussy-cat type, myself,' Carew asserted for the sake of argument.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305942">'Do you? What! when they show their claws and bite the hand that strokes them?' cried Jack. 'Do you? Ah well, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> don't. No, give me a woman with eyes like a purebred colley, with all the colley's grace and strength and elegance—his strong affections—all his unswerving, splendid fidelity, and—and—oh, dash it all! take your tame pussy-cat, and keep her, but give me the colley instead.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305943">'A colley is just about the most uncertain-tempered, treacherous beast in creation!' Carew retorted; 'never two minutes in the same mind. And I'll tell you what it is, Jack, old man: you're getting positively poetic—grace, strength, elegance, strong affections, fidelity—why, man alive, nothing short of a heroine will do for you! You'll have to remain in single blessedness all your days, unless you lower your tune considerably.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305944">'Not I,' Jack laughed.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305945">'You never met a woman the least little bit like the one you've been describing,' Carew asserted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305946">'But I shall'—confidently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305947">'And then?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305948">'And then—oh, I shall marry her, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305949">Carew looked up from the depths of his big chair with an expression of intense amusement on his sunburnt face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305950">'I suppose you'll just ask her first, won't you?' he said seriously, yet smiling under his black moustache.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305952">'Ask her?' Jack echoed. 'Yes, I shall ask her, of course. <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305951" n="548     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>The woman I should make a heroine of wouldn't be one at all likely to ask me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305953">'And supposing she says "No"—what then, Jack?' Carew inquired slyly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305954">Stewart looked positively startled.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305955">'Supposing—she—says—"No,"' he repeated slowly. 'Why'—all in a hurry, as if a bright thought had suddenly occurred to him—'why, I should ask her again, to be sure. If she was worth asking the first time, depend upon it she would be worth asking the second.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305956">'And supposing she says "No" to the second time of asking?' Carew suggested.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305957">'Then I'd be all the better pleased to get her when she said "Yes" to the third,' returned Jack with a gay laugh. 'Well, I'm going into Ferguson's to look at that brown cob he mentioned yesterday. Will you come?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305958">'No, thanks; I've got a business engagement with old Drumboy at the bank.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305959">'Oh, have you? By-by, then.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305960">Carew turned his head to watch his friend and comrade leave the room, then turned it again to watch him pass with long swinging steps down the street.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305961">'That fellow'll never ask a woman twice to marry him,' he thought. 'I should say half of once asking will be enough for any woman. What a splendid unspoilt old chap it is, and what delicious ideas of t'other sex he has even yet! Ah, well, well, he'll change all those one of these fine days—see if he don't. And, for the meantime, they amuse him harmlessly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305962">Then Mr. Joe Carew, with a sigh to the memory of a certain pair of blue, blue eyes that had played what he called 'the very deuce and all' with his affections, and had then quietly given themselves to somebody else, took up his paper and studied the news until it was time for him to go and keep his business appointment with old Drumboy at the bank.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305964">In the meantime, Jack Stewart went on his pleasant way down Blankhampton High Street, his handsome blonde heat still full of his heroine—the ideal woman he had never yet met with in real life, but of whom he dreamt now and then, who was to come to him some day and be mistress of the old cradle of the Stewarts—the lovely old place away in the north, known as Langholme—a tall, gracious lady, with proud eyes, with a certain haughty dignity of manner, with a certain <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305963" n="549     SCAMP!"/>imperiousness of gesture—a woman with a brilliant gift of speech—a woman who should inspire universal admiration, yet admiration that should be mingled with respect—a woman with whom familiarity should never, not even with him, breed contempt.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305965">And yet Jack Stewart added an amendment to the act already passed in the parliament consisting of the 'Lords' of his affections and the 'Commons' of his good sense, an amendment which very materially altered the disposition of the ideal lady who was one day to be the mother of the Stewarts and the mistress of his heart. The proud eyes were always to be tender and sweet to him, to be upon occasion coaxing, to be ever brimful of deepest love. The haughty dignity of manner must always melt into tenderness and gentleness for him. The imperious gestures should only accompany such terms as, '<hi rend="italic">Don't</hi> stay away from me long,' ' Come back to me soon.' The brilliant gift of speech should not be above such simple phrases as, 'I do love you, Jack, indeed I do;' or, 'Oh, Jack dear, how glorious it is for us to be quite alone!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305966">So absorbed in his dream was he, that as he passed along the thronged street he never saw at least half a dozen ladies who looked at him—well, as ladies do look when they are prepared to bow to a man who does not see them. Jack perceived none of them; there was one plump little brunette, with a pair of soft black eyes shining from under a heavy fringe of silky hair, with whom he had danced and flirted in an unconscionable manner only three evenings before, of whom he had begged, with what certainly looked like a very eager light in his blue eyes, a flower or a glove, and had carried off both. She, of a truth, did think it odd that that handsome Mr. Stewart never saw her—after all the protestations he made, too.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305967">She had lain awake all night thinking about him, and she went on her way that winter afternoon realizing that it had all meant nothing; it had been but mere flirtation. She felt a little sore that it was so, and her heart was beating a good deal faster than she would have liked anybody-but herself to know.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305969">Jack did not notice her any more than he had noticed the others; to tell the truth, he would not have been sorry if he had been told ten minutes later how he had missed her. He had been not a little uneasy respecting that very young woman. On the morning following the Bachelors' Ball, he had opened his eyes with a feeling that something had happened, and, as <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305968" n="550     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>he collected his senses, the feeling resolved itself into something rather different—in short, that he had made a complete fool of himself. He wasn't exactly sure how, but he had an idea that a little Miss Vane or Fane, or some such name (the little brunette's real cognomen was Stamer, but Jack had forgotten), was possessed of a plump little person and a pair of big soft eyes, that, combined, had very nearly betrayed him into begging they might belong to him for the term of one of their natural lives.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305970">The feeling grew into one of positive alarm when, having dressed, he passed into his sitting-room (for at Blankhampton, as at Colchester, each officer had two little rooms to call his own), and found lying on the chimney-shelf an assortment of ball-room trophies, an assortment such as brought his heart nearly into his mouth with fright. There was a slightly-soiled pink glove, with twelve buttons and a frill of lace at the top—genuine old point it was, too; but to do Jack justice he was woefully ignorant on such matters, though Miss Stamer herself could have told him she would have to wear but a gross imitation at the next dance, or go without. There was a ball programme only half filled with names, yet of those appeared that of Miss Stamer—Miss S., Miss S., so many times that he had not the heart to count them; and besides, there was a regular bouquet of withered flowers, still exquisitely fragrant—wax-like stephanotis and gardenias. Ugh! Just then Batters appeared with his morning cup of tea and a covered plate of toast, so Jack, with a smothered groan, flung the whole concern into the fire—old point and all. Poor little Miss Stamer! She had fondly hoped the old point was put out to good interest, to be returned ere long in the shape of family diamonds and the magic circlet of gold which was to make her the mistress of Langholme. If she could but have seen the holocaust! But then, you see, she could not, and perhaps it was as well.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305971">For two whole days Jack walked about feeling a little ashamed of himself, but still in a very self-congratulatory frame of mind that he had retained sufficient sense to pull up where he did, without committing himself any further. He rather believed—at least, that was how he put it to himself—that he had kissed Miss Stamer more times than once; and as he thought matters over with a pipe, and tried to recall precisely what had taken place, he rather believed that she had not raised any objection to the proceeding.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305972" n="551     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305973">'Little baggage!' Jack said out aloud, as he knocked the ashes out against the bar of the grate, and poked a piece of blazing coal back into the fireplace with his slippered foot. 'Little baggage, I wonder how many fellows she's carried on that game with? Gad! she took to it like a young duck takes to water—little baggage!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305974">Most assuredly Miss Effie Stamer was not the realization of the ideal lady who was one day in the future to be the ruling spirit at Langholme; so, after all, it was just as well that he had passed her in the High Street, without being in the least aware that she was within a mile of him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305975">His reverie lasted until he reached the archway leading into the Repository, where hung out one Ferguson, a personage who did pretty nearly all the business in horse-flesh that was done round about that grandest of hunting centres, Blankhampton. It was there, in that unromantic spot, that his reverie came to a sudden and unexpected end; for, behold! towards him, out of the winter's gloom, there came the realization of all his dreams—his heroine—the ideal he was to ask once—twice—thrice—thirty times, if need be, to take the kingdom of his heart and his fortune, and rule them with a sceptre of love for ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305976">The realization of all his dreams! She passed him by with scarcely a look—indeed, as if he had not been there—she, the woman of whom he had thought so often, and for whom he had been looking so long. When I say with scarcely a look, I mean that her eyes just rested on him for a moment, but without any change whatever in their expression; then glanced away, as if Jack had not been there at all, and they had encountered, instead of his handsome, interested face, nothing more attractive than the dingy brick wall of the entrance to the Repository.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305977">Jack, who suddenly felt as if he had known her all his life, and that she had belonged to him always, fairly gasped as he passed her, then turned on his heel to look after her. At last he went on his way with a feeling of disappointment, vexed that, after all, he had no more idea what she was like than that she had a pair of great brown eyes, so big and so dark that they fairly dazzled him; and a tall, erect figure, clad in a tightly-fitting, yellowish ulster; while on the waves and braids of her hair rested a little cap of the same material.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305978">'Who is that lady, Ferguson?' Jack said to the horse-dealer.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305979" n="552     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305980">'I'm sure I can't tell you, Mr. Stewart,' he answered. 'That's Mr. Broome she's with.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305981">'His daughter?' said Jack carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305982">'Oh no. He's not married. Had a let-down many a lone year ago—many a long year ago.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305983">'What kind of a let-down?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305984">'A disappointment. He was engaged to a young lady—the prettiest little, soft-voiced piece of wax-work alive—and she made a clean bolt of it the night before the wedding-day, and never was heard of again. Her people were satisfied, though, that she went of her own free will. Mr. Broome was a young man then—about your age, sir—but he never was quite the same after.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305985">'I should think not,' Jack answered, thinking the while of the tall girl's dazzling brown eyes. 'And how do you happen to know all about it, Ferguson? Does everyone know about it?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305986">'Oh dear no! Mr. Broome and I come from the same village—about ten miles from here. I don't suppose anyone in Blankhampton remembers much about it—if they ever knew, for the matter of that. The whole affair was hushed up as much as possible at the time.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305987">'Oh, I see. Then you think the young lady is no relation?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305988">'I think not. Any way, she called him Mr. Broome more than once. Perhaps he's going to marry her.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305989">'To do what?' echoed Jack sharply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305990">'To marry her, I said, Mr. Stewart,' rejoined Ferguson with a laugh.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305991">'Pooh, nonsense!' the young man returned, in utter disdain.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305992">'Why, he's old enough to be her grandfather.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305993">'Mr. Broome's just sixty,' Ferguson informed him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305994">'Sixty!' From Jack's disgusted tone, Mr. Broome's age might have been a hundred and sixty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305995">'Well, sir, old gentlemen do sometimes console themselves for past troubles with a young wife; and young ladies—more's the pity—do sometimes go in for old gentlemen with plenty of money. As to this one, she's an uncommon fine, well-spoken young lady—seems an out-and-out judge of a horse for a female—and desperately keen after dogs. She's bought King, my big mastiff. I didn't want to sell him; I'd no thought of doing so; but she over-persuaded me, and made such a fuss about him, I had to give in.'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1305996" n="553     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305997">'Did you hear her name?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305998">'No, I did not, sir—not her surname, that is. Mr. Broome called her Scamp—an outlandish kind of name for a lady, it seemed to me.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1305999">Scamp! Jack Stewart walked into the nearest stable, with a sudden sensation creeping up and down and all over him that he could not define. Scamp! if anyone had suggested the word to him an hour earlier as a fit and proper name for a lady, he would have said unhesitatingly that the bearer and the giver of it must alike be semi-idiotic.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306000">Yet, after that one uninterested glance of those big brown eyes, he realized all at once that Scamp, as a lady's pet name, was simply the most musical, the most coquettish, the most dainty that was known upon earth. It is absolutely marvellous what a difference circumstances make in the cases of most people—the circumstance that Miss Scamp, whatever her name was, had looked for one instant into Jack Stewart's blue eyes, made, in his case, just all the difference in the world.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_263" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306001">'I say, Carew,' said Jack, going into his friend's quarters a couple of hours later, 'did you ever know or hear of a man called Broome?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306002">'Never heard of him,' answered Carew with decision. 'Why, what about him?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306003">'Oh, nothing in particular. He was looking at some horses at Ferguson's, that was all,' Jack replied carelessly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306004">'Did you buy the brown cob?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306005">'Yes, I did. I fancy he'll be a thoroughly useful animal,' Jack answered, wondering how he should manage to scrape acquaintance with Mr. Broome, and through him with the tall girl with the big brown eyes and the yellow-brown hair, who rejoiced in the name of Scamp.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306006">However, as it happened, he did not find the desired acquaintance very difficult to make. A few evenings later he met her at a dinner-party in the neighbourhood, and, to his immense satisfaction, was requested by his hostess to take her in to dinner.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306008">He lost no time. Before the evening was over he had learnt pretty nearly everything about her that there was to learn. Her mother was a widow, the widow of a clergyman, <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306007" n="554     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>and her father had been Mr. Broome's most intimate friend. Mr. Broome, indeed, was her godfather. They lived a short way from Southampton, three or four miles; indeed, they had enough money to live comfortably; in fact, Miss Aileen Adair—yes, that was her name, quite a poetry name, as she remarked—was sufficiently explicit as to mention the sum their income was about: it was about six hundred a year. They lived very quietly, keeping two maids and a man. They had a splendid tennis-ground, and her mother drove a Norwich car, while she rode a horse of which Mr. Broome had made her a present a couple of years before.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306009">At the conventional hour Jack Stewart went out of that house with his head in a whirl, his heart beating at twice its normal speed, and his mind made up that he would win Aileen Adair for his wife if he waited ten years before he accomplished that end.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306010">Not that Jack Stewart had the faintest ghost of an idea of waiting even as many months. Before three weeks had passed he put the question to her, quite expecting she would say, 'Yes, if you please; and thank you,' after the most approved pussy-cat style; and feeling somehow as if the world had suddenly turned upside down—his world, that is—when Miss Adair did nothing of the kind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306011">Not that she refused him—oh dear no!—but she just laughed till the tears stood in her big eyes, and chaffed him so unmercifully that he began to feel, in a crestfallen kind of way, as if he had done something especially foolish.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306012">'You and I get married?' Miss Adair cried, with a laugh. 'What a joke! Pray, Mr. Stewart, do you usually go in for buying your pigs in such very thick pokes?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306013">'You are not a pig,' asserted Jack indignantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306014">'I sincerely hope not'—laughing again. 'I was speaking metaphorically, of course.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306015">'I would rather you wouldn't speak in metaphor, then, returned Jack. 'And as to your being in a poke, literally or metaphorically—why, the idea is simply absurd.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306016">'Mr. Stewart,' said Scamp, with a great assumption or gravity, 'I ask you, what <hi rend="italic">do</hi> you know about me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306017">'Everything,' he asserted valiantly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306018">'Oh, indeed! And do you know what I like for dinner?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306019">'Well, I did notice that you took a good spoonful of sea-kale last night,' Jack replied modestly.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306020" n="555     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306021">Scamp laughed yet more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306022">'Sea-kale. Well, and what else do I take good spoonfuls of?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306023">'Oh, I don't know. What difference does that make? Of course you may always have what you like best for dinner, or anything else.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306024">'You do not know what I like for dinner—you admit it,' she said, looking at him with her big, bright brown eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306025">'Well—I like—best of—anything—<hi rend="italic">raw onions</hi>.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306026">Involuntarily Jack made a wry face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306027">'I don't believe it,' he said doughtily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306028">The laughter bubbled up to the girl's lips, but she went on with admirable gravity:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306029">'We will let the dinner question pass. Do you know what my religious views are?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306030">'I tell you I don't care,' he answered vexedly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306031">'Then I tell you, you—you ought to be ashamed of yourself. That shows you don't <hi rend="italic">really</hi> care anything about me!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306032">Jack fairly groaned.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306033">'Will you have me or not?' he demanded impatiently.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306034">'I don't think it would be wise; you are evidently very headstrong—very indifferent to anything but the merest outside qualities.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306035">'Oh!'—with a great sigh. 'Don't be hard upon me, Scamp. I love you, and I want you to love me—is not that all that can be wished? What do I care what you like for dinners? and as for your religious views, why, I don't care what they are, either. I am sure you are everything that is good, whatever your "views" may be. I don't care if you are a Plymouth Brother, or a follower of Joanna Southcott—if you are either, I'll turn so, too. But if you will only love me a little, you will make me so awfully happy, Scamp, you can't think!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306036">'Do you believe,' said Scamp with the utmost gravity, 'that a marriage would be likely to turn out well where the wife only loved her husband a little?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306037">'Then love me a great deal,' he returned promptly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306038">'I have known you just three weeks,' she reminded him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306039">'Well, is not that enough? I adored you in as many hours. Shall I wait three weeks more, and ask you again? Do you think you will love me any better then?' he demanded.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306040">'How can I tell what the state of my mind may be in three weeks' time?' she asked. 'Do be reasonable!'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306041" n="556     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306042">'May I ask you then, and see?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306043">'Oh yes, if you are in the same mind about it,' she replied, very much as she might have done if he had asked for a dance three seasons hence.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306044">Not being able to get any more definite answer from her, Jack Stewart betook himself back to barracks, and in anything but an enviable frame of mind. It had been all very well to protest that if the lady of his choice were to refuse him once, he should ask her again; and that if she refused him a second time, he should be all the better pleased when she said 'Yes' to the third; but when he came to a realization of the first stage of that interesting process, and Scamp would have next to nothing to say to him, he found it altogether a matter of very much less roseate hue.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306045">'What's the matter, Jack?' said one of the fellows to him during the evening, noting his dejected air. 'You look as if you'd lost your character.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306046">'I've lost something very much worse than my character,' returned Jack dolefully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306047">'The devil you have! Well, I'm uncommonly sorry for you. Try an extra glass of champagne—it's wonderful what a sustaining power that beverage possesses.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306048">Jack told himself that all the champagne in the world would not be of the slightest benefit to him; however, he gave the remedy a fair trial, with the result of going to bed more than half inclined to let Miss Adair—slide! And here I am using his language, not my own.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306049">But when morning-light came to bear upon the subject, he found Miss Adair <hi rend="italic">wouldn't</hi> slide—slide, not a bit of it! Oh no! the big brown eyes and the sweet smiling lips were still as persistently before him as they had been any time during the past four weeks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306050">'What's worth asking for once, is worth asking for twice,' remarked Jack to himself, as he sponged the remains of the lather off his face after shaving. ' I'll not give in. After all, she didn't actually say "No," and, dash it all! a man doesn't exactly want a wife who'll drop into his mouth like an overripe cherry!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306052">So he went headlong at the siege again, and fought right valiantly. It is true that Miss Adair would have very little to say to him—on the subject of matrimony, that is—and laughed more than ever at his efforts to make any impression upon <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306051" n="557     SCAMP!"/>her; but Jack was not, on the whole, so much discouraged as he had been aforetime—principally because his divinity had permitted him to retain her hand in his own for full five minutes, while he expatiated on the extent of his adoration, and had then only taken it away because she wanted to scratch her nose.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306053">After that he had great hopes, and each time that he found himself in her presence his love and admiration for her grew greater. He talked to her a great deal of Langholme—he sent a photographer there to take views of all the points of interest—and they were not a few; and when she graciously acknowledged that Langholme must certainly be lovely, 'a place to be happy in'—Jack's words, not hers; she never said anything half so sentimental in her life—he felt time would give him all his desires, and that the big brown eyes and smooth, yellow-brown hair would before long give his ancestral home the one touch of beauty it required.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306054">And at last Scamp accepted him—not with the faintest approach to spooniness, but, as she put it, really to get rid of his troublesome importunity. She stipulated for a year's engagement, during which time Jack was to teach her to love him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306055">Poor Jack! he had but a sorry time of it during the first three months. For a woman, Miss Adair had a wonderfully keen sense of humour. She saw everything in its most comic light, and from its most humorous point of view. No sooner did Jack's conversation or conduct border on the sentimental—and it did so very often—than the corners of her mouth would give way, and the mischievous mirth would flood into her big eyes, until he, poor fellow! over head and ears in love, and terribly in earnest, did not dare to give her a kiss or to call her by any one of the thousand terms of endearment which rose to his lips whenever he addressed her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306056">'Scamp, if you won't even give me a kiss now,' he remonstrated dismally one day, when the little imp of laughter enthroned in the girl's mischievous eyes seemed all at once to have frozen him, 'how will you——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306057">'I did not say you might not give me a kiss,' Scamp interrupted coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306058">'But you laughed at me '—in a very aggrieved tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306060">'Was it laughed at! Poor, dear baby! then it shan't be laughed at—that it shan't!'—in a soothing tone, as if he were <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306059" n="558     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>a fractions infant, troubled with what is popularly called 'teething.' 'Did its nasty, disagreeable Scamps laugh at him, then, a lartle honey!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306061">'Scamp!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306062">'Jack!'—copying his tone.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306063">'I think you are very unkind'—rising from his chair with unhappy dignity, and stalking to the window, where he stood stonily staring at nothing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306064">'Un—kind!' Scamp echoed. 'Well, of all the utterly contractious, ungrateful, and unreasonable people I ever came across, recommend me to Mr. John Stewart of the 9th Dragoons! I call you by every endearing name I can think of——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306065">'<hi rend="italic">When?</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306066">'When? Why, just now, to be sure. Didn't I call you a lartle honey?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306067">'A lartle honey!'—contemptuously.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306068">'An old-fashioned, rather countrified term, dear, but singularly soft-sounding and expressive. Then, did I not offer to give you a kiss?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306069">'WHEN?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306070">'Why, just now, of course. Why not? I'd as soon kiss you as Pug there; and I often kiss him, as you must see for yourself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306071">'Oh yes, I do! though why you should want to kiss a wheezy beast of a dog in preference to me, Heaven only knows!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306072">Well, you see, Pug is never cross; Pug does not mind <hi rend="italic">how</hi> much I laugh,' she began, when Jack interrupted her passionately.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306073">'Oh, Scamp, my darling, why do you torture me so? What is the good of making me miserable? Only tell me you really do love me, and I won't mind how much you laugh.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306074">Unfortunately, Scamp began to laugh again, and Jack went off into a greater storm of doubting passion than ever. But at last she agreed to give him a kiss by way of proving that she really did care something about him, and that the laughter was nothing but fun, and meant nothing else.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306076">Poor Jack! It was such a kiss. She screwed up her eyes and nose and mouth into a thousand creases, like a child with a wholesome horror of yellow soap. Jack declined to avail himself of the offered opportunity, and went out of the house <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306075" n="559     SCAMP!"/>in a regular rage, without so much as going through the form of saying good-bye, whereat that wicked Scamp laughed longer and more mischievously than ever.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306077">And Jack went to barracks in such a towering rage that he even went the length of writing a formal—very formal—letter, resigning all claim to Miss Adair's hand, and subscribing it:</p><q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306078">'I have the honour to be,
<lb/>'Your obedient servant,
<lb/>'JOHN STEWART'.</p></q><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306079">It was a very serious epistle, for he pointed out that she evidently cared nothing for him, but found him merely an object of ridicule, and that he had come to the conclusion that a marriage between them would not have a chance of proving conducive to their mutual comfort and happiness.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306080">But Scamp never saw that letter, for the very good reason that Jack never sent it. When the post-corporal was ready to take the bag, Jack thought it would be as well to sleep on the matter; and by the time morning arrived Scamp was in the ascendancy, rage was nowhere, and Jack had a dozen excuses ready to extenuate the conduct which twelve hours previously he had termed heartless, and to exalt it from careless unkindness into sweet maidenly modesty.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306081">So the game was played on, and weeks slipped by. Scamp laughed more gaily, and Jack fell deeper and deeper in love; and then a billet-doux was received in Blankhampton Barracks which stifled the laughter and turned the love for a time to despair—a billet-doux the gist of which was orders to embark for South Africa within forty-eight hours.</p></div><div xml:id="jwcaval_264" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306082">I HAVE not explained, as I ought to have done, that during all this time Mrs. and Miss Adair were staying with Mr. Broome and his sister. Such, however, was the case. They frequently paid these long visits at Friar's Lodge, for Mrs. Adair and Miss Broome had been close friends from childhood, and Mr. Broome liked to have his old friend's daughter about him whenever he could.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306084">Almost every afternoon, unless Scamp happened to be in Blankhampton, Jack Stewart was accustomed to ride over, Mr. Broome's house being about five miles from the town. It was, therefore, with some surprise that the family, who had <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306083" n="560     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>not yet left the luncheon-table, saw him ride past the dining-room windows fully an hour and a half before his usual time, his horse in a lather, and news of importance as plainly stamped upon his face as if it had been written there with pen and ink.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306085">'Why, Stewart, you are early to-day!' Mr. Broome exclaimed, when he entered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306086">'Yes, I am, Mr. Broome,' he answered. 'Scamp, will you come into the drawing-room for a minute? I want to speak to you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306087">Scamp rose without a word, and followed him out of the room; her heart was beating furiously, and she feared she knew not what.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306088">'What is it, Jack?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306089">Jack drew her into the drawing-room, and closed the door.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306090">'I've got to go away and leave you, Scamp,' he blurted out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306091">'To—go—away—and leave me,' Scamp echoed, half laughing. 'Why, what in the world have I done now?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306092">'Done? Nothing, of course. What could you <hi rend="italic">ever</hi> do that would drive me away from you?' he asked passionately.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306093">'But you are going away?'—never guessing at the truth.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306094">'My duty bids me go, Scamp.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306095">'Jack!'—knowing all at once what he meant. ' It is <hi rend="italic">not</hi> foreign service?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306096">'It is South Africa,' Jack answered, ' and we are off this evening.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306097">He thought, in his heart, that she did not care very much, and so he troubled her with none of the doubting questions she had laughed at so persistently during three months—questions which, just then, would have been absolute torment to her. Besides, he had many things to tell her and very little time to tell them in, for there was still much to be done, and many matters of outfit to be procured before the regiment should march out of Blankhampton Barracks.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306098">His small stock of personal jewellery he had brought with him to leave in her care—a valuable watch and chain, a set diamond studs, and a set of sapphires, three or four rings, and as many breast-pins.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306099">'I shall buy a silver watch and chain as I go through the town,' he told her. 'If I should happen to be killed—and it's not in the least improbable—it's no good enriching those Zulu brutes more than one can help.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306100">'No,' said Scamp, in a frozen voice.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306101" n="561     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306102">Something in the tone caused him to look at her, and something in the face made him ask a question, or, rather, make an assertion.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306103">'Oh, Scamp!' he cried. 'I believe you do really care—a little.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306104">'A <hi rend="italic">little!</hi>' Scamp repeated. 'Oh, my Jack!'</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306105">Nearly a year passed before Jack Stewart returned to the land of his birth; and when he did so, it was with a heavy, heavy heart, that would fain have kept him in Africa.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306106">A very short time before the battle of Ulundi he had been grievously wounded—in truth, he had been within an ace of losing his life, and it was only by the cool, determined, unyielding pluck of a brother officer—Joe Carew, by-the-bye—who had pulled him on to his horse when half a dozen Zulus were fast pressing on them, and the blood was pouring down over Jack's eyes so that he could not see where he was and hardly knew what he was doing. Twice he missed the stirrup, but Joe pulled him up at last, with a savage determination that the Zulus should not have his friend, dead or alive—and so he saved him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306107">Carew was to have the Cross, and Jack had thanked him with his lips, while in his heart he wished many and many a time that Joe had left him to his fate, and that a respectable Gazette had been issued—<hi rend="italic">vice John Stewart, killed in action</hi>.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306108">My readers will infer from this that Scamp had proved traitor. Not a bit of it. By every mail there came long and bright letters, detailing every scrap of London and Blankhampton gossip she could pick up; and if they contained no spooniness from beginning to end, they invariably wound up in a way which, to a man who knew her as well as Jack Stewart did, ought to have been eminently satisfactory.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306109">'God bless you, my Jack! I pray for your safety every day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306111">But the matter was just this: Jack wasn't satisfied. In spite of numerous protestations to the contrary, he would have liked regular pussy-cat letters from Scamp, though a girl of the pussy-cat type would, in the first instance, have had no attraction for him whatever. The brilliant, cool, well-bred letters gave him the impression that she cared nothing at all about him, and quite did away with the impression made by her piteous exclamation of 'Oh, my Jack!' which had <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306110" n="562     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>comforted him so inexpressibly when they parted. The longer he remained in Africa, the more the idea took hold of him, and the more dejected and miserable did he grow; until there came a day when he came slowly and painfully back to life, after many hours of insensibility, and made up his mind that he must give Scamp her freedom.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306112">Fain would he have stayed in Africa, where he knew his sufferings would soon come to an end; but, you see, military authorities don't always ask their invalids whether they will or they won't do what is good for them. Captain John Stewart was carried off, bag and baggage, by half a dozen stalwart soldiers, and popped on board a homeward-bound steamer, without having his likes or dislikes on the subject consulted.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306113">It was not, however, because he fancied Scamp cared very little about him that he resolved to give her up. I have said that previous to the fight at Ulundi he was seriously wounded, but I did not say that perhaps no man was ever so grievously wounded before. In the first place, he had had a bullet in his thigh, which had shattered the bone, and would make him limp for life—but that was as nothing; a sword-cut—as was afterwards proved, a sword belonging to one of the ill-fated victims of the ever-to-be-lamented Isandula massacrehad—had laid open his face from temple to jaw, blinding an eye, breaking his handsome aquiline nose, and leaving a broad seam of flaming crimson right across the cheek which had once been the fairest of complexion in the regiment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306114">Poor Jack! the first time—it was during that miserable homeward voyage—that he cajoled his servant into giving him a looking-glass, that he might see what manner of man he had come to be, from that moment he had given Aileen Adair up as completely as if she were dead.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306115">'What woman would be willing to run the risk of sitting opposite to such a Mokanna as that for, it might be, thirty or forty years?' he muttered as he laid the glass down.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306116">So, when he reached Netley, he told the surgeon under whose especial care he was, and with whom he struck up a tremendous friendship, that if any people came to see him, they were not to be let in.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306117">'All right,' said the doctor, guessing something of his feelings. 'Poor chap, it must have been a hard trial to have his face smashed in that way!' Dr. Gordon said to himself.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306118" n="563     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306119">However, he was not a little surprised when, that very afternoon, a smart Norwich car containing two ladies, one of them young and fair to see, was driven up, and inquiries for Captain Stewart were made.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306120">'Oh! I'll go out myself,' he said to the orderly, who had come in with the message.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306121">So he went out bareheaded, and Scamp took him captive by one single glance of her big eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306122">'Mr.——I mean Captain Stewart has come,' she said. 'Is he to be seen?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306123">Evidently, thought the doctor, she had no idea how bad matters were with him.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306124">'I have orders to admit no visitors,' he answered, wondering, as he regarded her, what the upshot of it all would be.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306125">'Oh, from whom? Is he very ill? Too ill to see me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306126">'He is very ill—very ill indeed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306127">'Too ill to be seen?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306128">'Well, no, I cannot say that; but he is excessively weak, and in wretchedly low spirits, and I have promised him that no visitors shall see him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306129">'That no visitors shall see him?' repeated Scamp in the blankest possible tones. ' Why, he must have <hi rend="italic">known</hi> we should come the moment we heard of his arrival.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306130">'You are his sister, perhaps?' said the doctor, knowing very well that she was nothing of the kind.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306131">'Oh no; I am engaged to him.' Then, with a sudden gleam of humour shining through the blank distress on her face, she said: 'We had better go away, mother; it is evident that Jack wants to be off it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306132">The doctor laughed outright.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306133">'I expect the real truth is, he is <hi rend="italic">afraid</hi> to let you see him,' he told her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306134">'Why? He is not altered, is he?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306135">'Altered!' he echoed—he just stood and stared at her. 'My dear lady, he is disfigured frightfully,' he said, at length. ' He told me this morning so bitterly that I guessed there was a lady in the case—that he was good-looking once——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306136">'I should think he was!' Scamp interrupted indignantly, ' as handsome as anyone you ever saw.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306137">'He is not good-looking now,' said the surgeon pitifully.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306139">'Jack not good-looking!' Scamp cried. 'Well, Mr.—oh! Gordon, thanks-well, Mr. Gordon, I think you had better <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306138" n="564     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>break your promise and show me the way to his room, I'll take the blame, and make it all right for you. Is he in bed or up—or what? Can he get about?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306140">'Not as yet; he is on a sofa. He might move about as far as the wounds in his head are concerned; but, unfortunately poor fellow! he has had a ball in his hip, which will make him limp for the rest of his life.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306141">Miss Adair uttered a cry of dismay.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306142">'I can't think of Jack like that,' she said, dashing the tears resolutely away from her eyes.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306143">'So Captain Stewart seems to think,' said the doctor dryly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306144">Scamp looked aside at him, then threw the reins to the groom, and jumped out of the car.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306145">'You'll show me the way, won't you?' she said to the doctor in her most persuasive accents.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306146">But the doctor was not inclined to have his patient distressed for nothing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306147">'Have you come to do him good?' he asked gravely; ' because otherwise I cannot let you see him.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306148">'Mr. Gordon,' said she, 'look at me—look at me well. Do you think there is anything mean about me?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306149">'No, I don't; but you have no idea how disfigured——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306150">'Do you think I look like a cad——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306151">'Scamp!' interrupted her mother reproachfully; 'my dear!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306152">'I couldn't help crying a little bit,' the girl went on, upset by the reproachful tones, 'because it is not a year since Jack went away the very picture of health and beauty too'—with a defiant ring in her voice, ' and it does seem hard he should come back——but there, I won't talk about it. I only say, if—<hi rend="italic">whatever</hi> he may look like, if it made any difference in me, I should be a cad! Yes, mother, I will say the word, a <hi rend="italic">howling cad-there!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306153">I am bound to own that a great big lump, very embarrassing and awkward, came into the doctor's throat. It very nearly choked him, when he made an effort and swallowed it.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306154">'You'll do,' he said admiringly; 'come along.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306155">He was very sorry for her, for he saw how little she realized the extent of the disfigurement from which Jack Stewart suffered. However, he led her into the hospital, and, opening the door of a pleasant little room, stood aside that she might pass in alone.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306156" n="565     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306157">For a moment the girl's heart positively stood still, as she saw the face that was turned towards her; then by a mighty effort she pulled herself together, and said coolly:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306158">'Well, upon my word, darling! but they have made a mess of you—no mistake about it.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306159">Jack turned his head away in silence, and Scamp crossed the room to his side, looking down with sad and pitying eyes upon the scarred cheek, down which great tears were fast streaming. She felt as if the doctor had been chaffing when he spoke of Jack as being frightfully disfigured. Disfigured! why, he was changed and altered out of all recognition; if she had met him in the street, she knew that she would have passed him by without recognition. She saw no resemblance to the Jack Stewart she had known.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306160">Gaunt and weak and pale, with a short beard covering the lower part of his face, and that cruel scar—she couldn't bear to think of it when she recalled the splendid man, in the very flower of his youth, who had come back to her this pitiable wreck.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306161">'Jack, have you nothing to say to me?' she said, as he still kept his head turned from her.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306162">'I told Gordon not to let you in,' he replied in a trembling voice.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306163">'Ah '—and here she tried to laugh—' but you see, Jack, I made eyes at him, and he succumbed.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306164">'Oh, of course, I might have expected it'—very bitterly. 'What chance would <hi rend="italic">my</hi> face have against yours?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306165">'Did you not want me to come?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306166">'I wanted to spare you this'—mistaking the passionate entreaty in her tone altogether.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306167">'But I must have seen you some time,' she remonstrated.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306168">'Not necessarily.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306169">'Jack, <hi rend="italic">you can't</hi> have seen anyone out there?' she cried. 'Jack, you are <hi rend="italic">not</hi> changed!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306170">'Not changed,' he echoed, turning his face to her again—'not changed! Oh, my God-<hi rend="italic">look</hi> at me!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306171">In an instant Scamp—the teasing, distant, mischievous creature, who had almost worried his soul out of him—perched herself upon the arm of his chair, and, slipping her arm round his neck, laid her soft, young, blooming cheek against his burning, scarred face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306173">'My Jack,' she said tenderly, 'were you going to give me <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306172" n="566     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>up because those miserable savages have spoilt your beauty? Did you think that would make me change?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306174">Jack tried to push her away.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306175">'I will not be married for pity—I cannot bear it!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306176">'Dear love,' she said in her soft, gentle voice, ' there is no pity in the case—only love. You gave me your heart when your face was handsome—I never saw a handsomer—and your frame strong. Do you think I shall value your heart less because of your limp and your scarred face? My Jack, you know very little of women, and still less of your Scamp, when you believe such a thing possible.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306177">'And you really love me, Scamp?' he cried. 'I have thought all along that——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306178">'Then, you had no business to think. I tell you I do—I do—I do—dearly—dearly—dearly! There, will that satisfy you? And here's the doctor, come to turn me out. Do you think I have done your patient good?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306179">'Yes—you have done him good; we shall soon be rid of him,' he answered.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306180">'I hope you will, for he must come to us to be nursed up,' said Scamp, looking round with superb disdain. 'I don't believe in nursing by wholesale, myself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306181">'Pray be civil, Scamp' put in Jack, who had recovered himself so far as to meet his future mother-in-law's kiss of greeting with a smile, ' or Dr. Gordon will keep me here for a month longer, just to punish you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306182">'I'm sure I hope you won't!' cried Mrs. Adair, in feigned alarm. 'I want to be at peace now that our hero has come back. The last year, my daughter has done nothing but watch the gate for the postman and the newspapers—unless, indeed, she happened to be galloping into the town on the chance of there being a telegram.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306183">'When <hi rend="italic">I</hi> was young,' observed Scamp, folding her hands primly, and looking at nothing, 'I was taught that it was excessively mean to tell tales out of school.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306184">'I thought Jack might appreciate the compliment,' said her mother, laughing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306185">'Jack does,' said the invalid.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306186">Then the doctor turned them out.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306187">'He has had excitement enough,' he told Scamp, as they reached the open air once more.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306188">'But we may come to-morrow?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306189" n="567     SCAMP!"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306190">'Oh yes! You've done him no end of good, poor fellow! he'll get well in no time now.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306191">'I tried my best to keep her out,' he said to Jack, when he returned to his patient's room, 'but it was no use; she wouldn't take "No," so I had to give in.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306192">Jack turned round smiling.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306193">'Gordon,' he said, 'isn't she a darling?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306194">'Yes,' said Gordon, laughing.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306195">'This morning there wasn't a more miserable devil in the three kingdoms than I; now'—heaving a long sigh of satisfaction—'I would not change places with any king that ever sat upon a throne.'</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306196">It was a few weeks later that the gallant 9th came back to England.

'How do you do, Mrs. Stewart? Many congratulations!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306199">'Thanks. Welcome home a thousand times; and as many thanks for sending me my husband safe back, and for all the care you took of him out there.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306200">'I wish I could have sent him home in a better state of preservation'—looking up at his friend. 'But he doesn't look nearly so bad as he did.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306201">Scamp leant out of the little carriage, and gave the sunburnt soldier's hand a grateful squeeze.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306202">'Yes; they have spoilt his beauty-looks,' she admitted; 'but, you see, I was so thankful to get him back at all, that I never gave "condition" a second thought.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306203">Carew looked past her to Jack.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306204">'Jack,' he said solemnly, 'I think you were quite right to prefer colleys to cats. A pussy-cat won't compare for a moment with a colley.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306205">'Colleys—cats! What do you mean?' Scamp asked, wondering why Jack laughed so consciously. 'Did anyone ever compare me to a cat?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306206">'Never in my hearing, Mrs. Stewart,' said Carew with a laugh, as he moved off.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306207">'What does he mean, Jack?' she asked.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306208">But Jack was graceless enough to declare that he hadn't the least idea.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306209" n="568     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><div xml:id="jwcaval_266" n="15" type="story"><head>A REGIMENTAL ÆSTHETE.</head><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306210">'NEW sub comes to-day, I suppose.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306211">'Yes.

' I don't know that it would be desirable—must be some hewers of wood and drawers of water; only somehow they ought to keep out of a regiment—or, at least, go into the Line.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306216">'Well, don't let the chief come in and hear you,' put in Gordon. 'We shall have him jawing on the subject for a month.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306217">'No,' cried D'Arcy, joining in the general laugh. ' No use flaunting a red flag before a bull, particularly when the bull is mad on the subject of red rags, and you've no special reason for rousing him. It's an odd thing, though—a deuced odd thing'—puffing out a great cloud of smoke, and watching it mount slowly into the air—' that a man with such an utter absence of breed as the chief should be so ultra-select in his company.

'One, two, three, four, five cabs! Good Lord! and a furniture-van! Now, what the devil can he be bringing in a furniture-van?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306223">'By George, there's another!' cried Jerrards. 'Does he expect he's going to have all the barracks to himself?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306224" n="569     A REGIMENTAL ÆSTHETE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306225">The first cab, as he spoke, drew up to the door of the anteroom, whereupon several officers trooped out to inspect the new arrival.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306226">He alighted immediately—a tall, limp youth, whose carroty hair flowed in lank waves on either side of his head to his shoulders; whose large-featured, clean-shaven face was wan and sad, and of a chalk-like hue; under whose eyes were great hollow dark lines, which made the dark orbs blacker and more profoundly melancholy than probably they would have been had their owner looked alert and lively.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306227">He wore a short velvet jacket, without buttons, and fastened at the throat by a double-jewelled clasp; he had a wide collar, like an exaggerated Eton boy with a bad laundress and a poor supply of starch; on his fingers were many and strange rings; on his left wrist a bracelet—a broad band of gold, bearing in raised and burnished Old English characters this inscription:
<q><l>'For our Eadye of Pain.'</l></q>
On his untidy head was a huge felt hat, of the size, shape, and that degree of softness much affected by the masters of the earlier Flemish school of paintings, or by itinerant musicians of Southern nationality in more modern days.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306228">Thus the new subaltern presented himself to the astonished officers of the 9th Dragoons. They were astonished, certainly. As for D'Arcy—who, for cool cheek and unabashed impudence, was considered the showman of the regiment—he was thoroughly taken aback; he stood stock-still, staring at him, as if he had been suddenly frozen to ice—perhaps for the very first time in the whole course of his existence (five-and-twenty years of it) he was in the plight of being absolutely without anything to say for himself; in truth, he just stood and gaped as if he had been a chicken with the pip.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306229">At last, however, having rubbed his eyes to make sure that he was awake and not dreaming, he did find his tongue, and blurted out:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306230">'What the devil will the Colonel say?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306231">Hearing him speak, though he had evidently not caught the words, the tall, chalk-coloured youth addressed himself to him:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306232">'Are you,' he said, in a voice like an echo of some mournful melody—'are you one of my future comrades-in-arms?'</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306233" n="570     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306234">One of the bystanders went off into a fit of laughter, but D'Arcy was too thoroughly astonished even to smile.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306235">'My name is D'Arcy, and I am a Lieutenant in the 9th Dragoons, if that's what you mean,' he said brusquely. 'I suppose you're Mr. Smith?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306236">The mournful one passed a beringed hand across his eyes, and a spasm—I suppose of pain—flickered across his gaunt face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306237">'May I beg '—shivering slightly—' that you will give me my <hi rend="italic">full</hi> name—as the greatest favour. Ah, thanks!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306238">'Hey?' said D'Arcy, puzzled, and beginning to get cross.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306239">'My <hi rend="italic">full</hi> name—Plantagenet de Montmorency-Smith—ah, thanks!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306240">'Well, you'd better come into the anteroom, Mr. Plantagenet de Montmorency-Smith,' put in Gordon, with a good-natured laugh, as he would have done if he had suddenly had a hopeless imbecile thrown on his hands. 'You're just in time for lunch. Colonel Graves has gone home, so you cannot report yourself to him at present. The Major is hunting to-day.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306241">'Ah, thanks!' murmured the æsthetic imbecile feebly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306242">'But those cabs must be emptied,' Gordon went on. ' Bolton—hi—Bol—ton!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306243">'Yes, sir,' was responded from above, and immediately a servant came running from the officers' quarters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306244">'Do you know who is told off to Mr. Smith?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306245">'Yes, sir. Wilkins, sir, for the present.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306246">'Then, get those cabs cleared, and help him to take Mr. Smith's things up to his room. But—er—Smith, by-the-bye, what—er—I beg your pardon,' for the youth had sent a quivering, despairing hand very nearly into Gordon's astonished face.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306247">'My <hi rend="italic">full</hi> name—the greatest favour—Plantagenet de Montmorency-Smith—ah, thanks!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306248">'Oh, devil take your "Plantagenet de Montmorency "!' muttered Gordon.

'Some future day I will endeavour to explain all the beauties——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306255">'O Lord!' ejaculated Jerrards blankly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306256">'Well, never mind that,' put in Gordon, who wanted his lunch, instead of a disquisition on art, good, bad, or indifferent. 'The question is, what is to be done with those vans? Are they full?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306257">'Quite so,' answered P. de M.-Smith serenely. 'Full of rare and priceless treasures—broidered stuffs from Mecca, portières from Cashmere, perfumes from Araby, enamels from Limoges, curios from the East, pottery——'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306258">'Well, they'll soon get smashed among soldier-servants and railway-porters—that's one comfort,' said Gordon unfeelingly. 'But where are they to go for the present? You know you will only have one room here, fourteen feet by sixteen, if as large.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306259">'Let the horses be unyoked, and they can remain for the present. I must have chambers in the town,' said the youth with a superb air.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306260">'Well, the Colonel'll settle that question,' said Gordon. 'Then, Wilkins, just look after them, will you?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306261">'Yes, sir,' answered Wilkins, who had been staring with all his eyes at his new master, and now went off sniggering audibly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306262">'Am I to be afflicted with a servant called Wilkins?' asked Mr. P. de M.-Smith plaintively. 'My own servants are coming; Isidore will arrive with the remainder of my luggage shortly.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306263">,'Oh, Wilkins isn't a bad name,' said St. George brusquely, speaking for the first time. 'You'll soon get used to it. If not, there's the Honourable Reginald Gonerille in my troop; perhaps he'd suit you better, only here he's called Tom Brown, and I don't know that he would accept a post as servant.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306264">'Ah, thanks!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306266">St. George muttered something savagely about an idiot, with an adjective tacked on to the term, which I need not repeat; it was utterly thrown away on the melancholy youth, who had put himself into a three-cornered attitude against <pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306265" n="572     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/>the wall, while his sad eyes contemplated his new surroundings with a gaze so utterly and profoundly hopeless, that it would have touched the heart of anyone but a Philistine of a cavalry officer.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306267">'Mr. Smith, said Gordon loudly, 'won't you take your hat off, and come to the table?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306268">Mr. Smith cast his shapeless hat upon the ground.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306269">'Pray pardon me; I was in a reverie,' he said simply.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306270">'Looks queerer without his hat than he does with it', muttered D'Arcy to Jerrards.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306271">'Infinitely. I say, D'Arcy, he's taken all the shine out of you!'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306272">'By Jove, you're right,' returned D'Arcy. 'I never saw such a brute in my life; and I can't think what the devil the Colonel will say.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306273">'Not the usual "Very glad to see you,"' Jerrards laughed. 'By Jove! but I'll take care to be present at the meeting; I wouldn't miss it for a fiver.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306274">Mr. Smith certainly did look very queer without his hat. His carroty hair was as thick as a mop, was parted precisely in the middle, coming down to his eyebrows and over his ears. He was leaning back in his chair, apparently lost in another reverie, out of which he roused himself with a slow coming back to life, when he was distinctly addressed by one of the mess-waiters.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306275">'It is but little I want,' he said, waving him away. 'I need it not, minion.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306276">The man stared at him in speechless astonishment, and the youth continued:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306277">'Give me some fair water.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306278">'I shouldn't wonder if this don't turn the Colonel into a drivelling idiot,' muttered D'Arcy confidently to Jerrards. 'Only the other day Scott said shocks were bad for him. Depend upon it, he'll never get over this.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306279">'Won't you eat anything?' said Gordon to 'the shock' at at that moment.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306280">'It is but little I want,' answered he.
<q><l>'But I wants it reg'lar,</l><l>And I wants it strong,'</l></q>
said D'Arcy, all at once finding sufficient wit to quote and improvise at the same time.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306281" n="573     A REGIMENTAL ÆSTHETE"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306282">'The shock ' closed his eyes with a shudder of pain, in the midst of which Jerrards exclaimed:</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306283">'There's a couple more cabs coming.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306284">'Isidore,' murmured 'the shock' feebly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306285">'Isidore's a d——d sight smarter-looking chap than his master,' Jerrards said <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi> to his neighbours.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306286">A moment later a mess-waiter entered, and made a communication to Gordon.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306287">'Mr. Smith, sir, has come to join.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306288">Gordon rose, and went into the anteroom with a puzzled face. 'The shock' was deep in a reverie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306289">'We've got one Mr. Smith,' they heard him say to the new arrival. 'Why, how d'you do? You're little Ted Smith, of Chorley Manor—knew the face in a minute. Then, who the devil's the other fellow?'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306290">'What's he like? I should look after the spoons, if I were you.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306291">'Well, come in and have a look at him,' Gordon said cordially. 'Come in; gentlemen, let me introduce Mr. Smith, new subaltern—old friend and neighbour of mine.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306292">There was a general greeting, except from ' the shock,' who did not look up, but was still sunk in his reverie.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306293">'By the way, Mis-ter—Plan-tag-e-net <hi rend="italic">de</hi> Mont-mor-ency-<hi rend="italic">Smith!</hi>'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306294">'My friend '—looking up dreamily.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306295">'I think you informed us you had come to join the 9th Dragoons.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306296">Not a muscle of the gaunt face moved; the gaze of the melancholy eyes never wavered. At last he spoke.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306297">'Why, cert'nly,' he said coolly.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306298">There was a regular yell of laughter from every man round the table, waiters and all.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306299">'It's Tottles,' screamed Jerrards, snatching at the carroty wig.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306300">'What an ass you are, Tottles!' cried one.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306301">'What a splendid get-up!' laughed another.</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306302">'I think I took you in, you fellows,' Tottles laughed. 'It was an awful lot of trouble, but D'Arcy's face alone was worth all the bother. By George, it was inimitable when he blurted out, "What the devil will the Colonel say?" I'll be shot if he had a word to say for himself.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306303">But D'Arcy's tongue had come back to him.</p><pb xml:id="jwcaval_1306304" n="574     REGIMENTAL LEGENDS"/><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306305">'I always thought you were rather good-looking, Tottles,' he said coolly; 'but without your moustache, and <hi rend="italic">with</hi> a carrot-coloured wig, you're simply hideous.'</p><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306306">'I believe I am,' Tottles admitted; 'but your face, my friend, was what the æsthetic people would describe as <hi rend="italic">distinctly precious</hi>.'</p><trailer>THE END.</trailer></div></body></text></group><back xml:id="jwcaval_12038"><div xml:id="jwcaval_821" type="colophon"><p xml:id="jwcaval_1306307">BILLING AND SONS, PRINTERS, GUILFORD.</p></div></back></text></TEI>
