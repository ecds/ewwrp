She entered Galloway Woman's College, where for two years she was elected ranking student in the college, and was graduated  in  1920 with the A.B. degree.  In 1921 she was graduated from Columbia University with the A.M. degree.  She then began her teaching career, spending the years 1921-23 at St. Mary's School in Memphis, Tennessee, as teacher of Latin and English; the year 1923-24 at Henderson-Brown College, instructing freshmen and sophomores in English; the years 1924-26 at Grenada College as head of the English department; and the years 1926-29, again instructing freshmen and some upper classmen, at the University of Missouri.  In February, 1930, she began definite work  for  the degree of Doctor of Philosophy at Cornell University, where she has been elected to Pi Lambda Theta and Phi Kappa Phi.  For the year 1931-32  she was appointed to the Graduate Scholarship in English, and she was also awarded the annual Fellowship of the Yardley Foundation, sponsored by the New Jersey State Federation of Women's Clubs.  For the year 1932-33 she has been awarded the Margaret E. Waltby Fellowship of the American Association of University Women for the purpose of study in England.</p></div><pb xml:id="hughey_1308" n="[iii]"/><div xml:id="hughey_02" type="acknowledgments"><head>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</head><p xml:id="hughey_1309">To Professor J. Q. Adams, with whom I first began my graduate study at Cornell  University, I am deeply indebted for arousing my interest in Elizabethan literature by his stimulating  exposition of the period; and to Professor J.W. Hebel, who has assumed direction of my work since  Professor Adams' departure, I am grateful for valuable advice and discriminating suggestions in the preparation of this study.  Without the assistance of Professor F. G. Marcham my investigation of Tudor and Stuart women would scarcely have been possible.  Through consultation with him the study was first shaped into a definite problem.  He has been generous in his encouragement and equally generous in allowing me the use of rotographs made from manuscripts in the British Museum and  of a photo static copy of a rare book in the Huntington Library.  To the criticism of Professor F. C. Prescott I owe not only the improvement of many stylistic details in the thesis but also an increased appreciation for the significance of words.  I hold myself fortunate in having worked also with Professor M. W. Sampson, who made poetry an inspiring reality for his students.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13010">I wish to thank my friend Dr. Mary F. Tenney for assistance in the citing of certain Latin and Greek quotations.</p></div><pb xml:id="hughey_13011" n="[iv]"/><div xml:id="hughey_03" type="preface"><head>Preface</head><p xml:id="hughey_13012">For making a survey of the cultural interests of women in England from 1524 to 1640 as those interests are revealed in the writings of the women, no apology is needed.  The field has been lightly dismissed by scholars.   Little effort has been made to investigate the amount of writing done, the types represented, and the influences stimulating, or conversely, repressing the expression of thought and  emotion. Without such an investigation a history of cultural development  among Tudor and Stuart women is impossible.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13014">Single studies have appeared of a few women, for example, of Mary,
Countess of Pembroke, of Lady Anne Clifford, and, of course, of the
royal women, although even these have failed to reveal the full
significance of intellectual pursuits.  Twentieth-century interest in
the education of English women in the sixteenth century began with
Mrs. C. C. Stopes.  Her chapter in <title>Shakespeare's
Environment</title> (1904) on "Women Students," apparently gleaned
largely from the eighteenth-century <title>Memoirs of Several Ladies
of Great Britain</title> by George Ballard, suggests briefly the vast
possibilities for investigation.  In 1912 Foster Watson published
<title>Vives <pb xml:id="hughey_13013" n="v"/>and the Renascence Education of Women</title>,
with enlightening introduction.  His concern, however, was chiefly
with contemporary essays on the education of women and with a few
women exemplifying in their achievements the practical application of
these ideas.  The 1929 edition of <title>English Girlhood at
School</title> by Dorothy Gardiner, devoting several detailed chapters
to the education of sixteenth and seventeenth-century girls, presented
for the first time the history of education among girls of the middle
class, adding, at the same time, many illuminating points about the
training given noblewomen.  The unpublished thesis by Dorothy Meads on
<title>The Education of Women and Girls under the Tudors</title>
(1929) would also, without doubt, if available, contribute valuable
information.  Louis B. Wright in "The Reading of Renaissance English
Women" (Studies in Philology, vol. xxviii, 1931) suggests what is to
be investigated rather than what can be determined.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13016">Conclusions concerning cultural interest drawn from the writings of
the women may not be, and probably are not, completely representative
of all interests.   Nevertheless, the writings of the women should
furnish more accurate sources for their cul-<pb xml:id="hughey_13015" n="vi"/>tural history
than dedicatory addresses to them or references about them in
literature by men.  Obviously, all sources should be considered in any
attempt at a complete understanding of their lives.  Too much
emphasis, I believe, has been placed upon the large number of
dedications penned by poets, playwrights, and every other writer to
women.  Without doubt many of these have little interpretative value
other than that of personal admiration or, perhaps, desire for some
reward.  Their complete significance, however, would form a separate
study, for certainly some women were influential patronesses of literature.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13017">I have selected as the first inclusive date of the survey 1524, the year of the publication of Margaret More's translation of the treatise on the <title>Pater  Noster</title> by Erasmus, believing that to be significant in showing definite influence of the Renaissance.  Moreover, in her, possibly to a greater degree than in any other woman of the period, the ideals for feminine education advanced by humanistic scholars were realized.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13019">The date 1640, introducing the decade of the Civil War, is commonly
accepted as a line of demarca-<pb xml:id="hughey_13018" n="vii"/>tion between different types of interests and influences.  Without doubt, women developed remarkably during and after the Civil War.  But, of course, lines of demarcation are necessary evils -- always dangerous.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13021">In making my investigation of the writings of women in England
between 1524 and 1640, I have necessarily been forced to make certain
limitations.  I have endeavored to make the history of the printed
matter complete in the sense that I have tried to ferret out the title
of every piece published by women; but I am forced to say only that I
hope I have succeeded; I cannot be sure.  I have used as guides
<title>A Short-Title Catalogue of Books Printed in England, Scotland,
and Ireland and of English Books Printed Abroad 1475-1640</title>,
compiled by A. W. Pollard and R. G. Redgrave and others (designated in
the footnotes as <title>S. T. C.</title>); <title>A Transcript of the
Registers of the Company of Stationers of London 1554-1640</title>,
edited by Edward Arber; <title>Bibliographical Collections and
Notes</title>, compiled by W. C. Hazlitt.  In addition I have examined
all minor cataloguers, such as Corser, Brydges, Walpole, Park, Ritson,
Jacob, Phillips, Duff, etc.  As a matter of course I have used
publications <pb xml:id="hughey_13020" n="viii"/>of learned societies.  The publications of
the Parker Society have been especially helpful because of the many
religious writings.  I have made it a point to indicate whether books
are available either in the original form or in reprint, and whether
they were entered on the <title>Registers</title> after 1554.  Many of
the printed books are extant only in rare copies, and reprints are often to be had only in excerpt.  As might be expected some of the books have been lost.  I have been so fortunate as to have a photostatic copy of the 1605 edition of Elizabeth Grymeston's <title>Miscellanea</title>, made from the original in the Huntington Library.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13022">The chapter on Formal Manuscript Writings is necessarily suggestive, not exhaustive, and drawn from descriptive rather than original sources.  I have examined in detail catalogues of the Sloane, Stowe, Harleian, and Lansdowne MSS., and I have similarly examined several catalogue volumes of the Additional MSS.  For a description of MSS. in private collections I have used the <title>Reports of the Historical Manuscripts Commission</title>.  Frequently information of MSS. is included with that of printed matter in the regular catalogues.  There are, of course, many other manuscript sources that are not available to me.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_13023" n="ix"/><p xml:id="hughey_13024">For the study of familiar letters and diaries I have availed myself of the sources just mentioned, but I have been compelled to confine myself to descriptions about the MSS.  I have had access to some three hundred rotographs of manuscript letters preserved among the various collections in the British Museum.  In addition, there are several editions of published letters and diaries.  Since emphasis has usually been placed on the study of noblewomen, I have chosen for the two individual studies a woman of the gentry class and the wife of a Reformation bishop.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13025">From the factual data I have endeavored to point out what seem to be the significant influences and trends in the cultural history of women in England between 1524 and 1640.</p></div><pb xml:id="hughey_13026" n="[x]"/><div xml:id="hughey_04" type="table_of_contents"><head>TABLE OF CONTENTS</head><table><row><cell/><cell rend="right">page</cell></row><row><cell>Book I - Formal Writings</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Chapter I - Printed Matter</cell><cell rend="right">1</cell></row><row><cell>Illustrative Charts</cell><cell rend="right">after page 96</cell></row><row><cell>Chapter II - Formal Manuscript Writings</cell><cell rend="right">97</cell></row><row><cell>Book II - Familiar Letters and Diaries</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Chapter I - Letters and Diaries in Survey</cell><cell rend="right">118</cell></row><row><cell>Chapter II - Mistress Anne Hooper.

Introductory</head><p xml:id="hughey_13029">For the student of literature and of cultural history the matter written and published by women in England during the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries affords concrete evidence of intellectual development and of significant influences.  The very number of the books, few at first, increasing steadily after the middle of the sixteenth century; the type of material presented; the trends of political, educational, and religious thought influencing the subject matter of the books; the classes of women who were writing, not always in the same proportion -- these are salient factors in an evaluation of cultural interest and achievement.  Furthermore, the published books indicate not only the ability to write and the desire to deal with ideas, but also initiative, confidence, and curiosity sufficiently keen to stimulate experiment in a comparatively new field, that opened up by the invention of the printing press.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13032">Although the inclusive dates of the present survey are 1524 and
1640, for the particular investigation of printed works by women it is
profitable as a preliminary <pb xml:id="hughey_13030" n="2"/>study to attempt to discover
just how much publishing was done by women between 1476, the time of
the first setting up of a printing press in England, and 1524.  For
that purpose then, 1486 becomes the significant date, since in that
year there appeared from the press at St. Albans the first book,
apparently, written by an English woman.  Since there are no records
until the establishment of the Stationers Company in 1554, the
difficulty in following the history of English bibliography,
sufficiently devious and labyrinthine after the Stationers devised
their Registers, is such before that time that discretion will
scarcely permit a superlative statement about any one publication.
Therefore, one is forced to hedge and say with caution the The Bokys

women before 1524.  Between 1524 and 1640 there seem to have been
eighty-five printed pieces, written by fifty-one women.<ref target="#hughey101p9n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey101p9n1" n="1" place="foot">I have arbitrarily omitted perfunctory royal compositions in the
form of printed speeches, public prayers, and state letters.  Two of
Elizabeth's addresses, several state letters, and at least three
public prayers were published contemporaneously.</note> Since only two
of the eighty-five pieces appeared between 1524 and 1545, the emphasis
for the survey of printed matter falls on the near-century from 1545 to 1640.  Estimates of amounts published and of the significance of types, therefore, will have almost equal time limits in the two centuries; and for that reason some of the results are all the more interesting.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13048">Of the eighty-five compositions fifty-eight were printed as
separate books; the others appeared in anthologies, liturgies,
primers, and other collections.  Because of the manifest influence of
religion and because of the number of translations among the
publications, the most convenient classification for purposes of more
particular consideration is (1) translations, (2) original
non-religious pieces, (3) original religious pieces.  There are
nineteen printed translations, thirty original non-religious printed
pieces, and thirty-six religious printed pieces.  Since sixteen of the
translations are of religious works, the total number of religious
productions is fifty-two, <pb xml:id="hughey_13047" n="10"/>more than one half of all books by English women printed before 1640.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13049">Twenty-four of the thirty-six religious works belong to the
sixteenth century, and the twenty-four were written by nine women, six
of whom were of the nobility.  The twelve religious publications after
1600, however, were written by twelve different women, most of them
from the gentry class.  Moreover, these twelve books were separately
printed; whereas but fourteen of the twenty-four belonging to the sixteenth century appeared as separate books.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13050">Similarly the thirteen non-religious compositions belonging to the period after 1600 were all separately printed and were written by twelve women, eight of whom belonged to the middle and gentry classes.  Although seventeen of the thirty non-religious writings were printed in the sixteenth century, they were written by twelve women, only two being without noble rank.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13051">Even more striking is the computation in an examination of the translations.  Sixteen translations were printed before 1600, and one of the three falling beyond that date appeared in 1605.  The sixteen translations, however, ten of which appeared separately, were made by eleven women, only three being from the middle class.  Two of the three translations printed between 1600 and 1640 were the work of noblewomen.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_13052" n="11"/><p xml:id="hughey_13053">Thus, there is a definite tendency for the literary efforts of women in the sixteenth century to be carried on by the royal and noble few; whereas in the part of the seventeenth century falling within this survey, the women of the gentry class and of the middle class expressed themselves in print with increasing frequency.  It would be a mistake to consider this circumstance a sudden development; during the latter part of the sixteenth century women from the middle class began to avail themselves of the advantages of the printing press.  Their literary achievements were, of course, guided by their educational advantages.  The erudition of the noblewomen is especially noticeable in the translations, undertaken less frequently than original writings by women from the gentry and middle classes.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13054">Final conclusions cannot be made, however, without examination of
the particular writers and publications making these groups just
described.</p></div><div xml:id="hughey_1020" n="2" type="section"><head>2. 1524-1600</head><p xml:id="hughey_13056">Two years after Lady Margaret Beaufort's translation of The Mirroure of Golde had appeared, Wynkyn de Worde again printed a translation by an English woman:

Parr to the Princess Mary, commending her translation of the

press, has great significance in a study of the printed works of women
in the sixteenth century.  The queen desired to know whether "sub tuo
nominee in lucem felicissime exire, an potius incerte auctore." And she
continued further: <q>Cui operae mea sane opinione injuriam facere
videberis, si tui nominis autoritate etiam posteris transferendo tantos
labores summo Reip. bono suscepiati; pluresque (ut satis notum est)

of the Princess Mary's translation is significant in itself, but that
she should further urge the use of Mary's name, seeing no reason to
reject deserved praise, is indicative of an attitude looking forward
to greater freedom than women had formerly known in the expression of
their intellectual interests.  Mary's translation was accordingly
included in the first volume from the paraphrase of Erasmus, printed
in 1548,<ref target="#hughey102p16n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p16n2" n="2" place="foot">Ballard, op. cit., p. 127.</note>  with a preface by Udall,
addressed to the Queen Dowager Katherine.  Since it describes the
cultural activities and attainments of women in England in the
mid-sixteenth century, Udall's preface is worth of some consideration.
He would have the queen note 
<q>the great number of noble women at that
time in England not only given to the study of humane sciences and
strange tongues but also so thoroughly expert in Holy Scriptures that
they were able to compare with the best writers, as well in enditeing
and penning of godly and fruitful treatises to the instruction and
edifying of realms in the knowledge of God, as also in translating
good books out of Latin or Greek into English, for the use and
commodity of such as are rude and ignorant of the said tongues.  It
was now (he added) no news in England to see young damsels in noble
houses and in the courts of princes, instead of cards and <pb xml:id="hughey_13067" n="17"/>other
instruments of idle trifling, to have continually in their hands
either Psalms, homilies or other devout meditations, or else Paul's
epistles, or some book of holy scripture matters; and as familiarly
both to read or reason thereof in Greek, Latin, French or Italian as in
English.  It was now no news at all to see Queens and ladies of most
high estate and progeny, instead of courtly dalliance, to embrace
virtuous exercises of reading and writing, and with most earnest study
both early and late to apply themselves to the acquiring of knowledge,
as well in all other liberal artes and disciplines as also most
especially of God and His holy word.</q><ref target="#hughey102p17n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p17n1" n="1" place="foot">Ballard, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, p. 127.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_13069">Certainly the few printed books by the women of this period serve to
substantiate this description of learned piety among ladies at court.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13070">Katherine Parr did not belie her own counsel to the Princess Mary.  As
her "servant" Udall wrote, <q>When she was Queen, she employed herself
days and nights in psalms and contemplative meditations in lieu of vain
courtly pastimes and gaming.  And these she herself set forth in
print, for the example of all noble women, and to the ghostly
consolation and edifying of all that read them.</q><ref target="#hughey102p17n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p17n2" n="2" place="foot">Strype, <hi rend="italic">Ec. Mem.</hi>,

print, for the example of all noble women," Udall emphasized her
advice to Mary.  Katherine Parr's chief concern in publication,
however, was for the presentation of religious doctrine, interpreted
according to Reformed tenets.  Her first setting forth in print was in

that Elizabeth's early translations, made during the period of
Katherine Parr's supervision, were from religious works; her later
translations were, in large part, secular and remained in manuscript
until more recent times.  Certainly it is significant that Mary was
prevailed upon to begin a translation from the humanistic Reformer
Erasmus, despite the fact that her health, as the account has it,
would not permit its completion and that she later caused its
suppression.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13089">Furthermore, Katherine Parr unquestionable had a decided
influence upon Lady Jane Gray, who "entered the <pb xml:id="hughey_13088" n="23"/>queen's services at

serious writings of Lady Jane, pregnant with principles of the
Reformation, testify to the success of the queen's training.  The
writing of these pieces, however, belongs to a later decade, and their
printing to a still later one.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13091">In the years immediately following the
time of Queen Katherine Parr a number of books appeared from the
press, written by women ardent in their devotion to the Reformation.
It would, of course, be manifestly illogical and exaggerated to
attribute to the influence of Katherine Parr all of these evidences of
the concern of women for the progress of the Reformation and of their
increased willingness to submit books for publication.  The
Reformation, guided by many continental refugees and by English
prelates just returned from the continent, was well under way in the
reign of Edward VI.  <pb xml:id="hughey_13090" n="24"/>The atmosphere was rife with religious
discussion.  Nevertheless, as a queen consort of an earlier reign,
unquestionably sympathetic with the Reformers, presenting her own
religious experiences and opinions to print "for the example of all
noble women," and urging the like pursuit upon the Princess Mary,
Katherine Parr had established a precedent of no mean value for all
women contemporary with and immediately succeeding her.  Her writings
are significant not because they have great literary value, but
because they were the first printed writings by a women motivated by a
desire to place the principles of the "new learning" before the
public.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13092">The only other woman to have anything published before the
middle of the sixteenth century is especially interesting for our
study because she was not a member of the royal family - Anne Kyme,
commonly known by her maiden name, Askew.  <q>She was highly educated,
and much devoted to biblical study.  When she stayed at Lincoln, she
was seen daily in the cathedral reading the Bible, and engaging the
clergy in discussions on the meaning of particular texts.  According
to her own account she was superior to them all in argument and those
who wished to answer her commonly retired without a word.</q><ref target="#hughey102p24n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p24n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>D. N. B.</title>, ii, 190.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_13094">Because of her unwillingness to accept the doctrine of

Anne Askew was the first woman to have printed an account of personal
experience written in narrative form.  It is doubtful whether an
earlier one existed in manuscript.  The examinations relate by the
dialogue device her experience under severe trial.  Her replies, made
in answer to questions subtly aimed to trap, throw light on the
penetration of her thinking and upon her knowledge of the technical
points under discussion.<ref target="#hughey102p26n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p26n2" n="2" place="foot">I have examined the portions included by

appeared after her death, the printing of Anne Askew's story is not
significant as an indication of her own interest in publication, but
rather as further proof of the concern of the public for religious
matters.</p><p xml:id="hughey_13099">Between 1550 and 1560 but three books seem to have been
published by English women, and one of these was printed in France.
In 1549 the young daughters of Protector Somerset, the Ladies Anne,
Margaret, and Jane Seymour, composed a series of four hundred Latin
Distichs in honor of the recently deceased Margaret of Navarre.  <pb xml:id="hughey_13098" n="27"/>The
following year the Distichs were published in Paris with a Latin
title-page by Nicholas Denisot, former tutor to the Ladies
Seymour.<ref target="#hughey102p27n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p27n1" n="1" place="foot">Gardiner, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, p. 178.  I have not had access to the book by the
Ladies Seymour in any form, and I have accordingly drawn my account
from that given by Dorothy Gardiner, pp. 178-180.  Apparently no
copies of the original editions are extant.  No mention of them is
made in <title>S. T. C.</title></note>  The book seems to have received an enthusiastic
welcome in France; it reappeared in new fashion: <q>Le Tombeau de
Marguerite de Valois, royne de Navarre.  Faiot premièrement en
Distiques Latins par les trois Souers, Princesses en Angleterre,
Depuis traduiotz en Grec, Italien et François par plusieurs des
excellentz Poëtes de la France 1551.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130103">Accompanying the verses were
Denisot's introduction of "les vers divins de ces trios diuines et
doctes Soeurs, vierges Angloises," telling of the writers' admiration
for Margaret of Navarre because of her learning and religious faith;
Nicholas de Herberay's address to the writers, assuring them of the
laurel, "for neither Sappho nor Cassandra, Cornelia, nor Lilia Sabini
could have done more to keep alive the fame of La Reine Marguerite";
and Pierre de Ronsard's ode celebrating the fame of the ladies and in
them "the union of the beaux esprits of England and France in a war
upon Ignorance."  Dorothy Gardiner ends her description of this
literary triumph thus: <pb xml:id="hughey_130100" n="28"/><q><p xml:id="hughey_130101">If with so gallant an escort as the Pléiade,
and with gestures so magnificent, the Ladies Margaret, Anne, and Jane
Seymour made their bow to the world of letters, the youthfulness of
their productions may well be forgiven, and the reader in welcoming a
few examples of the famous Distichs for their commendable industry need
entertain no very high expectation of original thought.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130102">Distichs from

French queen, celebrating her learning and her piety, the relation to
the religious books is almost sufficient to allow inclusion with them.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130106">The other two books of the decade between 1550 and 1560 were in keeping

delighted my mind in reading it, I have right heartily to thank your
ladyship, both for your own wellthinking of me, and for the comfort
that it hath wrought me.  But, far above these private respects, I am
by greater causes enforced, not only to shew my rejoice of this your

ladyship, and advertise the readers, to think that we have not therein
given any thing to any dissembling affection towards you, as being
contented to wink at faults to please you, or to make you without
cause to please yourself; for there be sundry respects to draw us from
so doing, although we were so evil-minded, as there is no cause why we
should be so thought of.  Your own judgment in discerning flattery,
your modesty in misliking it, the laying open of our opinion to the
world, the truth of our friendship towards you, the unwillingness of
us both (in respect of our vocations) to have this public work not
truly and well translated, are good causes to persuade, that our
allowance is of sincere truth and understanding.  By which your
travail, <pb xml:id="hughey_130114" n="33"/>Madam, you have expressed an acceptable duty to the glory of
God, deserved well of this church of Christ, honourably defended the
good fame and estimation of your own native tongue, shewing it so able
to contend with a work originally written in the most praised speech;
and, besides the honour ye have done to the kind of women and to the
degree of ladies, ye have done pleasure to the author of the Latin
book, in delivering him by your clear translation from the perils of
ambiguous and doubtful constructions, and in making his good work more
publicly beneficial; whereby ye have raised up great comfort to your
friends, and have furnished your own conscience joyfully with the
fruit of your labour, in so occupying your time; which must needs
redound to the encouragement of noble youth in their good education,
and to spend their time and knowledge in godly exercise, having
delivered them by you so singular a precedent.  Which your doing, good
Madam, as God (I am sure) doth accept and will bless with increase, so
your and ours most virtuous and learned sovereign lady and mistress
shall see good cause to commend; and all noble gentlewomen shall (I
trust) hereby be allured from vain delights to doings of more perfect
glory.  And I for my part (as occasion may serve) shall exhort others
to take profit by your work, and follow your example; whose success I
beseech our heavenly Father to bless and prosper.  And now to the end
both to acknowledge my good approbation, and to spread the benefit
more largely, where your ladyship hath sent me your book written, I
have with most hearty thanks returned it to you (as you see) printed,
knowing that I have therein done the best, and in this point used a
reasonable policy; that is, to prevent such excuses as your modesty
would have made in stay of publishing it.</p></q><ref target="#hughey102p33n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p33n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>Correspondence of Matthew

conclusion that the writings of Lady Jane were being presented in the

who had suffered at the hands of the Catholic Mary; therefore her
compositions, pregnant with Reformed tenets, would be received with
enthusiastic acclaim.  No virtue, therefore, attaches to the printing
of Lady Jane's compositions as far as she herself was concerned.  It
should be borne in mind, however, that she was a girl of sixteen at
the time of her death, only a student beginning her career.  Her
printed pieces are occasional, not the fruition of conscious literary
effort; they are testimonials of her preoccupation with Reformed
theology and of her sincere piety, suggesting latent possibilities for
mature production.  It would be manifestly unfair to accredit her with
nothing but religious interests; stories of her erudition are widely
current.  It seems reasonable to conclude, however, both from her
printed pieces and from her correspondence<ref target="#hughey102p37n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p37n1" n="1" place="foot">Her letters to Henry

of scripture, and religious controversial pamphlets are convincing
evidence of the tremendous influence of religion upon written matter
even after the early days of the Reformation, when length of life was
often governed by proper direction of faith.  Opportunity for
controversy tended to increase as Puritanism developed in Elizabeth's
reign and so the Catholics continued to maintain a hold.  The Church
of England could scarcely be called established.  A sufficiently
large number of Reformation supporters, exiled under Mary, were active
well into the latter half of the sixteenth century to insure little
abatement in the fervency of their religious faith.  Depending usually
upon the place of their former exile, whether Germany or

persecution in the Low Countries and in France increased religious
unrest.  Although the women occasionally expressed opinions upon

That so prominent a woman allowed her work to come before the public with a signature is significant.  In her the influences of the late Renaissance from Italy and France found sympathetic cultivation.
As a patroness of letters, a capacity in which she is better known
than as a creative writer, she tended to encourage expression finding
stimulus in the writings of Petrarch, of Tasso, and of the
Pleiade.<ref target="#hughey102p58n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p58n1" n="1" place="foot">For a detailed discussion of Mary Sidney as

concretely, to her appreciation of French and Italian literature.
Although she was regarded as one of the most cultivated women of her
day, she was concerned less with classic learning than with that of
more recent time; and although she collaborated with her brother
Philip in metrical verson of the Psalms,<ref target="#hughey102p58n3">3</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p58n3" n="3" place="foot">Unpublished.</note> she was not preoccupied with the study of
theology nor <pb xml:id="hughey_130196" n="59"/>fervent in her devotion to a faith.  The Countess of Pembroke stands at the end of the century in striking contrast with the educated women of its early and middle years, Margaret More, Katherine Parr, Lady Jane Grey, and Lady Ann Bacon, pupils in the classic school, ardent devotees of religion, disciples of an Erasmus, a Coverdale, or a Bucer.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130198">Whether the recognition given Mary Sidney is justified may be a matter of opinion.  That her fame has come in part from the linking of her name with that of her brother Philip is undeniable, and equally undeniable is the recognition she attained from patronage of literary men.  It is doubtful whether a Mary Sidney without rank and possibilities of patronage would be especially noticed today merely because she had translated some French and Italian and had written some verses.  Margaret Tyler translated Spanish ten years earlier than Mary Sidney published her French translations but without acclaim; Anne Dowriche set about to improve "poesie" by her verses but without reward.  Nevertheless, the Countess of Pembroke is unusually significant because, more than her feminine contemporaries, she was receptive to the influences from France and Italy contributing so largely to the molding of secular English literature in the late Renaissance period.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130200">Although her name belongs rather with the sonneteers and
playwrights of the 1590's than with austere and philso-<pb xml:id="hughey_130199" n="60"/>ophic classicists, she did not submit to the vogue of
sonneteering sufficiently to compose a cycle herself.  Despite the fact that the decade between 1590 and 1600 was the popular era for sonneteers, no sonnet cycle seems to have been written by a woman.  This lack may have been caused by the convention of the cycles demanding address to a disdainful lady from a suppliant lover.  (Shakespeare's and Barnfield's sonnets, of course, do not follow the convention.)  Also despite the glories 
of the drama in this decade, there were no plays by women.<ref target="#hughey102p59n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey102p59n1" n="1" place="foot">Lady Elizabeth Cary published <title>Mariam</title> in 1613.

is reputed to have preferred domesticity rather than intellectual

opposed to Elizabeth with her industrious study and her sympathetic
appreciation of knowledge, Queen Anne was not disposed to concern
herself with matters of learning.  There was therefore, less stimulus
for arduous study among the women of the nobility than in Tudor days.
At the same time, the dissemination of education among girls from the
gentry and middle classes had advanced through schools set up in the
latter half of the sixteenth century <pb xml:id="hughey_130202" n="62"/>by religious refugees
from the continent, usually in the form of day schools for both sexes

Hackney.  Gardiner, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>,

sometimes at hand for girls during the latter half of the sixteenth
century.  Obviously, however, opportunity to girls from middle-class
families for a few years in grammar school would not suddenly cause
marked intellectual interest and productivity among them in their
later mature years.  That occasionally in the late sixteenth century
women from the middle class did write and publish has already been
noticed.  By the opening years of the seventeenth century advantages
of education for girls had been somewhat general for a length of time
sufficient to develop a semi-intellectual level among middle-class
women.  Consequently, that these women should express themselves
through the press with increasing frequency in the seventeenth century
is not surprising.  Indications of erudition such as were found among
women of the Tudor nobility, however, do not occur.  It would, of
course, be a <pb xml:id="hughey_130204" n="64"/>mistake to draw a definite line and say that the era of intellectual interest among middle-class women began at the opening of the seventeenth century, or that similar interests entirely disappeared among women of the nobility.  Such a demarcation would not be justifiable.  Without doubt, however, those were the tendencies.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130206">As might be expected, there was a marked increase in the amount of
creative writing and a decided decline in the number of translations
published.  The only translation printed between 1600 and 1630 was a
tract from the French by Lady Elizabeth Russell, dedicated in metrics
to her daughter Ann Herbert, Countess of Worcester:<ref target="#hughey103p64n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey103p64n1" n="1" place="foot">Ballard, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, pp. 198-200; <title>R. and N.

Grymeston's dedicatory epistle, written "To her Loving Sonne Bernye
Grymeston"; and the line, "The fruitfull flowing of her loftie

breake the barren soile of my fruitlesse braine."<ref target="#hughey103p68n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey103p68n1" n="1" place="foot">Since I have examined a photostatic copy of the second edition

conclusion is easily apparent after a comparison of the second edition
with the description of the 1604 edition given by Corser, <hi rend="italic">op. cit </hi>., Pt. 7, pp. 100-105.</note>  In the
epistle the author describes herself as "a dead woman among the
living," brought to "languishing consumption" by her mother's
"vndeserued wrath."  She has consequently determined to leave with her
son, in whom her "affectionate loue which diffused amongst nine
children which God did lend, is not united," this "portable <hi rend="italic">veni mecum</hi> for thy Counsellor, in which thou mayest
see the true portraiture of thy mothers minde, and finde something <pb xml:id="hughey_130216" n="69"/>either to resolue thee in thy doubts, or comfort thee in thy distresse."  She proceeds with advice for the hours of marriage and death, urging him to censure his will and examine his thoughts, "for he seldome dies well that liveth ill."  Of marriage she advises: 
<q>Marrie in thine owne ranke, and seeke especially in it thy <hi rend="italic">contentment</hi> and preferment: let her neither be so
beautifull, as that euery liking eie shal leuel at her; nor yet so

in religious devotion and theological opinion, all behind a bulwark of
quotations from Church Fathers and classic writers and a euphuistic

Whether she gleaned her many quotations, both direct and indirect, from their original sources is problematical.  Since she frequently misquotes, supposition may be readily drawn that she used intermediate sources; but this conclusion is not so certain when it is further noted that she misquotes scriptural passages and contemporary English writers as well as the Latin and Greek authors.

It is a far cry from Margaret More's translation from the <title>Pater Noster</title> of Erasmus to Mary Tattlewell's pamphlet.  And yet, probably no woman of the lower classes could have written a book, not even a pamphlet in 1524.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130297">If the type of work published in 1630 is on the whole of a quality
less exalted than that produced in <pb xml:id="hughey_130296" n="95"/>1550, the number of women who could contribute had increased in a degree defying comparison.  If there was less erudition, there was more education.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130298">Throughout the period religion is the dominant theme in the writings.  Theological treatises, meditative devotions, metrical scriptural versions, translations from divines were offered to the public with an almost monotonous regularity after 1545.  That many of these books were inspired by a very genuine piety would hardly be denied; that others were guided by "seemliness" is likely.  Modesty was not so closely jeopardized if works were directed into devout channels.  For that reason, possibly, the custom of publishing with signature was adopted to a surprising degree.  Women from all ranks used their names, and similarly women from all ranks withheld their names.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130299">The religious works do not exclude other types entirely.  The
drama, lyric and narrative poetry, pastoral romance, treatises  on
rearing children, controversial pamphlets were represented.  There was
no printed book on medicine, despite the interest of women in
medicine; there was no book on government or politics, save the early
translations from the French writer Christine Pisan; there was only
one book on heraldry -- the early <title>Boke of Saint Albans</title>
by Dame Berners.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_130300" n="96"/><p xml:id="hughey_130301">The printed works of the women of this period do not offer means
for a complete understanding of the interests; they do, however,
reveal definite controlling conventions and pursuits, and they serve
further to amplify, and even correct, impressions left by the
literature of men.  If the printed books were dictated to some extent
by the demands of society, they are all the more significant in
interpreting the interests of their writers, who in the end are a part
of that society.</p></div></div><div xml:id="hughey_1040" type="illustrative_material"><table rend="borders"><head>Printed Matter 1476-1549</head><row><cell>1476-1499</cell><cell>1500-1539</cell><cell>1540-1549</cell></row><row><cell>Dame Julia Berners<list><item><title>The Boke of

contemporaneously, but remaining in manuscript<ref target="#hughey200p97n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey200p97n1" n="1" place="foot">As I have explained in the preface, this presentation of formal

descriptive rather than original sources.  I say with some confidence,
however, that I believe the material here mentioned to be

were found in the printed works; that is, translations, religious
writings, non-religious writings.  Significantly, however, the
proportional amounts in the groups are not the same; also
significantly, almost all of the manuscript writings are by women of
the nobility; and, further, most of the compositions were written
before 1600.  Names of women whose works were published appear also as
authors of manuscript writings; but there are new names -- women who
published nothing, with literary and scholarly interests exemplified
in manuscript material only.<ref target="#hughey200p97n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey200p97n2" n="2" place="foot">A number of these writings have been published since 1640, as will be indicated.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130305">Rarely does one find more concrete evidence of the influence of the
classics in the early English Renaissance than in the manuscript
translations of the women. <pb xml:id="hughey_130304" n="98"/>Since the greater number of sixteenth-century translations by women were not published, the influence of Latin and Greek can be more clearly noted in the manuscripts than in the printed books.  Although translations of theological works continue to predominate in the manuscripts as in the published books, their ascendancy is not so pronounced.  This circumstance leads again to the supposition suggested previously that women were more likely to publish their religious writings than those of secular type.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130306">Extant manuscript translations seem to indicate a monopoly in that field by women of royal and noble rank.  Women of the nobility had greater opportunities for education, and translations are exemplary of cultivation and a certain amount of erudition, obtained only from training.  Without doubt, a number of the manuscript translations were originally designed merely as school lessons; that purpose may account to some extent for their remaining unprinted.  It is true that the published translations include some by middle-class women, but they are in a decided minority.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130308">The learned and gifted Margaret More, or Roper, translated not only

The stimulus was of no mean import among noble women at court.  Furthermore, she remained firmly attached in her studies to the Latin and Greek writers, disdaining to give serious attention to the more modern Italian and French, fast superseding the classic in popularity during the 1590's.  Elizabeth may not have had gifts for original poetic composition equal to those of her talented rival Mary Stuart, but she seems certainly to have devoted herself industriously to study.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130328">Apparently the only extant examples of Mary Stuart's translations

these themes - exercises undertaken by girls from a few families of
the nobility, where the father, or perhaps an earnest tutor, embued
with humanistic ideals, encouraged the young women in the cultivation
of liberal pursuits.  Select, indeed, were girls to whom such
opportunities came, and by no means representative even of upper-class
women.  Thus, although there is marked influence of the classics upon
the manuscript translations of sixteenth-century women, the
circumstance does not follow that women as a whole were so influenced,
or even that <pb xml:id="hughey_130329" n="107"/>they were sufficiently informed to understand the meaning of the classic revival.  The only conclusion to be drawn is simply that those women who were introduced to Latin and Greek and who were so fortunate as to be encouraged by liberal scholars apparently found pleasure in their studies and worked with some devotion upon their exercises.  Obviously the attitude of the father was of paramount importance; his initiative was usually that for the family.  Both Sir Thomas More and Sir Anthony Cooke definitely set about to educate their daughters as liberally as if they were sons and, since the daughters of Henry FitzAlan dedicated their translations to him, he must have encouraged their educational ventures.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130331">Of a different type is the manuscript translation of Petrarch's
<title>Trionfa della Morte</title> by Mary Sidney, Countess of

Pembroke in Sir John Harington's 'Nugae Antiquae.'  Also in a letter

Letters and Diaries in Survey</head><p xml:id="hughey_130361">The familiar letters and diaries of men and women are frequently
more revealing in the portrayal of the sympathetic concerns of human
nature, in the intimate affairs of daily life, in the fundamental
character and cultivation of the writer than are the formal writings.
Less studied than writings intended for a public through press or
manuscript, they are often a more accurate medium for interpreting the
common general interests of the writers and of the recipients.
Letters are, of course, sometimes perfunctory in purpose and
restricted to the requirements of a particular matter; as such they
are valuable only when considered with similar letters to observe a
current tendency or when accepted as data in the solution of a factual
problem.  Such are business and official communications.  Letters of
this type are frequently but messages of information, and, as a matter
of course, have been customary through the centuries, the form suiting
the age.  The art of familiar letter writing, however, with the
ensuing emphasis upon current happenings and the depiction of intimate
personal concerns is a comparatively recent development; the
seventeenth century, indeed is sometimes described as "the glorious
age of letter writing."  To the late sixteenth <pb xml:id="hughey_130360" n="119"/>and seventeenth centuries belong the bulk of the news letters - the famous letters of Chamberlain, of Dudley, and of the Fuggers.  To the seventeenth century also belong letters of middle and upper-class women, stimulated to self-expression by a medium more kindly and inviting than a treatise or a set of meditations.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130362">It is idle to consider here in any detail the letters of women in
the royal families, either in the sixteenth or the seventeenth
centuries.  That they wrote letters and wrote them well, the printed
editions attest.  Their letters, to be sure, reflect the conventions
prevailing during the particular quarter or decade of the century when
they happened to be written; consequently, letters from royal women
are, on the whole, less formal and more sincerely expressive of
individuality during the latter part of the period than in its
beginnings.  The group of letters from Mary Stuart to Bothwell are a
famous exception -- love letters become classics.<ref target="#hughey300p119n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey300p119n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>Mary Stuart, Bothwell, and the Casket Letters.</title>  Ed. with Introduction by J.

increasing numbers were writing letters when the sixteenth century
began and when it ended, their letters <pb xml:id="hughey_130363" n="120"/>sometimes rivaling their formal writings in import.  Of such a
character was the correspondence of Margaret More and her sisters with
Erasmus<ref target="#hughey300p120n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey300p120n1" n="1" place="foot">Ballard, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>,

Anne played at Barley Break upon the bowling
green, witnessed the performance of masques and plays at Court, sang,
played upon the viol, and at Tables and Blecko, and made cushions of
Irish stitch work.  Nevertheless, serious work was not neglected.  She
records one day, that she dressed a chamber in the afternoon, and set
up the green velvet bed on which she and her lord were to lie that
night.  Another day she spent with Marsh, "who did write the
chronicles of 1607," perhaps from his mistress's own notes.  On yet
another she signed with her own hand thirty-three letters to her
tenants in Westmoreland.</p></q><ref target="#hughey300p136n3">3</ref><note xml:id="hughey300p136n3" n="3" place="foot"><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi>, Intro., p. 55.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130441">In his funeral sermon for Lady Anne, Bishop Rainbow said:

Interest there is because the material is interesting -- but charm there is none.

<q>After I was readie I was Called away to the Church, for which Cause

It would scarcely be fair to seventeenth-century women to allow Lady Hoby to represent them, despite her minute day-by-day record.  Although women of the period were often painfully devout and serious in their religious observances, they are by no means always somber and plodding in their accounts, as their letters testify.  Perhaps, indeed, the letters offer better opportunity than the diaries for building pictures of the writers; certainly they more nearly relate the writers to family and friends.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130446">The other journal of the period is that of Grace Sherrington, Lady
Mildmay, set down when she was old and therefore more philosophic and
less concerned with details.  The story of her girlhood, of her
training, and accomplishments, of her rather dreary married life
appear under touch of a hand guided by a perspective attained through
the passage of years.  She has had time <pb xml:id="hughey_130445" n="139"/>to reflect upon
the education of her daughter Mary and upon the training of children
in general.  Her portrait painted in 1613, shows the <title>Book of
Simples</title> in her hand a fitting accompaniment, for her daughter
wrote that she "spent a great part of her days in the search and
practice 'of man's body drugs, preparations of medicines, and signs of
disease.'"<ref target="#hughey300p139n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey300p139n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>Diary of Lady Hoby</title>, Intro., p. 53.

business letters and family letters.  Her portrait, drawn from these
letters, is presented in some detail in Chapter III, a picture, it is believed, of a representative woman of the country gentry in the early seventeenth century.  Letters of the wife of a Reformation bishop, Anne Hooper, have been chosen to build a picture of a sixteenth-century woman.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130453">On no account could these two women be accepted as true for all.

Richard Hilles to Bullinger.</note> Hooper had written Bullinger of a
certain Anna, a young woman of noble birth, "exceedingly favourable to
true religion," whom he had met at the home of Master Richard Hilles,
an English religious refugee in Strasburg.  In all probability this
Anna, whom, significantly enough, Hooper hoped Bullinger would shortly
see, and who commended herself to the prayers of the church in Zurich,
was Anne De Tserclas, who is also described by Bullinger<ref target="#hughey400p143n3">3</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p143n3" n="3" place="foot">Heinrich Bullinger, <title>Diarium (Annales vitae)</title> de Jarhre 1504-1574, p. 35.

by-standers who heard the confession of Hooper <pb xml:id="hughey_130459" n="144"/>which is described in a letter from Master Hilles:
<q>If there is any news here, or from England, you will learn it by
the letter of a certain countryman of mine who is studying here, whose
name if John Hoper, formerly in the court of our king, but now a
disciple of Christ, the King of Kings, and glowing with zeal and
piety, and most attached to your name of all other divines.  He was
sick at my house, almost unto death; and when, to all appearances he
was on the point of departure, he uttered the language and profession
of a most godly christian breast respecting the matter of the
eucharist, and all the articles of the christian faith, before many
by-standers.</q><ref target="#hughey400p144n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p144n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>Zurich Letters</title>. iii, 251.

That her family cast her aside because of her religion is evident from an incident related by Hooper after their marriage:
<q>Take care, I pray you, that the other letters which I send, may be
delivered to those to whom they are directed.  After Easter my wife
wrote to her mother, who lives about fifteen miles from Antwerp.  The
messenger found her father dead.  Her mother received the letter and
gave it my wife's brother to read, who immediately threw it into the
fire without reading it.  You see the words of Christ are true, that
the brother shall persecute the brother for the sake of the word of
God.</q><ref target="#hughey400p144n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p144n2" n="2" place="foot">Dated, May 3, 1549.</note></p><pb xml:id="hughey_130462" n="145"/><p xml:id="hughey_130463">Hooper himself was suffering the displeasure of his father, a

Quoted in a footnote, <title>Zurich Letters</title>, iii, 34.</note> of whom he was the only son and heir and who was opposed to him on account of "Christ's religion."  Hooper feared that if he should refuse to act according to his father's wishes, he should be sure to find his father for the future "not a father, but a cruel tyrant."  Motivated by a desire to establish his claims to his inheritance and to secure an income suitable for his proposed marriage, he determined to return to England in the spring of 1546 "to bid farewell to the honours, pleasures, and friends of this world." 
<q>I will then endeavour, he wrote, if possible, by the assistance of my friends, to obtain at least some portion of what I am entitled to, wherewith I may be able to subsist upon my slender means among you at Zurich: and should God order it otherwise, and see fit to visit me with poverty and want, or in any other way, I will bear it with an undisturbed mind, and choose rather, as an exile, to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130464">His arrangements with his father seem to have been satisfactory; but his journey was long and hazardous, keeping him three months away, bringing him twice into imprisonment, and causing loss of his fortune.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_130465" n="146"/><p xml:id="hughey_130467">It had been through the kindness of his father that he had first
been trained for service in the Catholic Church, when he had, as he
later described his monastic life, "begun to blaspheme God by impious
worship and all manner of idolatry, following the evil ways of my
forefathers, before I rightly understood what God was."  After the
dissolution of the monasteries he associated himself with the gay
circle of Henry VIII's court.  There chance brought to his attention
the writings of Huldrich Zwinglius and Henry Bullinger, which he began
at once to peruse "night and day, with earnest study, and an almost
superstitious diligence."  Intent upon furthering the doctrines of the
Reformers, he returned to Oxford;<ref target="#hughey400p146n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p146n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>D. N. B.</title>,

divine and to remain fixed in his own ideas, he forfeited his safety
in England.  He fled to Paris; then, after a short time, ventured to
return.   Finding England still hazardous, he "was compelled, under

drowning, through France to the higher parts of Germany."<ref target="#hughey400p147n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p147n1" n="1" place="foot">John Foxe, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, vi, 638.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130468">This was the man, then, whom Anne De Tserclas met in Strasburg.  Whether she had already left Antwerp and had taken refuge in the house of Master Hilles before Hooper's arrival in Strasburg cannot be ascertained.  She may have come after his entry into the University as a student of theology.  There is no indication that she had at any time been a member of a cloister, although many of the women who were most ardent in their support of the Reformed religion were, like the men whom they frequently married, monastic in earlier training.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130472">At Strasburg marriage among the clergy was no innovation in 1546.

continental clerical marriages differ in that respect from the lay
marriages of the period, which were ordinarily either arranged or were
dependent solely upon the romantic element, evincing little concern
for congenial mental tastes and interests. Thus there often appeared
in the clerical marriages something at least of the element of
friendship, though this was, of course, not always the case.

prevailing toward the wives of clergy was different from that which

the wives and children of the ministers was degrading, so much so in
fact that it was advisable in 1552 to pass another bill for the
purpose of further exonerating clerical marriages and of insuring
legality to the children of these marriages.  According to this later

It would be a mistake, however, to assume that she entered into these discussions as an equal or that she accounted her own opinion as of value, especially when her husband was present to offer counsel.  She came to these conversations doubtless as the early Christian women turned to the elders of the Church, to whom Lady Jane Grey compared her own relations to Bullinger.

Whether Anne Hooper was in part responsible for her husband's advanced ideas about divorce is impossible to say; but it is not unlikely that indirectly because of his high regard for her integrity she influenced his liberal views with respect to the rights of women.  Shortly after his arrival in London Hooper was engaged in controversy concerning rights of divorce on grounds of adultery and subsequent rights of remarriage.  Since he allowed the husband and wife equal redress, the conservatives, permitting the privilege to the husband only, bitterly attacked him.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130513">Between à Lasco and John and Anne Hooper there could be no
argument about the doctrine of the eucharist, for they followed the
doctrine of Zwinglius and Bullinger.  It was with Martin Bucer that
they disputed on that point.  In 1548 Hooper had written Bucer, who
had brought about the Wittenberg Concord in 1536 in an attempt to
effect a compromise between Luther and Zwinglius,<ref target="#hughey400p167n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p167n1" n="1" place="foot">The concession to Luther was made at the

<q>Thus the holy supper is a testimony of grace, and a mystery of our redemption, in which God bears witness to the benefits bestowed upon us by Christ: not that the remission of sins, which in believers ought to precede all use of sacraments is there applied; nor that the true body of Christ, which is in heaven and not on earth, is exhibited together with the bread; but that it may confirm that faith which I have in the death and passion of that body which was alive, died, and rose again: and the minister gives what is in his power, namely, the bread and wine, and not the body of Christ; nor is it exhibited by the minister and eaten by the communicant otherwise than in the word preached, read, or meditated upon... It is necessary therefore to bring Christ to the sacraments by faith, and not to look for him there.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130514">Because Edward VI was favorably impressed by Hooper's opinions on the eucharist, he asked Hooper to preach the Wednesday Lenten sermons at court during the spring of 1550.  This is significant inasmuch as Hooper represented the most advanced views of Reformed religion; it likewise indicates the tendency toward the doctrines from Zurich as opposed to those from Wittenberg.  According to Hooper, one of the articles demanded by the Archbishop of Canterbury from his preachers was a subscription to the eucharist as taught at Zurich.  Hooper further writes:
<q>With the exception of the church of Zurich, and those which agree with it in religion, the word is in no part of the world preached more purely than in England.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130516">This situation came about through the influence of Somerset, who

following the Lenten sermons in 1550, he was offered the bishopric of
Gloucester.  He refused the see because he objected to the oath of
supremacy and to the wearing of the vestments.  The oath was removed
by order of the king; but Cranmer refused to omit the vestments.
There was great dispute, much passing of opinions among the divines;

The signature to her first letter is, rather curiously, "Anne De Tserclas, now Hooper"; thereafter the signature is simply "Anne Hooper."</p><p xml:id="hughey_130526">In her letters there is usually some reference to current affairs.
In this earliest one she refers to the preparation of a fleet of the
French king for the purpose of taking Ireland, and of the discovery of
his designs by a Frenchman in the employ of the English.  She likewise
mentions danger of riots from shortage of provision.  After her
removal to Germany she relates <pb xml:id="hughey_130525" n="172"/>to Bullinger n a letter of 1554 news both about England and Germany:
<q>There is no news much worth your notice.  For there has not been of a long time any certain intelligence from England; except that those persons who arrived from thence on the 10th instant, assert that a meeting of parliament had taken lace respecting the coronation of the Spaniard; and that the hand of an individual had been burnt off, because he refused to hear mass, and chose rather to be brought to the stake; also that some godly persons had lately been thrown into prison for the sake of religion... The lesser assembly of the states of Germany commenced here on the fourteenth of October; but this has no concern with religion, about which they have not yet said a single word.  They are labouring for the tranquility of Germany, that it may be safe from the attacks of the marquis of Brandenburgh.  I cannot say what is proposed respecting the French (king), for I have not heard.  I wish the people of Germany would not so rashly trust in foreign princes who are of a different religion from themselves.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130528">The point of view in this account, obviously religious, is by no means unintelligent and evinces a definite interest and opinion.  Since her husband was not with her at the time of writing, these results are all the more significant.  In her letters to Bullinger she at no time takes up theoretical discussions, as does her husband in his letters to the foreign divines.  Nor are her letters as highly polished in diction or as indicative of a background of reading as are those of Lady Jane Grey to Bullinger.  Thus, for example, writes Lady Jane:
<q>For you are not only, as St. James says, a diligent herald and
preacher of the gospel, and of the holy commands of God, but also a
true observer and doer of them; and you manifest in your own life the
practice that your precepts enjoin, not deceiving yourself.  Neither,
in-<pb xml:id="hughey_130527" n="173"/>deed, do you resemble those who behold their natural
face in a glass, and, as soon as they have gone away, forget the form
of it; but you preach true and sound doctrine,and by your manner of
life afford an example and pattern for others to follow what you both
enjoin and practise... Were I indeed to extol you as truth requires, I
should need either the oratorical powers of Demosthenes, or the
eloquence of Cicero.</q><ref target="#hughey400p173n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p173n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>Zurich Letters</title>, iii, 9.  See also the quotation from another letter of Lady Jane to Bullinger, pp. 21-22, this paper.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130532">Less pretentious, Anne Hooper's letters are more intimate, concerned with the affairs of everyday life, expressive of warm friendship.  To Bullinger and his wife she stands somewhat in the relation of a daughter.  
<q><p xml:id="hughey_130529">If your son should happen to come to England, I shall have a better opportunity both of writing, and also in some measure of repaying your paternal affection for us, and which I value more than the richest treasures of gold or silver.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130530">I recognised, my venerable friend, in the letter you lately wrote me, your wonted kindness; you shew yourself so anxious about me, that I could not expect more even if you were my father.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130531">I pray you, my father, to salute your wife, my mother affectionately in my name.</p></q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130534">She beseeches Bullinger to recommend to "master Hooper to be more
moderate in his labour: for he preaches four, or at least three times
every day."  She considers it her duty to give an account of her
daughter Rachel, <pb xml:id="hughey_130533" n="174"/>the more so, no doubt, since Bullinger was the child's godfather.  At the time of Anne Hooper's first letter Rachel could have been no more than three years old.  We are therefore compelled to consider from this account that she was something of a prodigy and also that she had careful instruction.
<q>First, then, you must know that she is well acquainted with English, and that she has learned by heart within these three months the form of giving thanks, the ten commandments, the Lord's prayer, the apostle's creed, together with the first and second psalms of David.  And now, as she knows almost all her letters, she is instructed in the catechism.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130535">As early as December of 1549 John Hooper had written that his daughter was endued with a most happy memory and that of all languages she best understood the Latin.  Again in February, 1550, he wrote that she was making progress both in body and mind and that she understood the "English, German, French, and Latin languages very tolerably, and especially the Latin."  That John Hooper, perhaps more than his wife, was building hopes upon the future religious activity of his daughter in the same way as if she had been a son is an interesting fact.
<q>You must know however that I have had no addition to my family since the time I quitted your godly society.  If the Lord will preserve my little daughter Rachel, so that she may embrace his Son Jesus Christ, and promote his cause, I shall think my desires abundantly accomplished even if I should have no more family.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130536">The little girl seems to have received diligent attention from both her father and her mother and to have become at an early age a painfully serious adherent of religion, though perhaps their accounts should not be read too literally.  It was upon the mother that the burden of instruction fell, as might be expected, since Hooper was preaching several times a day and was often from home.
<q>She [Rachel] very frequently hears from her mother the great commendation of the country and place where she was born; and she is with great care and diligence instructed in the promises which she formally made to the church by means of your kindness and that of the wife of master Bibliander.  She sorely complains of my not more frequently saluting by letter so holy a church and such faithful ministers of Christ.  She now sends an entire piece of cloth as a token of her reverence and respect, one half to yourself, the other to the wife of master Bibliander; and she heartily thanks her heavenly Father, that by you as her sponsors she has been received into the society of his holy church.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130537">Surely one would be justified in saying that the little Rachel was without doubt in a religious home, the daughter of earnest parents, where the glorification of the Reformed church was the chief end in life.  Their son Daniel was not born until some time later, evidently only a short time before Anne Hooper left England.  Nothing is said of his training, but it was very likely similar to that accorded Rachel.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_130538" n="176"/><p xml:id="hughey_130539">Perhaps their zeal became less intense just after Hooper became Bishop of Gloucester; or perhaps Martin Micronius was not justified in his criticism of them to Bullinger.  He urged their counsellor to recommend meekness and gentleness to Hooper and to exhort Mistress Anna not "to entangle herself with the cares of this life."  He proceeds further:
<q>Let her beware of the thorns, by which the word of God is choked.
It is a most dangerous thing for one who is in the service of Christ
to hunt after riches and honours.</q><ref target="#hughey400p176n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p176n1" n="1" place="foot"><title>Zurich Letters</title>. iii, 576.  Dated, Aug. 14, 1551.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130541">Hooper himself had at one time passed criticism on Bernardine

But of what offence Anne Hooper was guilty, it is impossible to say.
She mentions in her letter to Bullinger dated from Gloucester in 1551
that she has had no leisure to write because she has been "overwhelmed
by so many and urgent engagements."  It is necessary to remember also
that the Reformed leaders, especially those of the Zurich group, were
very strict in their standards of godliness, and therefore the
criticism of Micronius cannot be considered too seriously.  Hooper
spoke of his wife as "a godly and wise <pb xml:id="hughey_130540" n="177"/>woman."<ref target="#hughey400p177n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p177n1" n="1" place="foot">Hooper, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>,

to the poor of the parish. Foxe continues:

common hall, I saw a table spread <pb xml:id="hughey_130542" n="178"/>with good store of
meat, and beset full of beggars and poor folk: and I, asking his
servants what this meant, they told me that every day their lord and
master's manner was to have customably to dinner a certain number of
poor folk of the said city by course, who were served by four at a
mess, with hot and wholesome meats; and when they were served (being
before examined, by him or his deputies, of the Lord's prayer, the
articles of their faith, and ten commandments), then he himself sat
down to dinner, and not before.</q><ref target="#hughey400p178n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p178n1" n="1" place="foot">Foxe, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, vi, 644.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130545">Foxe relates the circumstance as Bishop Hooper's story; but we may

having exhausted his frail resistance, died in 1553, and his elder
sister Mary came to the throne.  Mary was Catholic; John and Anne
Hooper belonged to the most advanced section of the Reformed church.
Therein lay a tragedy.  For Anne Hooper and for many other women in
England peace ceased <pb xml:id="hughey_130546" n="180"/>to exist with the crowning of the new sovereign, a Queen.  The queen was after all but the earnest and zealous representative of a group who were as sincerely religious as were those who held the tenets of Reformed religion.  Each was equally unyielding, perhaps equally narrow.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130548">Whatever regard may have accrued to the wives of the clergy after
the passage of the bill of 1552 was forthwith removed.  Parliament

upon the throne and had declared himself in favor of Mary, he was
nevertheless one of the first of the bishops to be summoned for
examination.  He was ordered to London to answer Dr. Heath, who had
been deprived of the bishopric of Warcester under Edward <pb xml:id="hughey_130549" n="181"/>VI, and Dr. Bonner, Bishop of London.  Before he could meet
them, he was taken before the Council at Richmond, August 29, 1553,
where his old enemy Gardiner, Bishop of Winchester -- deprived under
Edward VI by Ponet - met him with many taunts about his religion.
Since the laws of persecution were not yet revived, it was necessary
to condemn him on some charge other than that of religion; he was
therefore sent to the Fleet on account of debt to the queen.<ref target="#hughey400p181n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p181n1" n="1" place="foot">Foxe, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, vi, 645.

Hooper, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, <title>Biographical Notice</title>., p. xxii.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130556">On October 13, 1553, while he was in the Fleet, he wrote his wife
the letter bearing this caption:  "An exhortation to patience, sent to
his godly wife Anne Hooper: whereby all the true members of Christ may
take comfort and courage to suffer trouble and affliction for the
profession of his holy gospel."<ref target="#hughey400p181n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p181n2" n="2" place="foot">Hooper, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, pp. 578-588.</note> The letter, which is
about three thousand words in length, is similar to many others
written during Mary's reign by ministers to members of their churches
to exhort them to courage under their trials.  Especially were the
women recipients of these letters, modeled after the epistles of
St. Paul. Hooper's letter begins:  "Our Saviour Jesus Christ, dearly
<pb xml:id="hughey_130551" n="182"/>beloved and my godly wife, in St. Matthew's gospel said to his disciples, that it was necessary slanders should come."  He reminds her that in times past men born of the Flesh persecuted him born of the Spirit.  Corrupt minds are incapable of perceiving the truth and persecute in the name of God.  Since such dangers must come, Christians must bear them in patience as Christ commanded.  There should be no sedition, for Christ will protect Christians: the very hairs of their heads are numbered.  To people of God trials can be but  a gain and an advantage, but it is not the nature of man to bear troubles either of body or mind until he has been regenerated by the Spirit.  Man cannot endure his losses in this life unless he learns, as St. Paul commands, to think upon the certainty of heavenly joys in the life to come.  "But these things, my godly wife," Hooper continues, "require rather cogitation, meditation, and prayer, than words or talk."  He suggests definite scripture for her perusal, urging her again to remember that it is a reward to suffer for Christ.
<q><p xml:id="hughey_130553">Is it then any marvel, if such Christians as God delighteth in be
so mangled and defaced in this world, which is the kitchen and mill to
boil and grind the flesh of God's people in, till they achieve their
perfection in the world to come?  And as man looketh for the nutriment
of his meat when it is full digested, and not before; so must he look
for his salvation when he hath passed this troublous world, and not
before.  Raw flesh is not meat wholesome for man: and unmortified men
and women be no creatures meet for God.  Therefore <pb xml:id="hughey_130552" n="183"/>Christ saith that his people must be broken and all-to torn in the mill of this world, and so shall they be most fine meal unto the heavenly Father.  And it shall be a christian man's part, and the duty of a mind replenished with the Spirit of God, to mark the order of God in all his things, how he dealeth with them, and how they suffer, and be content to let God do his will upon them; as St. Paul saith, they "weep until the number of the elects be fulfilled, and never be at rest," but look for the time when God's people shall appear in glory</p><p xml:id="hughey_130554">We must therefore patiently suffer, and willingly attend upon God's doings, although they seem clean contrary, after our judgment, to our wealth and salvation... When Christ would make the blind man to see, he put clay upon his eyes, which, after the judgment of man, was means rather to make him double blind than to give him his sight; but he obeyed, and knew that God could work his desire, what means soever he used contrary to man's reasons: and as touching this world, he useth all his after the same sort...</p><p xml:id="hughey_130555">But, my dearly beloved wife, you know how to perceive and to beware of the vanity and crafts of the devil well enough in Christ.  And that he may the better have patience in the Spirit of God, read again the 24th chapter of St. Matthew, and mark what difference is between the destruction of Jerusalem, and the destruction of the whole world; and you shall see that then there were left alive many offenders to repent: but at the latter day there shall be absolute judgment and sentence, never to be revoked, of eternal life and eternal death upon all men; and yet towards the end of the world we have nothing so much extremity as they had then, but even as we be able to bear.  So doth the merciful Father lay upon us now imprisonment (and, I suppose, for my part shortly death), now spoil of goods, loss of friends, and the greatest loss of all, the knowledge of God's word.  God's will be done!  I wish in Christ Jesu, our only Mediator and Saviour your constancy and consolation, that you may live for ever and ever; wherof in Christ I doubt not; to whom for his blessed and most painful pass on I commit you.  Amen.  Your brother in Christ.</p></q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130557">Thus did an imprisoned Reformation bishop in the sixteenth century address his wife.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130559">The letter has great significance.  It indicates the relation which
existed between John Hooper and his wife, <pb xml:id="hughey_130558" n="184"/>and it definitely suggests the mental equipment and the religious training and experience with which Anne Hooper was able to meet her husband's Biblical exhortations.  If he had not been accustomed to discussing matters of religion with her, after his imprisonment he would hardly have written so at length and with so much certainty of being understood.  He states specifically that she knows well enough "how to perceive and to beware"; he refers to her scriptural reading; he adopts the attitude of one who presupposes full comprehension.  At the same time, the tenor of the letter throughout is that of one written by an instructor to an intelligent pupil.  That attitude is to be expected when we recall the generally accepted opinions of the relation of the husband to the wife as comparable to that of Christ to the Church.  The letter by its painful seriousness, by its all-pervading concern with matters of religion, by its formal expression of regard and its lack of intimate tenderness reveals poignantly the stark intensity of the lives of these two people, consumed with a passion for religion, almost to the exclusion of all else.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130561">John Knox wrote many letters giving spiritual counsel to his wife

thousand, according to Burnet, fled in the company of the French
Protestants, although certificates from the French ambassador were
required for this privilege.  Anne Hooper very probably left England
with French friends, for she wrote Bullinger that she was conducted
safe to Antwerp and from there accompanied a suitable party to
Frankfort, where she joined a "female relative."   This relative, it
happens was the wife of Valerandus Pollanus, the minister of the
former Church of the Strangers in Somerset, England.<ref target="#hughey400p190n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p190n1" n="1" place="foot">See page 161.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130573">Frankfort was a popular resort for both the English and the French exiles.  Anne Hooper wrote Bullinger on April 20, 1554, that the senate had granted liberty to the foreign church for their whole ecclesiastical ministry both of the "word and the sacraments."  Master Pollanus was chief pastor of the Church of the White Virgins, which was opened by him on April 19, 1554.  In September of that year Mistress Hooper sent Bullinger a book "from which you may know the constitution and general order of our little church: in which should there be any thing which you think requires correction, you will exceedingly oblige him by letting him [Pollanus] know; and I entreat you to do so for Christ's sake."</p><pb xml:id="hughey_130574" n="191"/><p xml:id="hughey_130575">She was thus not a member of that group of English

the French church.  This congregation subscribed to the French
confession of faith but were allowed the English order of service with
some omissions in responses and in liturgy.  Anne Hooper makes no
reference to the quarrel ensuing between this congregation and that of
the exiles in Strasburg, who offered to join their fellow believers in
Frankfort; but she could scarcely have lived in Frankfort as a member
of the French church and not have been aware of the flanks of
Knoxians, representing Frankfort, and of the Coxians, representing
Strasburg, who were waxing tempestuous by the spring of 1555.  It is
perhaps odd that she expresses no opinion, since Bullinger with Calvin
and Martyr was to be consulted should further dispute arise after the
settlement agreed upon early in 1555.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_130576" n="192"/><p xml:id="hughey_130577">Anne Hooper had at this time troubles far more poignant than those of church disputes.  Her husband had remained in England.

Anne Hooper was at the same time writing to Bullinger not to deny her husband the comfort of letters and also reminding her friend of her own "need of the prayers and sweet consolations" of her friends to aid her in bearing her burden of widowhood. 
<q>I earnestly entreat you therefore, not to cease pleading for me
with the Lord in your prayers, and by a letter from time to time to
arouse my spirit, which, to say the truth, I very often feel to be all
but dead through grief.  And I now require the aid of all godly
persons, although I am never entirely forsaken of the Lord, who
sometimes refreshes me with the anticipation of a better life.  But
you yourself know how suitable to a diseased mind is the conversation
of a sincere friend.  I trust in the Lord, that the letter which you
are writing to my dear husband, will afford him no less consolation
than the one to myself; and in his name <pb xml:id="hughey_130582" n="195"/>I thank you for that service.  He is indeed worthy of the kind attention of all godly persons.</q></p><p xml:id="hughey_130584">Sometime in the spring of 1555 Anne Hooper had to learn of her
husband's martyrdom: he was burned at the stake in Gloucester on the
ninth of February, 1555.<ref target="#hughey400p195n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p195n1" n="1" place="foot">See page 192.</note>  To Bullinger she turned again for special consolation and guidance:
<q>I am dead here till God shall again unite me to him.  I thank you
for your most godly letter.  I certainly stand much in need of such
consolations, and of your prayers.  I pray you therefore by the holy
friendship of the most holy martyr my husband, of whom being now
deprived I consider this life to be death, do not forsake me.  I am
not one who is able to return your kindness; but you will do an
acceptable service to God, who especially commends widows to your
protection.</q><ref target="#hughey400p195n2">2</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p195n2" n="2" place="foot">The original Latin of this letter is printed in <title>Zurich Letters</title>, iii, 774.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130586">She requested Bullinger to publish a book of her husband's, the
manuscript of which he had sent her before his death.  She had first
asked the favor of Peter Martyr, who was then in Strasburg, but Martyr
refused because of Hooper's doctrine of the eucharist, not then
accepted in Stras-<pb xml:id="hughey_130585" n="196"/>burg.  She had permission of the senate
at Frankfort to have the book printed there, but she preferred that
Bullinger should revise it and have it printed in Zurich under his
direction.  She gives no indication of the title of the book; and,
since Hooper wrote some twenty-four pieces during his
imprisonment,<ref target="#hughey400p196n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p196n1" n="1" place="foot">Strype, <title>Ec. Mem.</title>, III, i, 282.</note> it is difficult to identify the particular manuscript in question.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130588">Whether the farewell of this letter of April 11, 1555, closed the
correspondence between Anne Hooper and her old friend Bullinger cannot
be determined.  At least there is no later letter available; but there
would surely have been other letters about the publication of the
book.  More exactly, however, a postscript and not the formal farewell
from a "loving gossip and sister in Christ" closed this last letter to
Bullinger.  The postscript is curiously interesting and even a little
gratifying; for though it reflects the bitterness of her recent
experience and the habit of interpreting Biblically, it also
indicates that she who was so entirely trained in patience was not
without some spark of human indignation.  This is the postscript:
<pb xml:id="hughey_130587" n="197"/><q>Your god-daughter Rachel send you an English coin, on which are the
effigies of Ahab and Jezebel.</q><ref target="#hughey400p197n1">1</ref><note xml:id="hughey400p197n1" n="1" place="foot">The English money of this period bore the effigies of Philip and Mary.</note></p><p xml:id="hughey_130589">With the word <hi rend="italic">Jezebel</hi>, the last we have from her, Anne Hooper condemns the queen who, as religious and as earnest as Anne herself, had brought suffering and exile to Anne Hooper and death to John Hooper.  With that significant word Anne Hooper's story ends.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130591">The story is not so colorful as is that of Anne Askew.  There is no
bold and daring martyrdom to relate, no adroit fencing with examiners,
no formal written testimonial of religious experiences.  And yet Anne
Hooper left her home for the sake of religion; she came to England,
aware of her husband's prophecy of death for himself and experiencing
opprobrium for her marriage.  Her story is not an impressive in
erudition as is that of Lady Jane Grey; and yet she wrote letters in
Latin to one of the most renowned men of her time.  She knew also
Hebrew, French, and English, and she regretted that she did not know
German.  She wrote intelligently of current affairs, and she met the
teachings of her husband with understanding.  She was a careful and
intelligent teacher of her children, holding Reformed religion <pb xml:id="hughey_130590" n="198"/>as the motivating force.  Because of that force one looks in vain for lightness and humor in her story, but one finds only accounts of patience and earnest godliness.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130592">Through all she deferred to masculine guidance.  She accepted the
inferiority of her sex as a Christian tenet set down by St. Paul and
therefore to be followed.  So she was taught by all the Reformed
leaders.  Her husband and his associates were preceptors to whom she
could listen.  Despite her belief in her native inferiority she never
questioned that she must show equal strength and patience in the
religious life: she had been redeemed by Christ as had her husband.
The force which molded this attitude was a potent one and significant
not for one century but for many.</p></div><pb xml:id="hughey_130593" n="[199]"/><div xml:id="hughey_500" n="3" type="chapter"><head>III<lb/>

VIII, second son of Edmund Knyvett of Buckenham Castle in Norfolk,
married Jean or Jane Bourchier, daughter of John, Baron Berners.
Jane's only sister dying without issue, the estate of Lord Berners
came to her.  Jane Bourchier Knyvett survived her husband by many
years and likewise her eldest son, John, upon whom she made a
settlement at his marriage with Agnes Harcourt.  The bulk of her
estate passed on her death in 1561 to Thomas Knyvett, son of her
eldest son, John.  The part of the estate held by John's wife, Agnes,
came to Thomas at her death in 1579.  Blomefield, <hi rend="italic">op. cit.</hi>, v, 153-4.  Sir Thomas Knyvett petitioned
the Crown to grant him the barony of Berners, but he died in 1616

great-granddaughter of Sir Thomas, was confirmed in the barony.

She was wise in the understanding of the human heart, sensitive to the desires of others, appreciative of kindness and affection, positive in her opinions but gentle in her bearings, capable of quaint flashes of humor, unafraid of the demands of hard work and of seasons of illness, perceptive of the value of learning, though she was herself no scholar, religious with enviable sincerity.  In her letters there lives on the story of human life that is always fundamentally the same, a story, though enhanced and brightened by local allusions, both of time and place, yet, still modern in its basic significance. </p></div></div><pb xml:id="hughey_130747" n="[256]"/><div xml:id="hughey_600" type="conclusions"><head>Conclusions</head><p xml:id="hughey_130748">Women in sixteenth-century England were disciples of the Reformation rather than of the Renaissance.  The strongest force, indeed, affecting the lives and interests of all classes of both Tudor and Stuart women, if we may believe their writings, was religion.  Although the particular impetus might be Catholic, Reformed, or later, Puritan doctrine, fundamentally the stimulus was the same.  Because of the general sway of Reformed tenets in England, and, also, because of the censorship of the press, more women appear to have given themselves to the advancement of that faith, emphasizing lack of attainment in this world and happiness in the next -- a doctrine by no means confined to women but intensified by them.  Paradoxically, religion served both to liberate and to repress.  By teaching necessity of deference to the opinions of men and by laying stress upon general feminine weakness, the religious tenets contributed certainly toward the development of selfconscious humility among the women.  With so authoritative an assurance of mediocrity it is to be wondered that women gained confidence to write, much less to publish.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130749">At the same time, however, religious devotions were accepted media through which women could express themselves without inviting criticism for "unseemly" conduct.  Katherine Parr "set forth into print" her prayers and psalms for "the example" of all women; consequently the first avowed encouragement to women to write and to publish came for the purpose of putting scriptural teaching before the people.  The precedent thus established doubtless served as a barrier against future secular publications by women.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130750">The religious emphasis directed also much of the reading, nowhere
evinced more clearly than in the large number of theological
translations from divines.  Latin and Greek most commonly quoted and
most frequently chosen for translation was that of an early Church
Father or of a contemporary prelate. Scripture was better known than
any classic.  They did, however, read Plato, Euripedes, Seneca,
Cicero, Tully, and many others of the classic writers -- if they were
introduced to them. Only occasionally did a middle-class woman seem to
have acquaintance with the classics; she was more likely to know
French, Italian, or Spanish.</p><pb xml:id="hughey_130751" n="258"/><p xml:id="hughey_130752">The most significant trend from the middle of the sixteenth century to the middle of the seventeenth century is that of the leveling of cultural interest among women.  The sixteenth century contributed an ideal for the development of a highly educated woman; the seventeenth century compromised with the ideal -- lowering it and broadening it.  As education became more general, it became less elevated.  Ideals for feminine development emanating from humanistic scholars were modified by practical instruction by continental refugees and later by assuaging influences of a Stuart court.  Middle-class women in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries were expressing themselves in formal writings of a type showing moderate cultivation.  Results of a fairly general education and of a broadening in interest are best revealed, however, by the familiar letters, evidences in themselves of a basic education in rudiments.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130754">Writings of the women reflect little concern for the gayer sides of
the Renaissance, the frivolous side of feminine character customarily
portrayed by the men in their writings, for gaiety lends itself better
than sobriety to the story seeking a public.  The women for <pb xml:id="hughey_130753" n="259"/>whom Lyly wrote <title>Euphues</title> were apparently not the women who were writing either in formal literary style or in letters.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130755">If we should attempt to understand all phases of the lives of Tudor and Stuart women, we should need to examine not only their own writings, but writings about them and for them.  Nevertheless, their own writings would still remain the basic source for information, more nearly furnishing, as Elizabeth Grymeston wrote, "the true portraiture" of their minds.</p></div></body><back xml:id="hughey_130927"><div xml:id="hughey_700" type="bibliography"><head>SELECTED BIBLIOGRAPHY OF FIRST IMPORTANCE

RUTH W. HUGHEY<lb/>
1899-1980</head><byline>Joni Laney and Mary Ruth Laney Reilly<lb/>
Great-Nieces of Ruth Hughey</byline><p xml:id="hughey_130920">Born in 1899 in rural Arkansas, Ruth Hughey was the eldest daughter of a Methodist minister and his wife, both college graduates. When she was two years old she was stricken with polio, leaving her severely crippled and requiring braces on both legs and crutches to walk. In 1920, Hughey graduated from Galloway College, located in Searcy, Arkansas and, encouraged by her English advisor, sought to pursue graduate studies at Columbia University. Though the university would not formally accept her, she traveled to New York anyway and began taking courses to prove that she could do the work. After a trial semester, she was admitted to full standing, no matter that she was a woman and Southern, from a college no one had heard of, laboring under the ravages of polio. Hughey graduated the following year with a masters degree in English, but by now she had run out of money.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130921">Determined to obtain her Ph.D., she returned South where over the next several years she earned enough money by teaching to resume her graduate studies, this time at Cornell. She received her Ph.D. in 1932 with her thesis entitled "Cultural Interests of Women in England from 1524 to 1640 Indicated in the Writings of the Women." Upon graduation she received an American Association of University Women Fellowship for research in England, the first of several trips she would make. In 1935 she was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship that enabled her to continue her work in Britain. Through the personal courtesy of the Duchess of Norfolk, she had use of the private library in Arundel Castle where she discovered the Harrington Manuscript of Tudor Poetry. The New York Times called Hughey’s archival discovery "the most important find in English letters this century." She returned to the United States just as war broke out in Europe.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130922">After teaching a year at Mount Holyoke College, Hughey was invited to join the English Department at Ohio State University. At that time she was the first woman faculty member in the Humanities. Her office was on the third floor of a building without an elevator. She climbed the stairs several times a day managing books and crutches without assistance. She quickly won the respect of faculty and students with her courage, her rigorous scholarship and fine teaching.  Some years later she became the first full professor in the Humanities at Ohio State. She retired in 1974.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130923">Ruth Hughey may have been known in the scholarly world as Dr. Hughey, but her nieces and nephews knew her as Aunt Ruth. Early on we noted her fierce rejection of any pity and her determination to do things on her own, even when, as she grew older, her gnarled arthritic fingers could no longer hold a pen and her once-strong shoulders could hardly manage her crutches. She was a demon in Canasta, ruthless in Scrabble, intent on teaching us how to be good losers yet not to give up. She was also tender, listening to our young musings as if we were brilliant, offering comments and insights as she would her own students. While in later years she mellowed, she never lost her zest for and delight in English literature. She never lost her conviction that women could overcome any obstacle and that they could and would prevail in the academy and in society.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130924">When we were young, Aunt Ruth often visited our house, then full of children and activity. Her presence had a calming influence; she would be an anchor in a room of swirling movement. In a time when women in the household were constantly busy preparing or cleaning, she gave the girls in the family tacit permission to sit for a while and enjoy the pleasure of a quiet conversation. Aunt Ruth spoke with measured deliberation, which matched her careful physical movements. This demeanor gave her a natural authority that captured the attention of her family and her graduate students. She was elegant and precise in her manner and appearance, and inspired excellence in those around her.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130925">As a child, she had excelled at handwork. The family now treasures examples of her intricate tatting and embroidery she did at an early age, an interesting parallel to the sixteenth and seventeenth century women whose writings she studied, many of whom also did handwork. Aunt Ruth recognized the value of work well done, whether it was more conventional women’s work or the writings that women have produced throughout history with little recognition. She knew that good work itself had an innate nobility that would withstand the test of time.</p><p xml:id="hughey_130926">She died at the age of eighty, leaving a legacy of research on previously unknown women writers. Her determination to herald their literary talent, which for centuries had gone unnoticed, mirrored her own struggle to survive and prevail in a culture unfriendly to brilliant, scholarly women. Like those women before her, she was heroic in refusing to let the outside world define her limits and her identity.</p></div></back></text></TEI>
