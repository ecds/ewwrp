ELIZABETHS<lb/>
SPEECH<lb/>
TO HER LAST<lb/>
PARLIAMENT.</head><p xml:id="elizabeth_1303">The 30 of November 1601, her Maiestie being set ronder State in the
Councell Chamber at Whitehall, the Speaker, accompanied with Privy
Councellours, besides Knights and Burgesses of the lower House to the
number of eight-scoore, presenting themselves at her Maiesties feet, for
that so graciously and speedily shee had heard and yielded to her Subjects
desires, and proclaimed the same in their bearing as followeth.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_1304">Mr. Speaker,</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_1306">Wee perceive your comming is to present thankes unto Us, Know I accept them
with no lesse joy then your loves can have desire to offer such a Present,
and doe more esteeme it them any Treasure or Riches, for those Wee know how
to prize, but Loyaltie, Love, and Thankes, I account them invaluable; and
though God hath raysed Mee high, yet this I account the glorie of my
Crowne, that I have reigned with your Loves. This makes that I doe not so
much rejoyce that God hath made Mee to bee a Queene
<pb xml:id="elizabeth_1305" n="A2"/>
 as to bee a Queene over so thankefull a People, and to bee the meane under
God to conserne you in safety, and preserve you from danger, yea to bee the
Instrument to deliver you from dishonour, from shame, and from infamie; to
keepe you from out of servitude, and from slaverie under our Enemies, and
cruell tyranny, and vilde oppression intended against us: for the better
withstanding wherof, Wee take very acceptably your intended helpes, and
chiefely in that it manifesteth your loves and largenesse of heart to your
Soverigne. Of My selfe I must say this, I never was any greedy scraping
grasper, nor a strict fast-holding Prince, nor yet a waster, My heart was
never set upon any worldly goods, but onely for my Subjects good. What you
doe bestow on Me, I will not hoard up, but receive it to bestow on you
againe; yea Mine owne Properties I account yours to bee expended for your
good, and your eyes shall see the bestowing of it for your wellfare.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_1307">Mr. Speaker, I would wish you and the rest to stand up, for I feare I shall
yet trouble you with longer speech.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_1308">Mr. Speaker, you give me thankes, but I am more to thanke you, and I charge
you, thanke them of the Lower-House from Me, for had I not received
knowledge from you, I might a fallen into the lapse of an Error, onely for
want of true information.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_1309">Since I was Queene yet did I never put My Pen to any Grant but upon pretext
and semblance made Me, that it was for the good and availe of my subjects
generally, though a private profit to some of my ancient Servants who have
deserved well: But that my Grants shall bee made Grievances to my People,
and Oppressions, to bee privileged under colour of Our Pattents, Our
Princely Dignitie shall not suffer it.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13011">When I heard it, I could give no rest unto my thoughts untill I had
reformed it, &amp; those Varlets, lewd persons, abusers of my bountie, shall
know I wil not suffer it. And Mr. Speaker, tell the House from mee, I take
it exceeding gratefull, that the knowledge of these things are come unto
mee from them. And though amongst them the principall Members are such as
are not touched in private, and therefore need not speake from any feeling
of the griefe, yet We have heard that other Gentlemen also of the House,
who stand as free, have spoken as freely in it; which gives Us to know that
no respects or intrests have moved them other then the mindes they beare to
suffer no diminution of our Honour, and our Subjects love unto Us. The
zeale of which affection tending to ease my People, &amp; knit their hearts
unto us, I embrace with a Princely care farre above all earthly Treasures.
I esteeme my Peoples love, more then which I desire not to merit: And god
that gave me here to sit, and placed mee over you, knowes that I never
respected 
<pb xml:id="elizabeth_13010" n="A3"/>
my selfe, but as your good was conserved in mee; yet what dangers, what
practises, and what perills I have passed, some, if not all of you know:
but none of these things doe moove mee, or ever made mee feare, but it is
God that hath delivered me.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13012">And in my governing this Land, I have ever set the last Judgement day
before mine eyes, and so to rule, as I shall be judged and answer before a
higher Judge, to whose judgement Seat I doe appeale in that never thought
was cherished in my heart that tended not to my Peoples good.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13013">And if my Princely bountie have beene abused, and my Grants turned to the
hurt of my People contrary to my will and meaning, or if any in Authoritie
under mee have neglected, or converted what I have committed unto them, I
hope God will not lay their culps to my charge.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13014">To be a King, and weare a Crown, is a thing more glorious to them that see
it, then it is pleasant to them that beare it: for my selfe, I never was so
much inticed with the glorious name of a King, or the royall authoritie of
a Queene, as delighted that God hath made me His Instrument to maintaine
His Truth and Glorie, and to defend this Kingdome from dishounour, dammage,
tyrannie, and oppression. But should I ascribe any of these things unto my
selfe, or my sexly weaknesse, I were not worthy to line, and of all most
unworthy of the mercies I have received at Gods hands but to God onely and
wholly all is given and ascribed.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13015">The cares and trouble of a Crowne I cannot more fitly resemble then to the
Drugges of a learned Physitian, perfumed with some Aromaticall Savour, or
to bitter Pils guilded over, by which they are made more exceptable or
lesse offensive, which indeed are bitter and unpleasant to take; and for my
owne part, were it not for Conscience sake to discharge the dutie that God
hath layd upon me, and to maintaine his glorie, and keepe you in safetie,
in mine owne disposition I should be willing to resigne the place I hold to
any other, and glad to be freed of the Glory with the Labors, for it is not
my desire to live nor to reign longer then my life and reigne shall bee for
your good. And though you have had and may have many mightier and wiser
Princes fitting in this Seat, yet you never had nor shall have any that
will love you better.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13016">Thus Mr. Speaker, I commend mee to your loyall Loves, and yours to my best
care and your further Councels, &amp; I pray you Mr. Controullor, &amp; Mr.
Secretary, and you of my Councell, that before these Gentlemen depart into
their Countreys you bring them all to kisse my Hand.</p><p xml:id="elizabeth_13017">FINIS.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
