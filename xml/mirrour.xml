The English translation of <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> runs to eight volumes strewn over many years and several translators and publishers.  Margaret Tyler's part, initially titled <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour of Princely Deeds and Knighthood</hi> and republished as <hi rend="italic">The First Part of the Mirrour of Princely Deedes and Knighthood</hi>, translates only the first part of the first book of the Spanish original.  The Spanish <hi rend="italic">Espejo de príncipes y cavalleros</hi> (often called <hi rend="italic">El Cavallero</hi> or <hi rend="italic">El Caballero del Febo</hi> after its main character or <hi rend="italic">Espejo de principes y caballeros</hi>) was written by Diego Ortúñez de Calahorra (the series was continued by Pedro de la Sierra and Marcos Martínez).  The inclusion of only the first volume need not deter scholars, teachers, or students.  Spanish Golden Age readers "apparently did not share the modern tendency to look at books such as these primarily as members of their respective 'families'; it was difficult, if not impossible, for a reader of the time to assemble most of the books of any 'family,' for which reason these books were more often read and discussed as individual works" (Daniel Eisenberg <hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 39).</p></div><div id="mirrourintroduction02" type="Section 2"><head>Margaret Tyler</head><p>Twelve years ago, Kathryn Coad summed up what was known about Margaret Tyler in two pages and what had been written about her work in twelve bibliographic entries.

Several collections of primary sources, especially those focusing on women's writing, have included "To the Reader" and many books on early modern English women's writing analyze it.<ref target="mirrourintro02" n="2">2</ref><note id="mirrourintro02" n="2" place="end">See <hi rend="italic">Female &amp; Male Voices in Early Modern England: An Anthology of Renaissance Writing</hi> edited by Betty Travitsky and Anne Lake Prescott (2000) and <hi rend="italic">The English Renaissance: An Anthology of Sources and Documents</hi> edited by Kate Aughterson (1998) as examples.</note></p><p>Little is known about the translator, whose sex would even be unknown—she is listed only as "M.T." on the title page—save for her signed dedication.  That dedication to "Lord Thomas Haward" [Howard] mentions her previously being a servant to this family and Moira Ferguson suggests that she may have been Margaret Tyrrell, a relative to the Howards (51).  Ferguson argues that Tyler's knowledge of Spanish and her service in the house of Thomas Howard, Fourth Duke of Norfolk, suggest that she is Catholic, but Louise Schleiner provides compelling arguments on both sides of the question.<ref target="mirrourintro03" n="3">3</ref><note id="mirrourintro03" n="3" place="end">Note: Moira Ferguson's error in identifying the family Tyler served for as that of the Third Duke of Norfolk (51) has been repeated by others (e.g. Tina Krontiris (153n18)), but all agree that she served for the Duke who was executed in 1572.</note>  Spanish "was a useful commercial language for families in international trade" and the families of "diplomats' servants and followers who had lived abroad might have "picked up a language conversationally" or may have been learned intentionally to read smuggled Catholic texts (Schleiner 4).  Although Tyler's service would have been to Howard's Protestant second wife, the mother of the Thomas Howard of the dedication, the house was friendly to Catholics (as the Fourth Duke of Norfolk's first, third, and intended fourth were) (Schleiner 2).<ref target="mirrourintro04" n="4">4</ref><note id="mirrourintro04" n="4" place="end">Schleiner's article "Margaret Tyler, Translator and Waiting Woman" also collects an array of evidence of possible relation to Tyler; those wanting additional possible biographical details of her life will find it interesting.</note>  Tyler provides one other biographical detail--references to her "aged years" ("To the Reader" [iv-v]).</p><p>Tyler's choice to dedicate the work to a young man follows Spanish tradition and links her work to a significant piece of early modern history (Eisenberg <hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 93-94 n8).  The Howard family had long been one of the most powerful in England.  Blamed for encouraging Henry VIII into his failed marriage with Catherine Howard, the third Duke of Norfolk (also a Thomas Howard) was imprisoned on charges of treason, while his son, Henry Howard, Earl of Surrey, was beheaded for the same.  The fourth Duke of Norfolk, the father of the Thomas Howard that Tyler dedicates her book to, was also beheaded, for his involvement in the Ridolfi Plot to put Mary Queen of Scots on the throne in 1572.  It seems likely that the "Lord Thomas Haward" of Tyler's dedication is the fourth Duke of Norfolk's son by his marriage to Margaret Audley, as he is the next Thomas in direct descent of the Howard line, later to become the first Earl of Suffolk.<ref target="mirrourintro05" n="5">5</ref><note id="mirrourintro05" n="5" place="end">See the "Norfolk" entry in <hi rend="italic">The Complete Peerage</hi> vol. IX, especially pages 610-26.</note>  Born in 1561, Thomas fits Tyler's claim that both his parents are dead (the Duke of Norfolk in 1572 and Audley in 1563) and he is the right age to be a "noble youth" (though already a widower by the book's publication). Tyler's dedication links her work, framed as a lesson in virtue, to a family in a questionable position.  Yet Tyler praises the Howard line:</p><p><q>In the meane time this my trauaile I cōmend vnto your Lordshippe, beseechhing the same, so to accept thereoff, as a simple testimony of that good will which I bere to your parēts while they liued thē being their seruāt, &amp; now do owe vnto their ofspring after their decease, for their demerits. Vnder your honours protectiō I shal lesse fere the assalt of the enuious, &amp; of your honours good acceptaciō I haue some hope in the mildenes of your Lordships nature, not doubting but that as your Lordshippe hath giuen no smal signification in this your noble youth of wisedome and courage to so many as knowe you, it being the only support of your auncestours lyne: so the same lykewise will maynteine your auncestours glorye &amp; the hope of your owne vertues with affabilitie &amp; gentlenesse, which was the proper commēdation of your parents.</q></p><p>The only hint of scandal is the suggestion, made unclear by the syntax, that "their decease" was somehow related to "their demerits" ("parents" is the only plural noun in the sentence, so is grammatically the referent).  Tyler's choice of dedication is conventional the Howards are a high-ranking connection but it is also a surprising choice, given the family's recent fall from favor.  It is paradoxical for a woman, for whom the act of publishing already created the potential for scandal, to increase rather than diminish her risk by her choice of dedicatee.  Rather than claiming a patron's protection, Tyler may have brought more disrepute to her work.  This unusual choice may signal her desperation.  An older woman who turned to translation and needed to renew ties with the family she was formerly employed by suggests that she was not currently in service to another, less ill-favored family to whom she could have dedicated the work.</p></div><div id="mirrourintroduction03" type="Section 3"><head><hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>'s Context</head><p>Tyler's work has received some critical attention as the first extant chivalric romance in English.  This anachronistic label may obscure, however, its connections to already developed genres that an early modern English reader might have associated it with.  In the years surrounding <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>'s publication, its printer Thomas East also produced editions of the verse history of Sir Bevis (1585) and of Sir Thomas Malory's <hi rend="italic">Morte d'Arthur</hi> (1582).  Although these editions post-date <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>, these stories were in popular circulation well before it.  This is quite at odds with the Spanish perception of <hi rend="italic">libros de caballerias</hi>: "Golden Age readers had a clear and consistent concept of which works were, and which were not, romances of chivalry," excising them from similar but distinct histories or translations of chivalric stories (Eisenberg <hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 4-7).  <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>'s mix of fictional and "historical" elements fits Eisenberg's definition—"A romance of chivalry is a long prose narration which deals with the deeds of a '<hi rend="italic">caballero aventurero o andante</hi>'—that is, a fictitious biography"—but so do many of the King Arthur narratives (7<hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> italics added).  Tyler's work, however, because it is limited to the first part of the first book of the original, bears little resemblance to early modern English biography.  While the later volumes would come to be known by the character's name, the Knight of the Sun, this volume deals equally with the Knight of the Sun (Donzel del Febo), his brother Rosicleer, and their parents.  In its English context, <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> has a closer relationship to the "histories" of Arthur and Sir Bevis that East published alongside than to modern conceptions of biography.  Early modern readers might have grouped <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> with other historical-biographical works like Plutarch's <hi rend="italic">Lives</hi> or Foxe's <hi rend="italic">Book of Martyrs</hi>.  These all presume that reading about virtuous and moral lives inspired such behavior in the reader.<ref target="mirrourintro06" n="6">6</ref><note id="mirrourintro06" n="6" place="end">Eisenberg notes a similar connection between Spanish romances and chivalric histories and states that "The current distinction made between these ‘historical' works and the ‘fictional' romances of chivalry, all of which declared themselves to be purely historical works, was certainly seen vaguely by most contemporary readers, some of whom probably did not see it at all" (<hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 39-40).</note>  Generic references in <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> are to this kind of "history" in Tyler's prefatory material used to refer to the narrative and in the narrative used to refer to the fictional source text.  Though all of these genres were developing, of all the early modern genres, history seems to have the closest connections to <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>.</p><p>Although the genre of chivalric romance was not yet cohesive, Tyler's involvement with <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> defied conventions.  Tyler's choice to print a secular prose work is unusual both of its form and its content.  Early modern English culture discouraged women writing; women who did write most often choose options that were considered appropriate shorter works in manuscript and usually religious texts.<ref target="mirrourintro07" n="7">7</ref><note id="mirrourintro07" n="7" place="end">Tyler's "To the Reader" acknowledges that her choices are unusual and could be considered improper.</note>  Tyler did follow convention in translating a text, rather than authoring a new work.  But in hindsight, it is especially unusual for a woman to have translated this work.  Spanish materials were rare in England (Tina Krontiris 20) because of the ongoing tensions between Spain and England and most romance translations would come from intermediary French editions (Coad xi).  The association of reading Spanish with closet Catholicism also adds an element of risk.  As with her dedication, Tyler presents a veneer of propriety with atypical, even potentially subversive, elements.  Tyler was not only the first English woman to publish a romance, she is the only English woman to do so until Mary Wroth's <hi rend="italic">Urania</hi> (a pastoral rather than chivalric romance, first published in 1621) (Helen Hackett 57-62).  The cultural norms surrounding similar works seem to have guided other women away from the field.</p><p>Tyler may have played a role in the conception of this genre's authorship as properly male, as her "Epistle to the Readers" presents an argument for why her work should be considered proper.  She presumes that it would be seen as untoward, presumes that because of its content and because it is a long, secular prose narrative, it would be considered a properly male domain.  As Tyler confirms, women "may honestly employ her trauaile" in "penning matters of great weight and sadnesse in diuinitie or other studies . . . other some discoursing of matters more easy &amp; ordinary in common talke" rather than the "matter more manlike" of romance ([iv]).  But Tyler's prefatory material presents a compelling argument for the propriety of women writing, and it is this which has received most of the book's recent critical attention.<ref target="mirrourintro08" n="8">8</ref><note id="mirrourintro08" n="8" place="end">See for example works by Catherine Gallagher, Kathryn Coad, and Louise Schleiner and its inclusion in various women's writing anthologies and Brown University's Women Writers Project.</note>  Tyler begins with a conservative argument, deflecting blame by minimizing her role.  She claims she undertook the translation only on the urging of her friends and that "The inuention, dispositiō timming, &amp; what els in this story, is wholy an other mans, my part none there in but the translation" ([iv]).  Tyler's disavowal of a creative role for translation parallels the original Spanish authors of romances: "the romances of chivalry were the least 'literary' type of literature being written at that time.  There was a unanimous pretense that the words were true histories, only rescued from oblivion and modernized by a sixteenth-century contemporary" (Eisenberg <hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 43).  Yet, as Eisenberg points out, this encourages anonymous publishing (<hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 43); Tyler so prominently attaching her name to her work breaks with yet another expectation.  While the genre in Spain was perceived as having "no classical model, no pedigree or tradition, and thus very little prestige," the fact that it is a translation adds some status and propriety to the English edition and shifts any blame for inappropriate content to Ortúñez de Calahorra (<hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 9).  Tyler, while claiming the benefits of translation—that this is not <hi rend="italic">her</hi> work—also claims that this is actually a better topic for women's translation.  This work is merely an "exercise," a term reminiscent of schoolboys' lessons, "a matter of more héede then of déep inuention or exquisite learning" ([v]).  Tyler frames this lighter matter as more appropriate for the supposedly limited female abilities: "I [do not] trust mine own iudgement sufficiently, if matter of controuersy were handled" ([vi]).  The low status Tyler claims for <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> also follows the Spanish example—"there was little about the romances to attract an author who wished to win praise for his literary abilities, and the romances remained in the hands of another class of writers, not incompetent at their task, perhaps, but spiritually far from the intelligentsia of the day" (Eisenberg <hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 44).</p><p>Tyler continues her argument by addressing what women may read, claiming that any work dedicated to a woman should be proper reading for her, since a woman needed to know what her name was being associated with.  Dedicating a work to a woman, she claims, is the same as female translation or authorship; what is important is that a woman's name is associated with a text.  If men are allowed to include a woman's name as a kind of guarantee of the book's quality, so then a woman might append her name to a book for what Tyler argues is similar purpose.<ref target="mirrourintro09" n="9">9</ref><note id="mirrourintro09" n="9" place="end">Gallagher in "A History of the Precedent" follows a similar line about Tyler's argument to conclude that Tyler "considers both instances of female authorship" (314).  I am unconvinced that Tyler presents both of these <hi rend="italic">as authorship</hi>, but she certainly equates the degree of potential scandal and indicates that women bear responsibility for both books dedicated to them and books they author/translate.  Gallagher argues that both dedication and translation can be considered "authorship" as both fulfill "the authorial function as the <hi rend="italic">authorizer</hi>" (italics original, 314).</note>  Tyler presumes that a woman associating her name to a text is the vital point, regardless of her role, as it is that association which could bring scandal.  Who connects the text and name—male author and female dedicatee or female translator—is irrelevant; the risk and degree of (im)propriety is equal.  It is therefore "all one for a woman to pen a story, as for a man to addresse his story to a woman" ([vi]).</p><p>Tyler's argument is bolstered by her particularly active definition of reading, which slips easily into an argument for women writing.  She claims that women may "further wade" in texts in "search of a truth"; as Catherine Gallagher interprets, "Once in the book [… the female reader is] an active prober of its submerged contents.  She has become, like the author, a seeker of the book's truth.  Moreover, once she grasps the truth it becomes hers, and she is, therefore, entitled to "deale" in it by translation and publication" (312).  This intimate relationship between the reader and the text is related the early modern fear of the influence of texts (or their performance in the theatre) and will be addressed further in the section on the book's audience and romances' reception more generally.  As Gallagher demonstrates, Tyler argues that there is little difference between reading and writing a text (312): any text dedicated to a woman is appropriate reading material for her; part of reading is "mastering" the material, making it ones own; if one already owns the material, then why may one not write about it?  But Tyler does phrase the argument as I did—with a question.  She does not force her readers to agree with her, but rather suggests.</p><p>Tyler's language and her argument for women writers belie her disavowal of a creative role in <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>.  Her word use suggests she considers herself a co-author, rather than the less-involved role she describes.  According to Brown University's Women Writers Online version of Tyler's "To the Reader," Tyler uses "I," "my," and "selfe" more than 100 times in these four pages.  That is more often than she uses "the," "of," or "to."  This might suggest that Tyler actually felt some ownership over the material and gives herself a more prominent position than the "author" (used three times), "Spanish" or "Spaniard" (used 7 times), or the "history."  While references to women and men are nearly even, the "reader" is mentioned a mere six times, which may contradict Lieber's argument for the reader's authority mentioned above.<ref target="mirrourintro10" n="10">10</ref><note id="mirrourintro10" n="10" place="end">16 uses of "women," "woman," "womans," "lady," "ladies," "gentlewoman," and "gentlewomen," and 13 uses of "manlike," "manlinesse," "mans," "men," "gentleman," and "gentlemen."  Some of the female references are self-references in her argument about appropriate women's writing.  Deborah Uman and Belén Bistué offer an excellent analysis of moments when Tyler's translation demonstrates co-authorship in "Translation as Collaborative Authorship."</note></p></div><div id="mirrourintroduction05" type="Section 4"><head>Publishing <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> (1579 and 2008)</head><p>Even setting aside theoretical questions about translation as co-authorship, the work demonstrates an addition hand (or hands) in both its content and its format.  One simple example is in the structure of the translation—the placement and titles of the chapter divisions have been changed.  Someone—Tyler, the printer, or the typesetters—adjusted these for the English edition, presumably because these divisions were considered "better" than those of the original for this audience.  The changes are most likely made by Tyler or the printer, Thomas East.  The descriptive titles necessitate knowing the entire chapter; it seems unlikely that someone laying out the text would read ahead to create such headings.  It is difficult to say that these are certainly Tyler's, however, as someone in the printing process added other elements to the text, such as the side-notes in "To the Reader."<ref target="mirrourintro11" n="11">11</ref><note id="mirrourintro11" n="11" place="end">Though some of these notes are "anonymous" because they are merely descriptive of the content of the passage, others demonstrate that they were written by someone other than Tyler: "That a vvoman of <hi rend="italic">your</hi> yeares maye vvrite in this argument," "That <hi rend="italic">you</hi> maie not write of diuinitie," "That <hi rend="italic">you</hi> meant to make a common benefit of your paines" (italics added).  Again, the typesetters could put these in, but the direct address suggests a more personal relationship between the note-author and Tyler, so Thomas East seems the likely author.

There is no certain reason behind this.  A play that Joseph de Perott argues is based the series was produced in 1578-79; it possible that the play and the translation were initially spurred by the original Spanish volumes and certainly difficult to ascertain which might have come earlier in the same year (Herbert Murch 105).   Instead, East would seem to be picking the wrong time to reprint, as <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> had just been condemned by name as inappropriate reading for youth in Francis Meres's <hi rend="italic">Palladis Tamia: Wits Miscellany</hi> in 1598 (Coad ix, Meres 269 (left)).  The reprint seems an early confirmation of the adage, there is no such thing as bad publicity.  More concretely, however, East's reprinting coincides with the Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth books being published by various other printers.<ref target="mirrourintro16" n="16">16</ref><note id="mirrourintro16" n="16" place="end">The Sixth was published in 1598; the Seventh in 1598; the Eighth in 1599; and the Ninth in 1601 (EEBO).</note>  East at least seems to disagree with Eisenberg's claim about Spanish readers approaching the books as individual works; East seems to see his initial volumes as part of a series and likely to sell now that the final volumes had been published.</p><p>The text also suggests the working methods of East's press.  The header is alternatively spelled as "Mirrour" or "Myrrour" in batches and there are repeated confusions over the work's pagination occurring at these changes, indicating at least two hands at work in the layout.  Tyler's volume also suggests a bit of haste or lack of care, as the page numbering changes format on page 17 and is often incorrect.  This edition both provides a modern, consistent numbering (marked as the digital edition) and preserves the original page numbering (marked as the 1579 edition).   Incorrect pagination of the original edition has been retained with the correct number following in brackets; pages without numbers (the introductory material and the left-hand pages) have been given page numbers in brackets.  Left-hand pages are marked with an L; e.g. the page facing 153 would appear as [153L].

Where possible, these marks have been recorded; however, many such marks may not be rendered here because of the quality of the printing or the quality of the extant edition.  These are not loan words from French and it is important to remember that Tyler expressly claims she is translating directly from the Spanish rather than through an intermediary French version to which we might credit these accents.  Alexander J. Ellis suggests that such accents mark a diphthong sound (Section VIII, p 77).  East often used this accent, and it is not limited to works in translation, a specific set of authors, or a single era of typesetting in his printing house.<ref target="mirrourintro20" n="20">20</ref><note id="mirrourintro20" n="20" place="end">Other examples of the use of an acute accent for double e: <xref url="http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/26056"><hi rend="italic">The Foundation of Rhetorike</hi></xref> by Richard Rainolde printed by John Kingston in 1563.

This mark appears only in the Blackletter poems, not in E.K.'s Roman commentary on the text.  If the accent reflects the length or stress of the vowel, then it would affect the length or meter of the line, surprising in a work so concerned with meter.  If the accent mark reflects a change in the pronunciation, it may be that Spenser's archaic spellings were of more importance for their look than their sound.  It is interesting to note, however, that when a rhymed word has an accent mark, so does its mate, which suggests the printer was matching the pronunciations to preserve the rhyme.  Yet it is also difficult to imagine "see" and "yeeres" / "peeres" having the same pronunciation, though all three include the accent in June (stanzas 3, 5).</note></p></div><div id="mirrourintroduction04" type="Section 5"><head><hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>'s Audience</head><p>Although seventeenth-century critiques of romances suggest that the reading audience was primarily female, Tyler's Dedication and "To the Reader" present a more diverse picture.  As Helen Hackett notes, the prefatory pieces of the next volumes address a male readership and "early editions [of Iberian romances] evince no intention, feigned or otherwise, to appeal to a female audience" (68).  Certainly, Tyler does not <hi rend="italic">exclude</hi> male readers; in fact, she seems to presume they will be her audience.  <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi>'s "chiefe matter . . . is of exploits of wars, &amp; the parties therin named, are especially renowmed for their magnanimitie &amp; courage" ([iii]).  As mentioned above, this content is supposed to inspire similar virtues in those who read it; since these are traits traditionally associated with masculinity, it is not surprising that Tyler claims Ortúñez de Calahorra's intent is to "bring thée to a liking of the vertues héerein commended, and by example therof in thy princes &amp; countries quarrel to hazard thy person &amp; purchase good name" and "to set on fire the lustie courages of yoūg gentlemen, to the aduauncement of their line, by ens<unclear>u</unclear>ing such like steps" ([iii]).  Like eating, drinking, and even playgoing, reading, it seems, was expected to have an effect on the inner state of a person.  In a world slowly abandoning humeral understandings of the body (East did print a wide range of medical texts, including Galen), the qualities of one's reading could be seen as having a direct and significant impact on one's body and mind.  Tyler's defense of her work is to emphasize that it might be historical ("To the Reader" [i]) and, more importantly, regardless of its degree of truth, the effects of its examples are beneficial for the reader.<ref target="mirrourintro22" n="22">22</ref><note id="mirrourintro22" n="22" place="end">Eisenberg reports that Spanish romances "always declared, sincerely or no, a moral intent" (<hi rend="italic">Romances</hi> 13, continued discussion page 45 and following).</note>  Sir Philip Sidney in his <hi rend="italic">Defence of Posey</hi> claims a similar effect for another romance: "I haue knowen men, that euen with reading <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Gaule</hi>, (which God knoweth wanteth much of a perfect Poesie,) haue found their harts mooued to the exercise of courtesie, liberalitie, and especially courage" (qtd.

Tyler carefully avoids any discussion of the masculine traits a romance may inspire when arguing for the appropriateness of a female readership  There she focuses on a less well-defined virtue—the "truth" that can be gleaned by searching the text.  Helen Hackett points out that "Tyler's epistle is … implicitly an argument for women to be allowed to read romances as well as to emulate her in translating them," but that it is not until the final parts of the series that prefatory materials explicitly promote the works to a female readership (61).<ref target="mirrourintro24" n="24">24</ref><note id="mirrourintro24" n="24" place="end">Uman and Bistué agree that Tyler's argument for women writing begins with an argument for the appropriateness of women reading his material, which implies a (not exclusively) female audience for <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> (310).</note>  It is presumed that romances would be affective, but have different effects of each sex.  Later, male readers will be mocked for emulating romance's active morality (as in <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi>), while female readers will be criticized for their enjoyment of the idealized love stories, a pleasure not even mentioned in Tyler's prefatory material.</p><p>An interesting indication of both romance's readership and its connections to other genres comes from the diary of Lady Anne Clifford.  Tina Krontiris notes that Clifford lists "<hi rend="italic">The Faerie Queene</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Arcadia</hi>, and Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Government of the Turks</hi>, and Chaucer" alongside romances in her diary (28); all apparently appealed to the same reader.  Yet, as Schleiner points out, "waiting women read to her when she wanted to hear a romance, while male attendants read if the work was something serious, such as a treatise on Turkish government" (4n10).  Although one woman is the intended audience, the works are already, even while the genre is still developing, gendered.</p><p>As Joseph de Perott discovers, the series as a whole was widely influential; he finds references to it in Beaumont and Fletcher's works (<hi rend="italic">Philaster</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The Knight of the Burning Pestle</hi> and many more) and suggests it may be source material for Shakespeare's <hi rend="italic">The Tempest</hi> (76-8).

This little scholar also demonstrates the effects of these books; Billy begins to attack the servants during his sleep because "he thought himself to be really engaged in these imaginary Fights" (5).  This parody continues as Billy runs away for imagined adventures, even writing love poems to the neighbor's daughter Joan Grumball, whom he addresses as Dulcina (6).</p><p>The status of the book and references to a "mirror of knighthood" have a rapid decline.<ref target="mirrourintro26" n="26">26</ref><note id="mirrourintro26" n="26" place="end">It is nearly certain that these are references to <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> series, as the phrase does not appear in any full-text works in EEBO before the first volume's publication in 1578-80.  In fact, they seem to begin around the time of the reprinting of the first three volumes and the first publication of the final volumes.  Perhaps this is more than mere coincidence—the availability of the complete work may have been an "event" in public consciousness, though the purchasing of nine volumes at once from several publishers would seem to be beyond most purses.  Henry Thomas catalogs many of these references and many more to other romances, to "knight of the sun," and various character names from <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> in his <hi rend="italic">Spanish and Portuguese Romances of Chivalry: The Revival of the Romance of Chivalry in the Spanish Peninsula, and its Extension and Influence Abroad</hi>.

By mocking romances <hi rend="italic">as a genre</hi> for their negative effects, <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> opens a floodgate for similar critiques.  William Vaughan in 1626 praises <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote</hi> for its ability "to reclaime a riotous running wit from taking delight in those prodigious, idle, and time-wasting Bookes, called the Mirrour of Knighthood, the Knights of the Round Table, Palmerin de Oliua, and the like rabblement, deuised no doubt by the Deuill to confirme soules in the knowledge of euill" (11).  The works mocking <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> and its readers, using "mirror of knighthood" as purely ironic praise, or arguing against its desultory influence come flooding in.<ref target="mirrourintro29" n="29">29</ref><note id="mirrourintro29" n="29" place="end">See for example: Thomas Overbury's "A Chamber-Mayde" (1615), John Taylor's <hi rend="italic">A shilling or, The trauailes of twelue-pence</hi> (1621), John Davies's <hi rend="italic">A scourge for paper-persecutors.

Yet most of these references also appear in works intended for broad appeal; an author could apparently expect a reference to <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> to be understood by much of the work's audience.</p><p>There is also the question of how such books were to be read.  Some have argued that romances changed the reading experience to one that "protects by privacy whatever thought, response, fantasy, approval, or disapproval arises from the exposure.  As a distinctly private activity, reading inspires reconsiderations of one's boundaries: economic, social, physical, geographic, or political" (Naomi Conn Liebler 3).  This is certainly our modern conception of reading, but it is less clear if this method had developed before Tyler's publication.  As Lady Clifford's diary indicates, at least some of her "reading" was listening to someone else read aloud; the Princess Olivia in <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> also often has her waiting-woman read aloud to her even her most private letters (though she is also literate, as she writes to Rosicleer).  Reading early romances may have more in common with storytelling than with the modern reading experience, especially if, as some have suggested, some "readers" might be expected to translate as they read aloud.<ref target="mirrourintro30" n="30">30</ref><note id="mirrourintro30" n="30" place="end">This also may be a reading experience limited to the upper-echelons of society.  Lady Clifford had more than one literate person in her household to read to her; the same may not be true of a merchant's daughter with the means to buy a romance but perhaps not the means or status to hire a literate serving woman.  One is tempted to speculate that a group of lower-status women might also have a shared the reading experience as one read to a group while the others sewed.  These shifting methods of reading follow Walter Benjamin's theory of the developing novel's effect: "A man listening to a story is in the company of the storyteller; even a man reading one shares this companionship.  The reader of a novel, however, is isolated, more so than any other reader … the reader of a novel seizes upon his material more jealously than anyone else.  He is ready to make it completely his own, to devour it, as it were" (100).  This devouring is similar to the overwhelming effects of romances mocked by Cervantes and others.</note>  A further limit to reading the text may come from its use of Blackletter for the body of the story (it uses Roman font for marginal material).  Some readers may have been limited to reading either the Roman or Blackletter font (Keith Thomas 100).<ref target="mirrourintro31" n="31">31</ref><note id="mirrourintro31" n="31" place="end">Charles Mish also suggests that by 1600 printing a romance in Blackletter signaled it was for a "middle-class" reading audience.  He differentiates between the Blackletter font used for "crude and old-fashioned stor[ies] of open-mouthed wonder" and for "chivalric romances" aimed at the "middle class" and the Roman font used for "the artistically and culturally more advanced romance, exciting admiration rather than wonder" and for "sentimental or heroic romances" preferred by the "upper-class" audience (627-28).  Winstanley's work, among others, suggests that the categories were less precise—works from either side of Mish's divide often appear condemned together.</note>  Modern readers may be encouraged by this Roman rendering, especially those considering assigning the text to students.  The volume also uses a Roman font (inconsistently) for proper names; we have rendered in bold those that the original marked so as to preserve the reading experience of the original text for a modern audience.</p><p>Though initially sold on moral grounds, the text offers wide-ranging pleasures for modern and early modern readers.  The book deals at length with illicit sex and its aftermath, battles against impossible odds, world travel and its accompanying marvels and adventures, and philosophical debates and moralizing asides.  While the text itself sets up tension and uncertainty, those are often undercut by the chapter headings and always by the assurance of the genre itself, which presumes the hero will triumph over adversity, regardless of the odds.  The pleasure is in seeing <hi rend="italic">how</hi> the hero navigates the predestined situation and that wording is accurate—the hero's success is predicated on his virtue, which was determined by his noble birth and beauty and is confirmed by his faith.<ref target="mirrourintro32" n="32">32</ref><note id="mirrourintro32" n="32" place="end">The text is careful to note that the Knight of the Sun (Donzel del Febo) is favored by God ("which had created him with so wonderfull marks" (31/61)) and although raised by the "Souldan" in Babylon he will convert ("The wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> likewise carefull of the gentleman of the Sunne, &amp; of <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, read vnto them diligently what was cōuenient, saue that as he was a <name rend="roman">Pagan</name>, so hee acquainted them onely with <name rend="roman">Pagansie</name> in their religion: Which errour notwithstanding afterwarde they both renounced.")

Claridiana is also the only female character mentioned in <hi rend="italic">Espejo de príncipes y cavalleros</hi>'s summary (located after Ortúñez de Calahorra's Prologue and the table of contents) and in the title of later Spanish editions, which suggests she was perceived as a selling point for the Spanish audience.  Her role is also minimized in the English edition of the first part, an intriguing difference that Uman and Bistué unpack in "Translation as Collaborative Authorship."  <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> may also enhance work on understandings of race and ethnicity in the early modern period with several potentially "dark" characters. The "Tartarian" knight Prince Zoylo is described as "a Morian borne, &amp; somewhat of colour tawnie, yet had he a manly countenaunce, and therwithall pleasant, that he pleased them as well as his companions" (153/305).  The English edition makes much of Zoylo's heritage, often referring to him as "the Tartarian" rather than by his name (which is not true of many other foreign knights), yet the book also lavishes praise on his prowess (he defeats both Princes Bargandel and Liriamandro and is nearly Rosicleer's equal).  <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour</hi> also describes the evil Raiartes in racially loaded terms: "his face to be very foule and fearefull, of coloure more tawnie and sunburnt, then cole blacke, hys eyes flaminge in his heade, his nostrels wide and large, broade lippped, and his sharpe fanges issuing out of his mouth like boares tuskes, and reaching to his chinne, so that there was no man liuinge but might haue bene <sic>afraied</sic> of hys fierce semblaunce. But besides this, hee was so highe that there was not any in that place whom this knight excéeded not two spanfulles at the least, and in makinge of his body he was so large and well quartered, more them the compasse of two knightes" ([43L]/84).  The usurping and dreaded Africano, "the brauest and boldest knight that euer was in all the coastes of <name rend="roman">Africke</name>," is also a potential place for such analysis though he is described with non-racial characteristics (as a "Gyant" and a "Pagan") ([30L]/58). </p></div><div id="mirroursummary" type="Section 6"><head>Summary of <hi rend="italic">The Mirrour of Princely Deedes and Knighthood</hi></head><p>The Emperor Trebatio of Greece goes to war against Tiberio, the king of Hungary, to revenge Hungarian raiding in Greece.

Following the chariot, he is magically imprisoned by Lindaraza (Lyndaraza) for twenty years (though he believes it is only a few hours or days) and she bears him a son.  Meanwhile, Briana's bears twins in secret, known only to her waiting woman, the aptly named Clandestria, who fosters the boys in her sister's house.  Eventually, Clandestria works out a plan for these children to be raised in the court, near their still-undiscovered mother Briana.  The boys are remarkable for their beauty and for certain birthmarks.  Donzel del Febo (or the Knight of the Sun) is born with "a little face figured [on his side], shining as bright as if it has ben a little Sunne" and his brother Rosicleer is born with "a white Rose fashioned of so perfect making, that it séemed to be gathered, from some arbour of Roses" (21/41).</p><p>Shortly after coming to the court, Donzel del Febo is lost in a river that flows into the sea.  He is rescued by Prince Florion, the usurped ruler of Persia, who brings the Donzel del Febo to the court of Orixerges, the "Souldan of Babilon" (26[29]/57).  Florion has also rescued Prince Clauergudo of France and keeps both in the Babylonian court because of a prophecy that they will win him back his kingdom.  After many early deeds of valor, Donzel del Febo is knighted as a young man, changing his name to "The Knight of the Sun."  He defeats the attacking Africano, the man who had previously conquered Florion's kingdom and sets Florion back on his throne.  Upon returning to Babylon, he is separated from Clauergudo.</p><p>Rosicleer meanwhile grows up in Hungary, but soon develops wanderlust.  His mother, still in mourning for her lost husband and Donzel del Febo, reveals to Rosicleer his parentage in an effort to keep him nearby.  Rosicleer's desire to do great deeds sets him on "y^e quest of seking Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> his brother" in Great Britain (69/136).  On his way, Rosicleer liberates a valley from the tyrant Argion by cross-dressing as the young woman whom Argion had ordered to his bed.  Taking with him a squire Telyo, Rosicleer proceeds via a roundabout way to a tournament in Great Britain, meeting other knights and finding out through magic that his father and brother are alive.  Rosicleer wins the tournament at the court of King Oliuerio (Oliverio) and falls in love with Oliverio's daughter Oliuia (Olivia).</p><p>One of Briana's gentlewomen travels on her behalf to her supposed father-in-law's court.  She calls Rosicleer away to battle a giant and after he succeeds, he and two companions decide to travel the country as knights errant, sending tokens of their love to their ladies at Oliverio's court.  Rosicleer's token is hidden, but accepted with joy by Olivia.  She inquires of Briana's gentlewoman about Rosicleer's birth and upon hearing of his supposed low parentage, takes the counsel of her waiting woman Fidelia.  After regretting the need for status as well as virtue in a wooer, Olivia rejects him and banishes him from Great Britain.  Before receiving his banishment, Rosicleer and his companions the Princes Liriamandro and Bargandel fight and become friends with Zoylo. </p><p>But banishing Rosicleer does not cure Olivia's love for him, and to assuage her illness she asks Fidelia to steal a letter Rosicleer is sending to Briana via her waiting-woman.  From this letter, Olivia learns of Rosicleer's true parentage and sends Fidelia to seek and recall him to Oliverio's court.  Meanwhile, a knight of Spain has asked and been granted Olivia's hand in a betrothal.</p><p>After his banishment, Rosicleer is tricked into a battle with multiple giants and many knights, from which his unknown brother, the Knight of the Sun, succors him.  Shortly after rescuing his brother, The Knight of the Sun is accidentally set to sea and floats to Lindaraza's castle and battles his way inside.  Not knowing his father but recognizing an enchantment, the Knight of the Sun rescues Trebatio and accidentally kills Lindaraza in the process.  The two set out for Hungary.</p><p>Not knowing of his secret banishment, three knights who were companions of Rosicleer go to seek him.  These three—Zoylo, Liriamandro, and Bargandel—meet with Clarindiana, "the daughter to <name rend="roman">Theodoro</name> Lord of this Empyre and to the Empresse <name rend="roman">Diana</name> Quéene of the <name rend="roman">Amazones</name>" (142[151]/301).  Rosicleer, meanwhile, has left the scene of his last battle and goes to restore Princess Arguirosa to her throne in Thessaly.  After defeating the usurper Rolando, Rosicleer departs Thessaly.</p><p>The Knight of the Sun and Trebatio travel back to Hungary where they are able to rescue Clandestria and another of Briana's waiting-women from an attempted rape.  Clandestria recognizes the man she knows as Prince Edward and Briana's husband because he has not aged under the enchantment, though he has been gone for 20 years.  The company travels towards Briana, but the Knight of the Sun soon departs to stand as a champion for a woman unfairly accused of adultery so that her husband might seize her lands.  On his way to that fight, he is waylaid by a lady who asks that he defend her honor—in order to cross into Belgrade she has been asked to swear that another woman is more beautiful than she is.  The Knight of the Sun is successful in both the lighthearted and the serious battle and remains in the Hungarian court.  Trebatio has a delighted reunion with Briana where he reveals his true identity.  Their elopement to Greece ends this volume.</p></div><div id="mirrourfurtherreading" type="Section 7"><head>For Further Reading</head><p>This list catalogs some of the work on early modern readers, early modern women writers, and early modern English romances though it is suggestive rather than exhaustive.

But my deféce is by example of the best, amongst which many haue dedicated their labours, some stories, some of warre, some phisick, some lawe, some as concerning gouernment, some diuine matters, vnto diuers ladies &amp; gentlewomen. And if men may &amp; do bestow such of their trauailes vpon gentlewomen, then may we womē read such of their works as they dedicate vnto vs, and if we may read them, why not farther wade in thē to y^e serch of a truth. And then much more why not deale by translatiō in such argumēts, especially this kinde of exercise being a matter of more héede then of déep inuention or exquisite learning, &amp; they must néeds leaue this as confessed, y^t in their dedications they minde not only to borrow names of worthy personages, but y^e testimonies also for their further credit, which neither the one may demaund without ambition, nor y^e other graunt without ouerlightnes: if women be excluded from the view of such workes as appeare in their name, or if glory onely be sought in our common inscriptions, it mattereth not whether y^e parties be men or women, whether aliue or dead.

So that his court florished with princes &amp; knights, as wel subiects as straungers, which much magnified his great estate, &amp; him selfe held continuall exercise in armes with them, as being like enclined to nothing. His vertue by y^t report of such as knew him, was so rare that it was generally though none of his predecessors to haue had aduauntage ouer him, but rather he was of greater force then any one of them all. For many men were witnesses of his mightie strokes.

"Thus that force, which neither by tilt, turney, nor barriers, neither by speare nor swoord, neither by mallice of the enimy, nor pride of the mightie, might at any times be subdued, was nowe vanquished by y^e onely hearesay of a gentlewomans commendation.

Now when y^e emperour saw all these knights in presence, with some shamefastnes which y^e weight of y^e matter caused, he reueled to them wholy his gréefe, giuing thē to vnderstād withall; y^t vnles he had some help his life wer spilt. Among all y^e best which he had found, he reckned specially vpon one, which was, y^t secretly they shold auoyd the campe &amp; follow him.

depart with him in such order as he had deuised. Then y^e emperour made to cal before him y^e king of <name rend="roman">Boheme</name>, which was his vnckle, a very wise and expert man in armes, to whom he declared, "y^t he had vrgent occasion to be absent a while from his army, y^e circumstances wherof saith he, you shall further know at our returne, in y^e meane time, I commend vnto you y^e charge of y^e warre, &amp; for your greater credite with y^e people I deliuer vnto your hands the Imperiall scepter." The king meruailing at this y^t the Emperour did, without more demaunding of him whether or wherabout he would go, accepted y^e charge &amp; promised therein to employ his trauaile. Well, y^e night approching with the houre agréed vpon, y^e emperour &amp; the xii. knights, armed at all points with rich &amp; costly armour and with <name rend="roman">Hungarian</name> bases, secretly left y^e campe without being heard or knowen of their enimies, wherin they trauayled all night vntil the day appeared, then they alighted to rest their horses, and fed vpon such victuals, as thei had brought with them: after taking again their horses, they posted on their iourney till they wer in the myd way, between <name rend="roman">Buda</name> and <name rend="roman">Belgrado</name>, which way prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> of force must haue passed when he should go to y^e monasterie of y^e riuer.

Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> departing frō y^e king one night y^e most couertly y^t he might, went out of y^e citie with his owne xii. knights, &amp; foure of y^e kings: with these he tooke his way a whole night &amp; a day withall y^t hast he might, to ende the great desire he had to sée y^e beautifull princes. This way albeit short, yet it semed long vnto him, as being ignorāt of y^e sower sauce &amp; wofull wedding which was in prouiding. "O mariage, y^e slender &amp; weake foundation of worldly things, how is it not onely regarded by men but highly reuerenced: how seldome was it euer stedfast, and how many thousands hath it beguyled.

seth thē at euery step, they frame new causes, &amp; as it wer, forge vnto themselues sharp spurs to prick foreward this wofol life, wher they thinke to finde pleasure &amp; rest, there they finde for their losse trauaile, &amp; trouble for the death which they would fly frō. To escape either nipping coldes, or scalding heat, this only one remedy they haue to climbe vp vnto y^e mountains, wher yet y^e winde hath most force, &amp; y^e sun doth soonest parch: aboue all this hath not y^e vnsatiable couetousnes of man broken through y^e sturdy waues of the sea, &amp; cut out new passages on y^e moūtaines? But why do we cōplaine on Fortune, do not we bend hir armes to fight with vs, do not we maintain hir weapōs which peraduenture lighteth on our own necks. As for example if <name rend="roman">Paris</name> had not made a way through y^e déepe waues of y^e sea <name rend="roman">Agean</name> (which the gods had placed as a peaceable bound betwene <name rend="roman">Europe</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Asia</name>) &amp; if he had not sought <name rend="roman">Greece</name>, sith <name rend="roman">Asia</name> was large enough to haue found a fair wife in, &amp; (so it may be) much more honest then <name rend="roman">Helene</name> was, then the <name rend="roman">Achians</name> had not transported thēselues into <name rend="roman">Asia</name>, to destroy <name rend="roman">Troy</name>.

Whosoeyer <unclear>coms</unclear> to séeke pleasure and delight for his youth, let him take that he findes, and think it not straunge, bicause that vnkinde Fortune hath vsed the like vnto others." The prince then being on his way, two of y^e kings knights were dispatched before by some secreate by wayes very well knowne vnto them to aduertise y^e Q<unclear>u</unclear>éene and princesse of y^e approaching of y^e prince. These ii. held on their way, not aseryed by the ambush, but so soone as y^e prince w^t this knights had entered in the thicket, they wer presētly discouered by y^e Emperour who was already armed w^t his rich armor &amp; moūted vpō a strōg &amp; light horse

The Emperour taking a great speare in his hande very sharpe, and well steeled for the purpose, went alone aside out of the woode with a softe pace, to encounter with the Prince and his knights, and beeing come right before them, sayed vnto them. "Knowe you knights that this passage is forbidden you, except you leaue your shields and your names in them. For that a ladie whom I honour and serue hath commanded me to doe it, whose loue I could not other wise obteine." The Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> was by nature very stoute, and by inclination giuen to somewhat lesse modestie in his talke then behoued suche a Prince, howbeit for this and other faultes he was a very valiaunt and strong knight, such a one as neither in great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>, neither in the kingdome of <name rend="roman">Hungary</name>, was thought to haue his peere.  But as he vnderstoode the demaunde of the knight, very wroth he aunswered him. "By God knight, if the king <name rend="roman">Tiberio</name> were as certeine of the victorie against the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name>, as I hope to chastise thy follie, then the Prince of England should not neede to come from so farre a countrey to giue him helpe. Take thou quickly that part of the fielde as shall seeme good vnto thee, and with one onely choise thou shalt see howe deere and bitter thy loue hath bene vnto thee."</p><p>As the Prince hath sayd this, and had pronounced with his owne mouth, that cruell doome, not well foreseeinge his owne fall, he tooke a great speare frō one of his knights and broched his horse with the spurres to meete the Emperour. (This he did, not for that his knights woulde not haue put themselues in the aduenture before him, euery man claiming to be first, but for that no reason suffices him. For his stoutnesse &amp; his vnmeasurable pride, made him forget the force of his enimie, and yet his enimie stoode before him so great and so bigge made, that he seemed to be a gyant.) But this Princes aduerse fortune and unhappie destinies would him to be the formost, so that the mightie <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> kn<unclear>o</unclear>we it, as well by the riches of

his armour as by the talke which had passed betwéen him &amp; his knightes, and béeing very glad to sée him in the firste which he met, he sayd vnto himselfe, O that my speare were nowe greater and stronger and the head forged by <name rend="roman">Vulcan</name>, that it might not stay in y^e armour of this knight, for that according as I see him great &amp; stronge, so I feare hée will escape my handes, and then my trauaile shall be all in vaine. Thus as he sayde, they by and by did put both their speares in their restes, and giuing either horse hys bridle, they ranne together with such fury, that they made the earth to tremble, and yet the lightnesse of their horses was such, that it semed the grasse yelded not vnder their feete.  The Prince hit the Emperour in the middest of the shéelde, and pearcing farther left the head remaining in the fine and well steeled armour, whereby the staffe broken in many shiuers made a great whisteling in the ayre. But the Emperours stroke was muche more fell, for he leuelled it with such force that it entred not onely into the shéeld and strong armour of the Prince, but passed through vnto his amerous heart all bedewed with bloud a whole armes length.</p><p>Then the Prince fel dead executing the sentence which he had giuen in these wordes, that that loue shoulde bée very deere &amp; bitter. When his people sawe him stretched vpon the grounde, there might no sorowe be compared vnto theirs, and as raging madde they ranne altogether vppon the Emperour thinckinge to put in practise their deadly anger vpon his carcase. Some with speares and other with swoords strake hym on all partes with great rage and hast, so that if his armour had not bene verie good, in short space they had hewed it in peeces. But that most valiant <name rend="roman">Greke</name>, no lesse strong then any of his auncetors, bearing his fine and sharp swoord, tourned himselfe among them in such manner, that he shethed it in their bodies. The first whom he met he cleaued vnto the eyes, the seconds arme he cut of by the elbow, &amp; being sore woun-

ded he ouerthrewe the third at an other blowe, neither straied he here, but in his rage, he dealt blows and wounded many, whiche for feare accounting him rather a diuell of hell than a knight, put themselues to flight. Albeit, they might haue recouered some courage in y^t they wer many &amp; chosen knights, alwaies against one knight onely. But the reason was for that at this time the Emperours knightes shewed themselues out of the woode. So that indéede by the great manhood of their Lord they found none left on liue saue two knights of y^e king which wer knowen by their <name rend="roman">Hungarian</name> bases. Those the Emperour commaunded to be kept carefully for y^e thing before touched.</p><p> This béeing done, the knights and other footmen which the Emperour had brought with him to guid his cariage tooke all y^e dead bodies vpon their horses w^tout leauing any thing which was theirs, &amp; altogether they caried thē into y^e think of y^e wood, frō whence they before came out, ther in y^e thickest thereoff, they made a great pit, into y^e which they threw y^e prince &amp; the knights saue y^e English bases, &amp; y^e kings letters which were néedful for his purpose. They couered thē with earth in such sort, that ther was neuer memory of them. At the time that the Prince was entered, the Emperour béeing of conditions pitiful, felt so great dolor in his heart y^t the teares issued abundantly from his eyes, ruing the losse of so great a Prince slaine out of his own country in the bewtie of his age, when also yelding a great sigh which sigh séemed to haue come from y^e bottome of his heart, he sad with a troubled &amp; low voice in this wise.</p><p>"O vnhappie and vnfortunate Prince, God knoweth how sorowful and grieuous thy death is to mée, and how faine I would haue giuen remedy in some other manner to that I most deired, and although thou wast mine enemie and come in fauour of y^e kinge <name rend="roman">Tiberio</name> to take from me my land &amp; high estate, yet woulde I not haue bene so cruel an enimie vnto thée, but y^e entire loue of the princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> draue me more therto, then mine owne enmitie,

Nowe I with that by some other meanes I might haue bene <unclear>re<gap reason="illegible" extent="2 letters"/>eued</unclear>, and not to haue bought my life by thy losse. But as loue is tirannous, so meruaile not though he want pitie towards th<unclear>ee</unclear>, which could not otherwise purchase it to himselfe: Pardon me therefore, O mightie and worthy prince, &amp; iudge <unclear>if</unclear> thou wert aliue what thou wouldest doe if by my <unclear>death</unclear> thou mightest finde remedie of thy l<unclear>o</unclear>ue." The Emperours knights which heard these words, and sawe the teares trickling downe his manly cheekes, <unclear>perceived</unclear> well howe much the death of the Prince disquieted him and they sayd amongst themselues, that by good right the Emperour deserued the prayse of the most noble and worthy Prince of the worlde. But hauing made an ende, the Emperour caused to be brought before him the two knightes belonging vnto <name rend="roman">Tiberio</name>. These two were very fearefull of the death, seeing the thinges which were already done and especially when they knewe him to be the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name>, whom they helde as their mortall enimie. Nowe when they came before him, the Emperour sayd to them. If you will doe that whiche I commande you, and keep secreate that which I tell you, I will not onely pardon you the death which I haue giuen to your felowes, but also I will bring you with me vnto mine Empire, where you shall be very well contented." The knightes better satisfied then they were, bicause he promised them life, before not hoping but the death, with good will they yelded thmselues to doe all that hee would, withall, swearing into his emperiall handes their faith and ob<unclear>e</unclear>isaunce. Then sayde the Emperour, "that which I would haue you doe is this, I haue great desire to haue the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> for wife, and this maye not be done, except I goe in the name of Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name>, to ensure my selfe with hir in the monastery of the riuer, for the which it is <unclear>necesiary</unclear> that <unclear>you</unclear> two being knowen of the Queene and the Princesse, shoulde goe in my companie, and say that I am Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name>.

With this the Emperour and his knightes tooke the letters which were directed to the Queene and the princesse, and with more hope to achiue their enquest, they put on the English bases, which made them séeme English men, then taking their way towarde the monastery of the ryuer. In the way the kings knightes tolde the Emperour howe two of their felowes were gone before to gyue notice vnto the Princesse of Prince <name rend="roman">Edwards</name> comming, and that therefore it were good to goe well aduised, for they should meete them by the way. The Emperour alowed their aduice, and charged his people vntill they approched néere them not to disclose themselues, least they retiring, their secreats might be layd open. Now fortune iumped so euen with the Emperour, as that al things succeded on his side, vntill the accomplishment of his desire, which shall be recited in the Chapter following.</p></div><div id="mirrour008" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The Emperour Trebatio was receiued at the monastarie by the Archbishop of Belgrado, and there betrothed by the name of Prince Edward.

The other two seeing the English bases, thought him to bée y^e prince of England with his knights. But y^e Emperours knightes as soone as these were within their reach laide holde on their bridels, and with courteous woordes stayed them vntill the other two knightes of the kings had talked with them.  These two declared vnto the other that which had happened betwéen prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> &amp; the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name>, &amp; in y^e end made plaine the meaning of the Emperour, both praying them to kéepe it secreate, and threatening them with death if they did otherwyse. No doubt they wondred at that which chaunced, but what the Emperour would that they promised him, &amp; were nothing repentaunt of their exchaunge.</p><p>The Emperour béeing asserteined of their faith, went with them towards the monastery of the riuer, whervnto béeing come, they founde not in the monasterie but the Quéene, the Princesse and other gentlewomen béeinge seruitors to attend vpon them, and the Archbishoppe of <name rend="roman">Belgrado</name> which there taryed for to ensure them. This Archbishop receiued the Emperour at the gate, &amp; thincking him assuredly to be the Prince of England, conducted him with his knightes, where the Quéene &amp; the Princesse were in the company of beautifull and discreate Ladies, abiding his comming. When they had saluted each other, and that the Emperour had taken a full view of the princesse, he was greatly abashed to sée her beautie, for he could not be perswaded that so great comlinesse had bene in <name rend="roman">He-</name><pb n="19" ed="digital" entity="13801:9" pages="10"/><milestone n="10     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><name rend="roman">lene</name>, although déerely bought by his auncestors, hée iudged it more heauenly or angelicall, then humaine or earthly, besides she was of a goodly stature excelling the other gentlewomen in height a span. The Princesse when she sawe the Emperour before hir, shée iudged him to bee the goodliest knight that might be in the world, which his beautiful face and pleasant countenaunce shewed especially. When thus by the eies each of them were indifferently satisfied, the Emperour would haue kissed the hand of the Quéene <name rend="roman">Augusta</name>, but she with great good will embraced him. By and by, tourning himselfe againe towardes the Princesse, hée tooke hir by the hand, and sayde in effect thus much.</p><p>"The fame of your great beautie, excellent Princesse, hath in such sort passed through the world, that the onely report thereof hath forced the prince of England to leaue his naturall kingdome and soile, to come and serue you in this countrey, and to beholde with his owne eies that whiche his eares woulde scarcely beléeue. God hath made me so fortunate that I haue obteined the good will of the king your father, and of the Quéene your mother for to haue you to wife.

And with these wordes, kissing the kings letters he deliuered it into hir handes, which the Princesse receiuing with a graue &amp; sober countenaunce, and after taking it to y^e Archbishop for to read, the meane time made aunswere softly, on this wise.</p><p>"I would to God most worthy Prince, that I were such a one as with reason might deserue some part of y^e paines which you haue taken onely to sée me, or that I might in some little respsect recompence the great pleasure you haue done to me, &amp; to al this kingdome in cōming, to succour vs

with your great force and power, but sith desert doth want so much in me, I will accomlish that which the duetie of obedience vnto the king my father forceth me vnto, for y^t I must subiect my wil vnto his cōmaundement, yet I so comsider of this your offer &amp; request, as that from this time I will dare to compare with you in like happinesse.</p><p>While these wordes were in speaking, the Archbishoppe began to reade the kinges letters, wherein onely was conteined his consent wtih the desire of dispatch, that presently vpon the princesse comming they should be married. The Archbishop with both their consents taking their handes, married them with all the ceremonies and wordes which the Church ordeineth. After this the Emperour embraced the faire Princes, and with vnspeakeable gladnesse kissed hir on the white and red chéekes, and from thence brought hir into a gorgeous chamber, where they draue foorth the rest of the day with a very amorous and delectable talke, which so much the more set his loue on fire, as he procéeded farther in his pleasant daliaunce. Albeit ere night the most puissant Emperour was not altogether quieted in his thought, for feare least some one which knewe the Prince might haue bewrayed them, at length béeing certeine that none in the monastery had séene either the one or the other, but onely the kinges .iiij. knightes, and his owne men which kept that matter close ineugh, when the houre of supper approched, hee supped with some pleasure, and so helde on a greate parte of the night till it was time to take his reste. Then the Emperour was ledde to one side of the monasterie, wherein there was a riche and stately lodginge, where he lengthened the night with many fancies, not hauinge as yet reached into the very depth of his enterprise, albeit, it stilled a little with y^t which already had happened.

This inconueniencie troubled his thought &amp; increased his melancholy, as nothing more for that the terme which the king had set for his retourne was all ready expired, and beeing afraide least the kinge would send for him, whereby his fault should be discouered, without giuing remedy to that which had bene the originall of his griefe, in such wise he was tormented that he could neither sléepe nor eate. And in his imagination he did naught els but gase on the princesse, expecting time when he might alay the heate of his amorous passion. But whether it were Fortune, or the will of God, it fell so out that there was begotten betwéene them the fruite of their desire. For one morning walking in his chamber, he espied out of a windowe the Princesse alone in hir night gowne, going towards a fresh and pleasant gaudein butting vpon his lodging, (the gardein before he had not séene). Into this gardeine entered none but the Princesse and hir gentlewomen. As hée sawe so good and prosperous a time, the most ioyfull man that euer was, hee went towardes the pleasaunt gardeine, and findinge no entery but by the chamber of the Princesse, the doore, where-

Nowe when she sawe hir selfe thus sodeinly taken by the Emperour, with a fearefull starte shée rose from whence she was, and gentely smiling as somewhat ouertaken with shamefastnesse, she beshrowed him in this sort. "Assuredly my Lord, néedes must the hurt bee greate which you haue susteined by your leape, and great is the iniury which the gardeine hath receiued by your entery, bicause that in it none haue come, but either my selfe, or my gentlewomen: for whose solace it was first plotted out. For this cause God hath shewed mée such fauoure, aunswered the Emperour, bicause I haue lodged my heart in your excellent beautie, and well maye the body lawefully enter where the heart is harboured. Let not therefore my entrie, good madame, séeme straunge vnto you, sith that neither houre nor moment I may departe from you. And if this my rudenesse hath procured you any paine, by the fréedome which you haue giuen me my heart shal make excuse vnto your beautie, vnder whose safe conduct without demaund of leaue, my body hath entered." The good Emperour hauinge thus sayd, embraced &amp; kised hir, &amp; not leauing any leasure of reply, made hir to sit down by him néere vnto the well. This place was so hedged &amp; compassed about with odoriferous Roses &amp; swéet smelling Jessamines, y^t they might not be perceyued by any. And y^e gentle mourmure that the running water made vppon the pibble stones, agréeing with the delicate layes which diuerse birdes made vppon the gréene boughes, encreased so

much the longing desire of the Emperour, that castinge howe to winne the fauour of his lady, already his tounge failed to speake, and his hearing to receiue that which she spake. She then all trembled, as knowing his purpose, &amp; through feare greatly desired to haue shunned that place, but the Emperour caught hir betéene his armes, and with such haste to ende his suite left hir vnfurnished of hir aunswere.</p><p>At that time as the burning beames of the Sunne began with his golden rayes to looke through the thicke Jessamines, al the fortunate aspectes intermedling their forces, at that time, by the grace of the Almightie, were begotten these two noble children, <name rend="roman">The Knight of the Sunne</name>, and <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>.

These two louers shortened the time with good agréement, vntill the Emperour at his departure tooke his leaue of hir to mounte vp the way hee came, and to retourne into his lodging.

He thought in himselfe, that if hee made peace with the king <name rend="roman">Tiberio</name> letting him vnderstand of the matter, the king would not accept of it, either for the great enmitie which was betwixt them, or for the bond wherein he was bound to the Prince of great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>.

parte from the reste, casting himselfe vppon the gréne grasse, &amp; staying his back against a trée, he there remained more thē two houres broad awake staring at y^e clearan<unclear>ess</unclear>e of y^e ayre, &amp; the brightnesse of the stars, when his thoughts renued, and the amorous passion, if before not cleane buried now reuiued a fresh by y^e solitarines of his conceipt: at length his cares, y^e wearinesse of his way, and the swéet noise of y^e pleasaunt leaues through the hissing of y^e winde, brought him in a gentle slomber: wherin he had scarc<unclear>el</unclear>y bene a halfe houre but that his fancie presented to <unclear>him</unclear> againe his Lady <name rend="roman">Briana</name>. He dreamed that she was <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/><corr>taken</corr> by <sic>sorce</sic> of two Giants, the most fierce &amp; strong that euer he had séene in all his life, and that she séeing him, cried for helpe. Through y^e griefe wherof he awaked very much afrighted: and in deede this dreame proued no game vnto him, for by and by he heard a great noyse neere vnto him, &amp; listening wher it might be, he beheld a faire chariot drawen w^t iii<unclear>j</unclear>. horses, &amp; in y^e top of it two great burning torches set in siluer candlesticks, by the light whereof he saw a Lady in the chariot clothed with rich &amp; princely robes, and resembling so much the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name>, that he verely beleued it was she. The gentlewoman leaning on hir elbow, and casting downe hir countenaunce, passed on stil sighing, as one enduring some great force &amp; torment. The Emperour prying about to sée who were the guides of the chariot perceiued that she was caried away by two strong and huge Gyants, with great battell axes in their hands, being on foote at the fore ende of the chariot. These two had so fell and cruel looks, that they would haue daunted the courage of any many which should haue beheld them. But the Emperour assured in his thought, that this was the Pricesse, with great anger start vp, and not remembring to call any of his knights, with his sword <unclear>he</unclear> paced towards the Gyaunts, where without either good euen or good morrow, he lent the first whom he approched vnto such a stroke, that the Gyaunt would haue morgaged his
<pb n="26" ed="digital"/><milestone n="[14L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
part in the Lady, to haue made sufficient paiment of that blowe, for lifting vp his battell axe to receiue the blowe, the sword cut it into the myddest of the helme, and from thence gliding downe vpon his armour hewed it into many peeces. Then y^e other Giant hastening to smite the emperour, layde at his head with mayne foce, but the Emperour wardid it on his sheelde, in which the Gyants battell are stacke so fast, that he might no more drawe it out, vntill the emperour strake him on the right arme, that he made him forgoe his holde. The two Gyants thus being left weponles, with much lightnesse, more then was liekly for their bignesse, leapt into the chariot, whereby the Emperour had no time to bestowe an other blowe on them. Then a dwarfe being in the one ende of the chariot, lasht foorth the horses, so that they ranne with such swiftnes as if they had flyne. With this noise the knights awaked, and with their swordes in their handes came to learne what it should be, in the ende much abashed to see their Lord in such a heat, as they demaunded of him what befell, he was so troubled in his heart, the Princesse thus being ledde away, that he made them no aunswere, but taking his horse, he commaūded them to folow him. The Emperour spurred his horse with such furie, that he made him to runne as fast, as the swallowe flyeth in the ayre. It could not be that the palfrayes which drew the chariot were horses, bicause his horse was one of the best &amp; most precious in the world, &amp; his Lord hauing desire to ouertake the Princesse made him gallop more then an indifferent pace, but the other were sprightes of the ayre, and infernall furies I thincke, forced by Arte Magicke both to fly and runne. Yet the Emperour folowed the chase, without loosing the sighte of them, although it was all in vayne. The knightes which remayned in the wood, being loth to be farre behind their Lorde, went to catche their horses, but were it that naturally they feared the Gyants, or that the wicked sprites had bewitched them, they all 
<pb n="27" ed="digital"/><milestone n="14     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
brake out of that place, and strayed héere and there, soe that the knightes spente more than two hourse ere they might take them. By this the Emperour was so farre from his knightes with the hast he made, that they knew not what waye to take, and in déede it was not possible for them to get within y^e sight of him, albeit they had held on y^e beaten way, which they thought that the Emperour had taken. They rode one waye and the Emperour belyke p<unclear>a</unclear>sied an other way, for they neuer met, but the emperour pursued so lōg vntil, in y^e ende he came to y^e brinke of the riuer <name rend="roman">Danubia</name>, there where it deuideth it selfe into fiue armes, at the shore wherof there was a goodly and tall shippe, as the Emperour might well see, being a bow shotte behind the Gyants. In this they put the chariotte &amp; withal hoysed their sailes, &amp; through y^e middle arme sailed with good spéede. This outraged y^e Emperour so that with spurring he caused his horse to fall downe dead vnder him. Being thus left on foote, notwithstanding he dispayred not, but helde on to that place from whence the chariot was taken, where he carefully lookt about him to see if peraduenture on the one side or on the other, hee might trace out a way to followe: so loathe he was to loose the sighte of it. But as all this was deuised by enchauntment, so lykewise it happened him to see a little shippe sayling in the riuer with greate swiftnesse: in the which there sate an olde man with a white bearde, by his countenaunce seeming to be a very honest man. To him y^e emperour called with a loude voyce, desiring him to take towardes the shore. The olde man which had the same thinge in charge, incontinently steered towardes him, and asked what he woulde haue. "That which I would haue quoth the emperour, is to be conuayed in thy ship, to that other ship which rideth before vs. For they haue in it stollen from me the thing which I loue best in all the worlde. This paines, if thou wilt take for me, I wyll so well contente thee, as thouh shalte thincke thy

trauaile well employed. Assuredly sayed the old man, I am content to doe it, bicause your courtesie induceth me to a greater hope of your merit." Saying this he guided his ship so néere the shore, that the emperour leaped vp into it, an being on the hatches, tourning him selfe to the olde man to geue him thancks, the olde man vanished away: and the Emperour neuer sawe him after. The shippe kept the same course that it began with, and the Emperour was much astonished at it, y^e rather for that he wist no man els aboord to rule y^e ship, not knowīg what els to say or thinck of this great wonder, he thē beséeched God so to direct his viage y^t he might yet obtein his lady: for he verly déemed hir to be <name rend="roman">Briana</name> which was in y^e chariot. In this order being stil w^tin sight of y^e former shyp, &amp; not staryīg frō y^e way which he had kept, the Emperour stayled thrée dayes and thrée nightes in the ryuer without any lacke of sufficient foode. By reason of thei trauell and thought, the meate which he eate was no more then would suffice nature. In the forth day by morning the ship with the chariot was driuen into the great and large Sea, called <name rend="roman">Pontus Euxinus</name>, through the which he yet sayled within the view of the other, vntill the forewarder shippe ariued in a fayre and delectable Ilande, where the chariot tooke landing. Halfe an houre after the emperours shippe rushed on the shore with such force that the shippe rent into péeces, and with the violence of the rush threw the Emperour vppon the bancke flatlings on his backe, where after he had stretched himselfe, he began againe to trauaile on foote that way which he gussed y^e chariot had gone. In this way straunge things befel him, as shall appeare in the chapter folowing.</p></div><div id="mirrour011" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The aduentures of the Emperour in folowing the enchaunted chariot.

Besides these, to make vp a full messe of disport, there was a swéete and pleasaunt song of birdes, which seemed to reioyce in the brighte and cleare morning, besides a thousand other pastimes which I let passe, to long to make a tale off. But yet of al these, y^e noble Emperour tooke no care, for the thought of his lady detained from him, but onely he beat all both knowen and vnknowen wayes, to finde out that wherein the chariot had gone. At length he winded one, but an vnvsed way, which by all lykelyhood was the same which he would haue, in that the grasse séemed new pressed downe. This tract the noble Emperour followed on foote, without y^t either the heauinesse of his armour or the length of the way, made him to rest any whit. From the morning a full halfe day the Emperour had continued his iourney, not méeting any person, at whome he might aske newes of that, which he most desired. But afterwards leuing the thicke and pleasaunt woode, he came into a faire gréene <unclear>or</unclear> medow full of roses and other swéet hearbs and flowers of all colours, without any other shade in all the medowe then those trées which serued for a hedge vnto it. The length of this medow séemed thrée bowe shotte vnto the myddest, where was situated a goodly castle, and in good proportion. It was foure square, hauing at eache corner a toure, and on euery side one in the middest of the side, all

of them so high as if they should haue edged with the clouds. This great castle was enclosed and shut in with a high and thicke wal, the stones whereof and the toures, dyd shine lyke Chrystel, or the well polyshed steele against the sunne beames. Rounde about the <sic>walll</sic> there was a déepe moate, the water being so broad, as a man might scare cast a stone from the one side to the other. Ouer the water there was a bridge, verie large and well toured so strong according to the depth of the water, that it might haue withstood a thousand men. Thrée toures it had in al, one in the enteraunce, an other in the middle, and the third at the furthest ende: each of them very high and greate, and wrought with the same stone, that the great castle was buylded with. The two outermost toures of the bridge, aswell the entry as that towards the castle, were gated and barred with dores and locks of fine filed stéele, being so shéene that it serued for a looking glasse vnto the passengers. The lockes were so shut, that vnleffe they were opened on y^e inside, it was vnpossible to vndoe them. The good Emperour scanned vpon all this, the like wherof he had not séene in all his life, and concluding fully that no such buylding might be made by mans hand, yet hee meruailed that of an Ilande so faire and delectable, there was no more noyse bruted especailly standing as it seemed to him in a sea so saileable. He beleued that the princesse was within, because there appeared to him no other building in all y^e Iland, &amp; therefore taking wide steps, hee passed on towards the gate of stéele, wher finding it closed, he toke a great hāmer hanging therby, &amp; bounsed at y^e gate with such force vpon the sounding stéele, that the fury of the rap was heard through all y^e toures, and a great part of y^e Iland. For all this none shewed themselues to make him aunswer, although he had stood more then a whole houre calling and knocking, at length with some trouble he departed from thence to coast the water, if perchaunce he might light vpon any other way into the castel. When

he had gone a tourne about, at one part of y^e wall he happened vpon a gentlewoman, which was in a little boate newly taking land at a little postern dore of yron, when y^e gentlewoman had taken footing on y^e lande, she opened the gates, making shew as if she would haue entred, leauring the vessell in y^e water. The Emperour strained his voice to call vnto hir y^t she should stay, but she feigning as though she heard him not, made to y^e wicket, wher as she was to fasten y^e doore: y^e Emperour cryed yet lowder, then she tourned toward him, &amp; as though she had but then espyed him, she sayd vnto him. "What would you haue sir knight?" The Emperour prayed hir to come néerer, for y^t he would onely demaund a certein thing of hir: with this she tooke hir boat againe &amp; with a little ower, rowed towards the land, wher the Emperour was: whᄓ she came somewhat nere y^e banck there staying, she sayd vnto him. "What is it y^t you would haue sir knight, in that you haue called mée so lowd. That which I would fayre gentlewoman, answered y^e emperour is y^t you would ferry me eyer in <sic>yonr</sic> boat vnto the castle, for y^t I haue to do with one of y^e Giants which are within. If you haue to dele with thē said y^e gētlewomā, they be no people on whom you <sic>way</sic> win honour. That is true said y^e emperour, I haue no desire to trouble them, if they wil do y^t which I require them. Sith it so said y^e gentlewoman I will do your commaundement, bicause you looke like a knight worthy of this seruice. I giue you great thanks for your courtesie" answered y^e emperour, &amp; with this he entred the boat, &amp; shouing with y^e rudder towards y^e castle he got thether. The gētlewoman went in, leading y^e emperour w^t hir, &amp; closed y^e dore after hir, cōducting him through a little court to an other priuie dore, which was not y^e cōmon entrie. She opened a wicket w^t a key which she had at hir girdel, &amp; brought him farther into a gardeine the most delightsōe y^t art might deuise. The emperour now tooke him selfe to be in a terrestrial paradise, &amp; gasing a while theren, w^tout remēbring y^e occasiō of his thether cōming he was so <corr>estranged</corr><ref target="mirrour011n1">[∗]</ref><note id="mirrour011n1" n="∗" place="foot">"estranged" in catchphrase only.</note><pb n="32" ed="digital"/><milestone n="[17L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
from him selfe. Out of this garden by an other dore, they came into a large courte of the castle, buylt with brighte Alabaster, the excellencie wherof in y^e ymagerie &amp; workemanshippe cannot be declared. For in comparison of this enchaunted Castle, either the sumptuous buylding of <name rend="roman">Mansolus</name> tombe, or the famous <name rend="roman">Pyramides</name> of <name rend="roman">Aegypt</name>, or the maze of <name rend="roman">Dædalus</name> making, founde in <name rend="roman">Crete</name>, may wel be forgotten. And as the Emperour mused on all this, the gentlewoman knowing him to be distraught, caught him by the hande, and brought him to a payre of stayres, the steppes whereof were all of Jasper, by them he mounted with hir into a chamber foure square, of the largenesse of a stones cast. In this yet she opened a nother dore, with three stepes of siluer plate, out of the goldsmithes shoppe, through which she brought y^e emperour into a more stately chamber, foure square as the other was and very rich, whereof the seeling and reofe were engrauen gold embossed with many precious stones, sending foorth such a light as it was meruaylous. The Emperour tooke no keepe of the riches of the place, but of the beautie of a number of faire gentlewomen whome he saw, sitting richly apparailed in euerie part of y^e chamber. Among these one seemed to be the principall, stalled in a seate highter then the other, and passing them all, so well in beautie as in rich apparel. She, as lady and mistres aboue them all, held in hir hand a Lute, whereon she played and sung together with such an harmony, that it was no lesse daungerous vnto the poore Emperour, then the alluring song of y^e Mermaides should haue bene vnto <name rend="roman">Vlysses</name> company. She sang swetly and she withal reached hir warbling notes so high and so shrill, that it much pleased the Emperour. Hir faire &amp; golden haire hung downe hir backe, and coured both hir shoulders. And you must pardon the Emperour if by this he was wholy possessed with hir loue, &amp; forgot his late wife the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name>. The entertainment was great, and yet this chaunge proceded not throuh the beautie of 
<pb n="33" ed="digital"/><milestone n="17     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
the enchauntresse, for his owne wife was much fairer, but rather by the secreate vertue of the place, which was therto deuised, accordinge as shall bee recited hereafter. By this time the Emperour had cleane loste the remembraunce of his wife, his Empire, countrey, and what els perteined to him, onely reioysing in the loue of <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name>, (for so thys Lady was called) this hee estéemed for his principall happe and good Fortune. When the Emperour has stoode stone still a while, this Lady rose from hir seate, and laying downe hir lute which shée helde in hir hand, with his gentlewomen wayting on hir, and with a good grace she made towardes the Emperour, to take him by the hand, saying vnto him. You are welcome most noble and worthy Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name>, for whose cōming I haue long time wished. The Emperour glad of such a welcome, &amp; making not straunge of his courtesy, albeit he could not finde wherby she should know his name, he aunswered hir. "Madame my arriuall cannot be but good, sith by it, I may beholde the pricke &amp; price of all this beautie in the world, consipiring as it were in your excellencie, and sith you receiue me with such fauour, I beséech you tell me who you are, least by not knowing you I might foreslow that duetie which I owe vnto your person.

They haue besides markes on their bodyes such as those which haue sene them, cannot tel what to thinck of them. The first borne of them hath on his lefte side the forme of a face very beautifull and so bright, that I dare liken it to the Sunne, which ouershadoweth the earth, and for the cause the little boy is called <name rend="roman">El donzel del Febo</name>. The other little boy hath betwéene his brests a Rose growing in the fleshe, so freshe of hewe, and so perfectly coloured that they which sée him saye he beareth the badge of his mothers bedde, as if he had bene borne in an arbour: for this token, they name him <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, I tell you madame so excellēt is their beautie that the best paynter in <name rend="roman">Hungarie</name>, neede no other example to drawe out the picture of beautie."

after nouelties, importuned <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> to deale herein, so that they all might enioy the sight of those two so rare children. <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> tourning toward hir Lady sayd, "by my faith, if my Lady the Princesse be so contented, I will go to my sister, and cause hir to come hether with hir little ones." The gentlewomen then besought the Princes that she would commaund them to be brought thether. The Princesse telling them that she did it more at their requeste, then of hir owne good will, sayd to <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name>, "you were best do this, which your felowes require you, my likinge you haue, for I my selfe woulde gladly be a witnesse of so great a meruaile." <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> toke hir leue of them hasting towards the citie, where hir sister dewlt and declared hir message for the bringing of the Princes. Hir sisters husband was a verie good gentleman borne, though very poore, he &amp; his wife made them redy to come before the Princesse, with the little Princes, which by this time were of some groweth, bring two yeares olde, hauing both goodly lockes, standing as it were vpon a iust temperature of grauitie and plesaunce. When they were come to the Pallaice, <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> first entred into the lodging, of y^e Princesse, being as yet in y^e company of hir gentlewomen, ther she led in by the hand the faire &amp; gratious <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. So soone as he was séene of the gentlewomen, they beleued him to be no lesse then an Angell of heauen, and that wherein <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> had before enstructed them, she had nothing deceaued them. The Princesse not hauing séene her children since hir first blessing of them, and now séeing the height of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with his beautie aboue hir hope, she made such ioye as might haue well bene discerned by hir countenaūce, but hir gentlewomē more attentiue of y^e beautie wher with God had inbued y^e yoūg <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, were not ware of it. <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> made the little boy bowe his knées to the Princesse, and whether it were nature, or the beautie of his mother, or both, so soone as he beheld his mother, he left the other gentlewomen.

Not longe after, ther entered <name rend="roman">Clandestrias</name> sister w^t hir husannd, leading by y^e hand the fairest among y^e most faire, <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>. At the sight of him the gentlewomen repented them of their former iudgement as concerning <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, that there might not be his like in all the world, in the ende, the question arising of comparison, to part the striefe they agreed, that as the one moued euery one to loue him tenderly by hys gracious behauiour, so the other by his modest iestures made them to feare him with reuerence. The difference onely put in this, that the one had more maiestie, y^e other more mirth and delight in his countenance. The princesse hauing <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> in her armes when she sawe hir other sonne before hir vpon his knees to kisse hir hande, with gladnesse she raysed him from the ground, and with <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> in one arme, tooke him on the other, kissing him vpon his chéekes, and in déede rather obeying the loue she bare vnto hir sonnes, then regarding the feare she was wont to haue for béeing discouered, albeit to say the trouth, the Princesse was of the better hand, for all the good will she shewed, hir gentlewomen imagined to procéede of their beautie. And yet to take all suspect away, she could very wisely moderate hir passions. <name rend="roman">Clandestrias</name> sister the supposed mother of those children, and hir husband by name <name rend="roman">Armaran</name>, kissed the Princesses hands, where she in token of good liking entertained them as hir seruants, frō thence foorth to remaine with hir, as their sister <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> did. On this wise the Princes were nourished in their mothers presence, without that any knew the right parentage whereoff they came, &amp; they so enticed the gentlewomen to the liking of them, y^t there passed not one houre, without playing and daliaunce with them.

For fortune euer mutable chaūged hir copie and became so contrary, that the date of hir ease béeing out, there succéeded discease and mishap, so that hir death shoulde not haue bene halfe so yerkesome as hir life was dolorous.

him, setteth it downe thus. That in the ende of a yeare, these two beautifull boyes béeing brought vp in the monastery of the riuer, with great pleasure of the Princesse and hir gentlewomen, one day in the moneth of <name rend="roman">May</name>, the comfort of the sunne there enforcing them to come abroad and séeke their solace vnder gréene boughes. The Princesse &amp; hir gentlewomen leauing their lodging, went into a large &amp; fayre orchard excéedingly well cast in one part of y^e monastery, there they tooke vp their seates at a wels mouth, ouershaddowed with trées, that the heate of the sunne could not annoy them, and sporting with the little <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, who was somewhat more giuen to play then his brother <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, they so much delighted in <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, that they toke no héede of <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, sitting not farre off. The little one being very young, yet greatly discontent to sée the small account they made of him, in a fume rose from the place where he was sette, and by <unclear>sof</unclear>t paces got from them, without béeing espied by the gentlewomen, sauing of his mother so called, whiche loued him no lesse then hir owne selfe. She rising from the place where she was set, followed him and tooke him by y^e hand laughing a good to sée y^e choler wherin he was, &amp; walking among the trées so long with him, that she came to a large and déepe water running through a part of the great orchard, where hard by were great store of trées, &amp; wether the Princesse bicause the place was very pleasant often resorted with hir gentlewomen to reioyse hir selfe. When they were there, the little boy seeing the water, was desirous to playe with it. The nourse, though otherwise willinge to haue contented him, yet fearing the daunger of y^e water went farther, to finde some sure place wherby to come vnto y^e water, &amp; taking a little boat at the banck, which y^e gardeiner vsed, in comming into y^e orchard put hir selfe in it, and the child with hir. The boy leaning his breast vpon the brimme of the boate, troubled the water with his handes &amp; tooke vp some to wash his face,
<pb n="52" ed="digital" entity="13801:20" pages="27"/><milestone n="[27L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
a while after the water béeing calme and plaine, he looked in it againe and séeing his shadowe there, he began to play with it, and stroke it with his handes, now bicause it would not hiue place, but did that which he did, waxing angry, he prayed his mother to giue him a rod which lay vpon the land to beate the babe withall. It was a good pastime for hir to sée the displeasure which he had conceiued against his owne shadow, and leauing him thus, she lept vpon the land to reatch him the sticke that he required. Béeing thus on land, either with the force she put to the side of the boate, in aduanceing hir selfe out of the boate, or els biscause it was the will of God that y^e little boy should then be prest to trie the hasard of his constellation. So it was, that the boat béeing vntyde, it shooued from the shore: The nourse not perceuing it before she tourned againe, then was it more thē two yards from the land, and not hauing whereby to take holde, it bare so swiftly downe the streame in a little time, and so farre of, that she lost the sight of it. When she sawe the daunger wherin the little childe was, not hauing power to succour it, she rent hir garmentes and tore hir haire, and fell to the grounde making suche mone, that the Princesse and hir gentlewomen sitting aboute the well, heard it, and much abashed rose form the place to knowe what the noyse meant. When they sawe the pitifull dealinges of the nourse vppon the grounde, quickning their pace, they gate néere hir, and demaunding the cause of hir great lamentacion, they founde hir so sorowful that shée coulde <sic>no</sic> speake to them, but rather the more shée was comforted by them, the more shée outraged in crying, as that they iudged hir to be distraught. So longe lasted these hir cryes, that the Princesse disquieted, went towards hir, leauing <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with one of hir gentlewomen: as y^e princesse came towards hir, y^e nourse knew hir, &amp; not hauing the boldnesse to shew how it fell out, in respect of the griefe y^e princesse would take for y^e losse of hir sonne,
<pb n="53" ed="digital" entity="13801:20" pages="27"/><milestone n="27     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
before the Princesse came at hir, she ranne &amp; lept into the water with full entent to drowne hir selfe, the which she had done, had not hir clothes borne hir vp, &amp; the gardener hearing y^e great outcries she made, waded in the water for hir, and brought hir to land all wet and bloudy with the blowes she gaue hir selfe in the face. This caused such pitie and compassion in the princesse and all hir gentlewomen that all astonished, they abode onely to sée the nourses demeanour. In the ende at the instance of the princessse she declared how <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> was got from hir, for the which they imparted with hir griefe, and especially the princesse beno<unclear>m</unclear>ed of all hir senses suncke to the ground with no more colour and breath then if shée had bene quite dead. The gardener extering into another boat there which he had to fish withall, pushed vp the streame amain <sic>wth</sic> his ower to ouertake y^e boat in which <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> was caried, but all his trauaile was lost, for either by diuine promission, or by Arte Magicke, made by a learned man, as shall be tolde you hereafter, the boat rode faster then the violence of the streame might driue it, &amp; in short time it entred into the great sea, where it followed y^e mightie waues more then 100 miles in a short space, so that neither the gardener nor who els followed them might in any wise atteine vnto him or bring newes of him. When the princes was reuiued, and remembred the chaunce of <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, she powred out so many salt teares from hir faire eyes, that like as out of fountaines or springs the water gusheth out aboundantly, so from hir face streamed downe flouds of water, issuing with sobs and sighes as would haue broke hir heart in a manner, such as commonly the fall of the water maketh from the stéepe mountaines. But for that she would not be hearde of hir gentlewomen, she tourned hir selfe and went towardes hir lodging, where remayning alone with <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> she gaue a fresh onset to hir former complaints on this sort.</p><pb n="54" ed="digital"/><milestone n="[28L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><p>"O mightie and souereigne Lord, wherefore doth thy highnesse suffer the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> to liue this long, seeing she doth roll on this life with such sorow and care? O Lord, wherefore gauest thou me a husband in this world so valiaunt, séeing that so soone as I had lost y^e name of a maiden, thou madest me an vnfortunate widow? Wherefore gauest thou me sonnes with so straunge tokens at their birth, if with so sodeine misfortune I shall lose the one of them, why did I reach to so great estate, in which I must liue with sorrow? and why gauest thou me beautie, not to enioy it? Alas poore woman that I am, I sée that each thinge enforceth my paine, for Fortune the mistresse of mishap, despitefully throwing downe those on whom she frownes, hath tourned hir backe on me, which desire to liue without y^e compasse of hir whéele. As séely woman, the longer I rub out this life, the more my griefe encreaseth. When I séeke to mollifie my griefe, then my care redoubleth, and one sorrow surceasing, ther succedeth an other, as one billow followeth on the others neck in the maine sea. O thou Lord which hath created me, take me out of this deceiptfull wourld, if by death onely the intollerable misfortunes may take ende which dayly await me." These and other woordes spake the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name>, much agréeuing therewith hir gentlewoman <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name>, who a little altering the course of hir aunswere from the platforme of the other complaint, droue with y^e princesse vnto these conclusions. First that there was hope inough to recouer hir losses, the reasons which lead hir thervnto were these. Albeit, saith she, Gods workes bée vnsearchable, yet thus bolde may we be with them, not inedling with the causes to compare the euils together, and then surely the whole course of worldly things sufficiently teach vs that God createth not such excellent personages but for excellent purposes, and not as in dombe showes vpon a stage, where the players onely present themselues and passe awaye. Againe, sayth shee, you
<pb n="55" ed="digital"/><milestone n="28     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
are altogether vncerteine of their death, and why not in so doubtful a case, should hope be as ready as rare, or perhaps you thinke as soone happens the worse as y^e better, yet the auncient prouerb is, that he which naught hopeth for, ought to dispaire naught, for hope and misgiuing are in the same subiect. Therefore sayth she, you may well hope. The second was, that she should comfort hir selfe, in the beautifull <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, who was then in hir kéeping, for saith she, he alone suffiseth to coūteruaile al y^e harmes which haue chaunced you. For I dare warrant if god preserue him, that you may name your selfe mother of y^e best knight in the world. With these, &amp; many other goodly coūsels, <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> dayly laboured y^e princes to giue ouer hir griefe, but for al this, if God w^t his mightie hand, had not helde hir vp it had gone wrong with hir. For he prouided hir comfort by a man very wise and well learned in Arte Magicke, of whō shal be made mencion in this historie. By him God permitted that the prison of y^e Emperour with other app<unclear>u</unclear>rtenaunces should be discouered, foreseeing by the signes, planets, &amp; other naturall operations, that which seemeth impossible vnto vs. Thus the truth is, that this wise man knowing the great sorow and care wherin the Princesse liued, &amp; wel perceiuing that vnlesse she had more succour at his handes then she had earst by other, biscause of that which befell hereafter, it shoulde be impossible to maintein hir life: determined in himself to comfort hir, &amp; so one day as she sate alone very sorowfull weeping with great aboundaunce of teares, neere vnto y^e well where hir two sons were begotten, he appeared to hir in y^e shape of a Nymph in y^e cléere &amp; christalin water, with y^e haire lose, &amp; shedding vpon y^e greatest part of y^e body, &amp; loith a face so beautifull y^t the princesse abashed to see hir, &amp; in some feare for y^t she had not séene the like before would haue fled frō thence. But y^e Nymph called vnto hir, saying, if y^u knewest noble princesse who I am, &amp; how wel I know thy great thoughts &amp; passions, y^u wouldest not flye

"from me but rather stay and talke with me. Now biscause the time affords me no leasure to tarrie with thée, and to discourse at large all the loyaltie I beare vnto thee, and the desire I haue to serue thée, in a woord I pray thee take good courage vnto thee, to ouercome the great aduersities which may come, and ere it be long are like to come vnto thee, so y^t thou shalt be left altogether comfortlesse. I giue thee yet to vnderstand that Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> is not nowe liuing, and that in the time wherein thy dispaire shall bee highest, thou shalt obteine thy husband againe, as safe and sound as he departed form thee, and he shall acknowledge thy children, and shall ioy in their vertues, y^t the ioy which thou shalt haue hereafter shall surmount the paine wherin thou remainest at this present. Assure thy selfe therefore that as all shall come to passe which I haue foretold thee, so were it good to keepe it in memorie, thereby to strengthen thy courage, the better to resist the malice of thy aduersary Fortune: whose wheele as it is rounde and in continall motion, so perswade thy selfe when it is at the lowest must needs tourne agayne vpwardes, and restore thee thy damages. Farewell, and hope no more to speake with me till all be accomplished which I haue sayd." In this sort preparing the Princesse to the conflict with hir aduersitie, the fayre Nymphe vanished away, diuing down into the depth of the well, and the Princesse deuising vpon this saying, as as it were besides hir selfe, not fully knowing whether she had heard these woordes, or dreamed them. For as she vnderstoode of the one parte, that Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> was dead, &amp; of the other, that she shoulde once again sée hir husbande, she was so confused in hir thought, that she knewe not what to iudge, and said to hir selfe, that peraduenture she had mistaken the Nymphe. In the end resting vppon the hope which she had made promise off, she was somewhat comforted, not doubtinge the accomplishment. Yet she remained in the monastery not willing to go out of hir lodging, and clothed alwayes

a young man but of a great courage, putting in his roome a viceroy for his kingedome, wandred as a knighte arrant through the world to seeke aduentures, wher he did great and noble déedes of armes.

Into it he entred, and in a little time he conquerred many cities playning townes and castells, all this while the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> being in <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>. The Péeres of his kingdome sent messengers vnto him, declaring the whole state of y^e coūtry, how vnable it was to make resist<unclear>au</unclear>nce, without the leuying of a newe army, and some for<unclear>r</unclear>ayne succours.</p><p>Then the Prince assembled the royallest army that he might in the lande of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and shipped into <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, there to giue battaile vnto <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, &amp; to punish by armes his enemies intrusion. But he reckened without his host. For he had not rode x. myles in hys owne kingdome when the mightie <name rend="roman">Africano</name> came and pytched néere with his whole army, and in the first fielde discomfited <name rend="roman">Florion</name> the most part of his people being slayne. The Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> hasted into <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, for euer dispairing to be reuested in his segniories, and <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> power was so great, that he well wotte al the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> power to be of little force to withstande him.

imprisonment, &amp; dispossessing the wicked intruder, should place the Prince <name rend="roman"> Florion</name> in his lawfull enheritaunce, to his owne great glory and the vtter confusion of his enemies. This done that <name rend="roman">Florion</name> should enioy his kingdome in peace and tranquilitie all his life, vntill then he requested them to haue patience, sith it is not yet saith he when these things shall happen.</p><p><name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> was helde for a very wise man, and they all beleued his saying, for that at other times he had deuined of many things which came to passe accordingly: but yet they knew not who that knight might be so strong as to resist the force of <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, for he was reputed the brauest &amp; most valyant knight of the worlde, &amp; they were very desirous euery day to heare of his arriuall in their lande. Now not a moneth after this the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name>, counsailed with the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> in secret willing him immediately at that houre to take xx. knights of the best he had in a warre shippe, as it wee to scowre the coasts. Wher sailing in the Sea <name rend="roman">Mediterraneum</name>, Fortune should bring vnto their power two little boyes the most beautifull and excellent that euer he had séene, with these sayth he you shall retourne to <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, for these are the nurses of your good happe. THe Prince glad to please his vnckle, chose out his knights, and tooke leaue of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, departing from <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, and passing through <name rend="roman">Asia</name> the lesse, he came to a hauen in <name rend="roman">Phrygia</name>, where he put himselfe and his mates in a ship well puruayed of vittaile, and lately rigged and trimmed for some such voiage. In this with a prosperous winde he sayled till at the ende of xij. dayes mounting on the tilbacke of the shippe to looke if perhaps he might behold the thing, of which the wise man had tolde him. It was so that he kenned a farre off a little barke in which the gentleman of the Sunne was driuing towardes them, and the wauer rocking it on eury side. It might be that this boate defended the burden naturallye,

as onely following the course of the waues: But I rather beleue that God which had created him with so wonderfull marks, tooke this care and kéepe of him, vntill that <name rend="roman">Florion</name> espying the barke comming righte towards him, and the gentleman in it so beautifull and bright as an Angell of heauen, no tounge can expresse the ioy that nowe he promised himselfe touching the perfourmaunce of that hope which <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> gaue him to repossesse his kingedome. His conceit also as concerning the beautie of <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> was, that some one of his celestiall gods had begotten him on some faire Lady here on the earth, as therefore as to a personage, which did participate with the deitie, he bowed himselfe, honouring and embracing <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, &amp; vpō his kées thancked his gods for y^e grace they did him in deliuering into his hands one w^t whom they themselues might ioy. The beautiful yoūg gentleman, which saw him so before him embased, feared him not a whit although y^e armour glittered, but with a ioyfull and pleasant countenaunce rolled him and clasped his armes about his necke, as if he had knowen him a long time. I doe not thincke that the desire of safety made him so to fawne vpō <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, for they with whom he was earst acquainted wore no armour. But the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> tooke him vp in his armes and kissed his white &amp; roseall chéekes as tenderly as if he had ben his owne childe, making him to eate of y^e most delicate meats which he had thē on boorde. The little boy which was very hungry fed very well, and from that time foorth loued the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> more then any other: as it is natural in man to preferre those of whome they receiue benefites. When the gentleman of the Sunne was well satisfied, the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> entred againe into his owne shippe and hoysed sayle toward <name rend="roman">Phryga</name> with a good winde.</p></div><div id="mirrour019" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ Prince Florion in his waye homewardes findeth by aduenture the young gentleman Clauergudo</head><pb n="62" ed="digital" entity="13801:23" pages="32"/><milestone n="[32L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><head rend="roman">sonne to the king Oristeo of Fraunce and bringeth him with the gentleman of the Sunne to Babilon.

For the Pilot directed ther course straight vpon <name rend="roman">Florions</name> ship, and in short space they ioyned together.

Then the bolde

There beganne a braue and terible battayle, either of their knights much amased in beholding thē. Now wel fare thy hart thou valyant <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, for thou much disappointedst <name rend="roman">Mambriniano</name> of his enterprise, &amp; madst him confesse that in twentie yeres robbing on the Sea, of so many as he might finde, he had neuer met knight which had put him in so great daunger, nor fought with one of so great force. Thus they fought halfe an houre &amp; no man might iudge who should haue the better. The great rouer strake with all this force at his enemy, (but the finall houre of his owne life nowe edging néere him) so it was that the couragious Prince auoyded it, &amp; as he as already entred into the good successe of his voyage, hauing in his power the gentleman of the Sunne, so fired all with wrath, his colour (as a man might say) bewraying his choler, he gaue the rouer with both hys hands such a blowe vpon the head that he felled him to the grounde, and before the rouer might get on his knees, he gaue him another betweene his helmet and his neckepeece, and layd him flat vpon the planks of the shippe. Ther the wretched <name rend="roman">Mambriniano</name> with his gluttonos desire spitte out his stincking and corrupted spyrite, and the noble <name rend="roman">Florion</name> rested not heere but with a braue and stoute courage entred in the shippe and layde about him on both sides. The knights of the rouer to reuenge their Lords death wounded him on <sic>all all</sic> parts, but by and by there boorded them the twentie knights of the Prince, all chosen men of war &amp; helped their Lord in suche wise, that in shorte time the greatest parte of their enemies were slayne, and the reste seeing their fall, yeelded themselues to his mercye. The battaile thus ended, the Prince would see what was

in the shippe for be beleued that there was within great riches according as the dealings of y^e rouer had ben. Ther was much treasure found, but searching euery place of it, they found in a cabbin a knight of an indifferent age clothed with rich garmets, and by his graue countenaunce seeming to be of good account, and néere vnto him a young gentlemen of foure or fiue yeares olde, very beautifull &amp; séemely arayed in cloth of golde and about his necke a coller of golde set with rich and precious stones. The young gentleman was so gratious in behauiour y^t if <name rend="roman">Florion</name> had not before séene the gentleman of the Sunne he had beleued him to be the fariest and properest gentleman that euer he had séene, and desiring to know who they were, he saluted them courteously, willing the knight to tell him who they were. He which had already knowne <name rend="roman">Florions</name> great vertue in the battaile that hee had with the rouer, rose with the young gentleman from the place where he was sette, and vsing an humble duetie to him aunswered, "Syr knight I am a prisoner to the rouer, <name rend="roman">Mambriniano</name>, which toke me and this young gentleman at a place nere a hauen of the Sea, and sith G O D by Fortune hath bene so fauourable vnto you, that in a righteous battaile you haue slaine him, we remaine now for yours to doe with vs that which shall seeme best vnto you, and we haue good hope that with a knight of so great valour, there cannot happen vnto us so much euill as with him which tooke vs prisoners." The Prince accepted well that which he sayd vnto him, and prayed him to go on in declaringe who he was, for that be lacke of knowledge he might foreslacke to doe to them the honour that they merited. Albeit nowe the knight wished that he might dissemble it for the daunger which might ensue, yet in the ende, putting his assiaunce in the Prince, he sayd vnto him. "Sith it lyketh you sir knight to know who we be only to please you I will tell it you, though I would gladly haue suppressed our names till Fortune somewhat more friendly

vnto vs should haue bewrayed it. But knowe you that this young gentleman is called <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, and is the sonne of the king <name rend="roman">Oristeo</name>, king of <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name>, onely inheritour and successour of that great kingdome, and I haue to name <name rend="roman">Armineo</name>, béeing brother to the king <name rend="roman">Oristeo</name> &amp; vnckle to this young gentleman. The whole order of this misfortune was in this sorte. One day for to sporte our selues in the company of many other knightes, we rode to a fayre forest néere vnto the Sea, and the knightes which came with vs, the most of them delighting in hunting, seuered themselues for their desport, in such manner that the young gentleman and I with onely x. knightes were left in a fresh and fayre harbour about a well, néere adioyning vnto the Sea. In this time while our knights followed their game, this great Rouer <name rend="roman">Mambriniano</name> whether espying vs, or by chaunce taking lande for fresh water, wée knowe not, but with more then .xx. knightes he beset vs, and alhtough wée defended our selues sometime, in the ende, this gentleman and I were taken prisoners, and our .x. knightes slayne and sore wounded before the other knightes which hunted in the forest might vnderstande of it. He carryed vs to his shippes where it is more then a moneth y^t wee haue ben in this maner as you haue seene vs, close pent vp in this cage. For my selfe Sir, as I neuer hope for libertie, so I respect not my imprisemnent, but for this fayre young gentleman my heart is sore wounded. I had rather suffer .x. deathes, then any such misfortune should happen to him. Biscause that when such newes shall be reported to hys father, he will feare it more impatiently then his owne, &amp; that which worst is, to me onely will he attribute this fault, sith hauing committed his onely sonne to my gouernaūce, I haue giuen so ill account of him," vnto these words y^e knight lent many a teare slyding down his face, which well shewed y^e griefe he bore in heart. The prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> in great compassion comforted him, promising libertie of

retourne into his countrey when he would, but by and by remembring the wordes which the wise man his vnckle had sayd, he called it backe againe, and in stéede of his first promise, he tourned his tale to the narration of his owne mishaps, being on this wise. "I thanck you hartely for your courtesie, in recounting to me the whole discourse of your imprisonment, and of this young gentlemans captiuitie, and I call y^e high Gods to witnesse, what paine your misfortune hath caused in me, and howe ready my power shalbe to remedy it when I may. For I meane to giue you libertie of retourne, and with my men to conduct you homewardes into <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name>, thus much occasioned in mée by the deserts of your estate. But Fortune hath bene so contrary to me, that except your retourne be delayed, I my selfe shall want my necessary helpe, the whole state of the matter lying thus, if it so please you to heare, I am by the name <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, king of <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, my father deceasing whiche was king thereoff, &amp; so by iust title as to his onely sonne and heyre, y^e crowne of y^e kingdome descended to me. This charge I susteined in mine owne person a good while, but being young and lustie, and in good age to followe armes, I was desirous to wāder in y^e world. So leauing a gouernour in my kingdome I trauailed through diuers coūtries vntill y^e ende of thrée years, at which time I tooke ouer into <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, where I was matched with y^e daughter of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> béeing mine vnckle.

But one myne vnckle, a very wyse &amp; learned man in Art Magicke, recomfort me saying, that the time should come, in
<pb n="67" ed="digital"/><milestone n="34     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/> 
which I should be restored to my kingdome with great honour, &amp; y^t for this it behoued me to await on y^e sea, till I met w^t two little boies of excellent beautie: with whom I should retourne to <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, for that they should bée the principall cause of my redresse, and so giuing credit to hys word, I thus put my selfe in aray, for this aduēture, where thanckes be to the Gods, all hath sucéeded as y^e wiseman forespok it, for within this thrée daies I lighted vpon one béeing alone in a little boat, hauing in him according to my fancie, the very pride of all beautie, and the other must néedes be this young gentleman <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> y^t fairest be side him y^t euer I knew, so as I haue good hope hereby to reēter into my kingdom. For this cause I haue in charge to bring these two to <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, &amp; now sir knight I beséech you to take it in good part, for he shal be as wel entertained in y^e court of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> as in y^e court of the king his father, &amp; when my good fortune wil y^t my seat shal be established, he &amp; you shall retourne into <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name> w^t my ships, &amp; my people, &amp; my selfe also if it be so conuenient. When y^e prince had here stayed, <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> was wel contented with his talke, taking him for a knight of great prowesse, &amp; althought y^e long stay y^t y^e prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> should make in this countrey gréeued him: yet with hope to retourne in the ende, séeing it was not in his power to doe otherwise, he subiected his will to tbe princes commaunde, &amp; with courteous woordes rendred him thanckes for the storie of his aduentures, &amp; for y^e offer he had made theē, y^e pith of his aunswere being in few words this. Be it as you haue said syr, for I denie not but y^e gentlemā <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> shal gaine very much by his bringing vp in yours &amp; your vnckles so noble a court.

yeares but tooke him rather to be a celestiall <name rend="roman">Seraphin</name>, then an humaine creature, and beleeued that this might not be done without some great misterie, as if y^t younge gentleman shewinge in hys infancie the comelinesse of stature, and other excellent qualities wherewith he was endued, besides the straunge findinge him alone in the rage of the tempest, dyd well foreshewe his nobilitie in time to come. But when they sawe him naked and the portrature of the Sunne, with the brightnesse that it gaue to the beholders, it was so straunge that they caled to minde <name rend="roman">Phaetons</name> fall out of heauen, comparing thys younge gentleman with <name rend="roman">Phaeton</name> as if he had bene <name rend="roman">Phoebus</name> sonne, like as <name rend="roman">Phaeton</name> was, although somewhat diuers, agayne in this for that <name rend="roman">Phaeton</name> taking his fathers chariot, for his presumption was drenched in the Sea, this younge gentleman was preserued in the Sea, as betokeninge some greater secrecie in Nature. <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> was best apayed to haue the companie of so excellent a gentleman for the Prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>. Now by y^e way this may you learne, y^t although they could not tell <name rend="roman">Donzels</name> name, yet by the tokens he had vppon him, they named him the gentleman of the Sunne, somewhat in other tearmes in the <name rend="roman">Persian</name> tongue, but in signification, all one with the name that his mothers gentlewoman gaue him in <name rend="roman">Hungary</name> beeing worth the markinge that both <name rend="roman">Persians</name> and <name rend="roman">Hungarians</name> shoulde so iumpe in naminge him.

These things thus done, they all held on their way to y^e citie, &amp; passing through towards y^e pallaice, there they were receiued by <name rend="roman">Balisea</name>, princesse and wife to <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, making semblaunce of great liking to <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, whose excellent beautie and comlinesse she wel noted, and already concluded in hir thought for a companion to hir sonne now of thrée yeare olde very large and beautifull called <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>: Which in déede after proued a knight so good, as fewe better, béeing strong made, somewhat higher then his father, &amp; of more puissaunce. These thrée gentlemen by the Princesse <name rend="roman">Baliseas</name> deuice were brought vp altogether in like suites, and like exercises, &amp; so from their youth their friendship encreased with their yeares, that in the ende, as they themselues were at their full growth, so their friendship waxed so firme, y^t neither the diuersitie of thir  professions, nor the distaunce of their coūtreys might in any wise enfringe it. These young gen-

tlemen thus brought vp in <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> which in al things was very wise &amp; well learned, taught <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> the liberall Artes, and instructed him in the true &amp; perfect lawe of God: in such manner that although his education was among the <name rend="roman">Pagans</name>, yet the Prince was alwaies a good christian. The wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> likewise carefull of the gentleman of the Sunne, &amp; of <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, read vnto them diligently what was cōuenient, saue that as he was a <name rend="roman">Pagan</name>, so hee acquainted them onely with <name rend="roman">Pagansie</name> in their religion: Which errour notwithstanding afterwarde they both renounced. This was the trayning vp of the young princes in the court of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, as héedfully looked vnto, as if it had bene in their parents courtes. But as their yeares multiplied, so they excéeded, all other inferior in iudgment, wit, discretion, goodlinesse of stature, actiuitie, and al that which was requisite to such princes, but especailly and aboue all his equales, <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> surpassed. For atteining to the age of x. yeares, hee séemed to bee more then xv. both for witte and strength, courage and policie, and by the bignesse of his body (béeing withal well featured) men gathered vndoubtedly of his might. They made their argument thus. If he be so strongly set in his youth at x. yeares, what will he bée at xx. And truely although his father the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> was big of body, as the historie hath already specified, béeing .viii. foot in height, yet <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> ouerreached him somewhat, &amp; with al this mainteined y^e prerogatiue of his proportiō. So y^t I thinck our painters as well <name rend="roman">Grecians</name> as <name rend="roman">Assirians</name> had neuer the perfect knowledge to drawe and finish y^e true proportion of man, before they had the view of this knight. His picture was sent into sundry parts as y^e noblest paintur y^t ere was wrought. Besides this, ther appered in his face a maiestie so graue &amp; princelike, y^t it stroke a feare of him into mighty Princes. For all this, he was yet of behauiour affable &amp; somewhat familiar, y^t he which <corr>knew</corr><ref target="mirrour020n1">[∗]</ref><note id="mirrour020n1" n="∗" place="foot">"knew" in catchphrase only.</note><pb n="72" ed="digital" entity="13801:26" pages="37"/><milestone n="[37L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
him well, albeit his mortall enimie could not but highly commend of it. What shal I say? as the Adamant stone draweth to it the hard and sharpe yron by his hidden vertue, so likewise this knight procured the loue, as well of foes as of friendes, and of as many as knewe him and were conuersant with him. And so this younge gentlemen <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> and <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, and other younge gentlemen which were his playfellowes were so gladde of him, that they could at no time be without him. Nowe bicause we haue more perticulerly to descende into this storie hereafter, and <unclear>t</unclear>o describe the manifolde graces of this knight, for these matters we will let them passe at this time, and remember you of his age of xij. yeares, at which time there happened that which shall appeare in the Chapter following.</p></div><div id="mirrour021" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The deliuerie of the Souldan by the gentleman of the Sunne. Cap. 19.</head><p>MAny times the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, with some other knightes for their recreations, rode on hunting into a thicke wood standing in a faire forest seated somewhat néere the Sea, and plentifull of all kinde of game, especailly of wilde boares and such like beastes. Nowe when the young gentlemen could sit their horses and were able to endure some trauaile, they tooke them with them, and furnishing them with boare speares in their handes, they appointed them to the chase. Some game ther was killed before them, wherin they toke great pleasure: but especially y^e gentleman of y^e Sunne, which by himself wearied a wilde beare, &amp; two boares so féerce as might haue frayed a right good knight. His practise was alwayes to hunt alone, to haue no mans helpe to the encounter with any wilde beast. And it was so, y^t one day the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> would go to the same forest to delight himselfe, there for certeine dayes taking with him the Prin-

cesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name> his daughter, and the traine of many Ladyes and gentlewomen and the most principall Lordes of his courte, biscause the place was gallant and delectable, and replenished with variety of game, being as I sayd hard vpon the cliffes of the Sea. For this cause there were rered vp many pauilions there, and there was puruayed of other prouision necessary for the housholde. He made his owne tent to tbe pitched in a flourishing medowe next to a goodly fountaine. Ther rested he one day solacing him selfe among his knights, for the first day they wente not out to séeke their game. The next day earely in the morning the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, the young gentlemen and the most part of all the knights tooke their way through the forest climing vp a stéepe hyll, and parted themselues into diuers companyes, some to rayse the game, and others to be at the receipte. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the Princesse with hir Ladyes, and only xv. knights remaining in their tents as vnmindefull of any daunger if any shoulde happen. The Sunne being almost at the highest and his beames more direct, the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> with the Princesses his daughter and hir gentlewomen lefte their tent and came to the fountaine the water being cléere and the place well shadowed with trees, there in the quyet shade to abide the comming of the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> and the young gentlemen to dinner. In the meane time the gentlemen sewers prepared the cupboorde and the cookes made ready for dinner. The tables being spredde vpon the greene grasse and euery man attentiue to his function, the officers to their charge, the knights to their game, and the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> with the Princesse and Ladyes to refreshe themselues in the coole ayre: there came in place a mightie and wofull Gyant, with more then twentie knyghts after him. The Ladyes scréeched out, but ther was no remedy. For the Gyant with his knights toke the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, the Princesse, and most of the gentlewomen and conuayed them into a chariot drawne by strong horses which they brought with

them for the same purpose, with the outcries of the Ladyes the knights which were in the text issued and séeing their Lord and the Princesse with hir Ladyes so carryed away perforce (albeit this they did more for shame then through hardinesse, yet) they made towardes the Gyant with their swordes and began to compasse him about, but they so ill perfourmed their duetie that in short time them selues were either wounded, slaine, taken, or put to flight, and their Lord for lacke of rescewes was bound and fettered. The Gyant hauing his praye withall the hast he might tooke towarde the Sea, where he had a good shippe in redinesse. The lamentable noyse which the Ladyes made was such that it beat through y^e ayre vnto y^e skyes and yet could not penetrate so farre as to Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> or his knights, either that they wer so eager in the pursute of their wilde boares that they marked it not, or that the crye of the hunters was so lowde, that it drowned the other. But the young gentleman of the Sunne, losing his company, and well mounted vpon a lyght horse with a borespeare in his hand, being also clothed in a hūters wéed of gréene cloth of golde, and a hat to kéepe downe his yelowe haires, roade roming about the woode to séeke some beast vpon whom he might try the stéele of his boarespeare, and taking his way and that way without staying in any place, he mette with a knight sore wounded by the Gyant, which roade piteously to call the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> and his knights for succour to the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> &amp; the Princes. As <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> saw him thus arayed he asked what he ayled. "Alas gentleman of the Sunne said y^e knight, y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> our Lord and the Princesse are taken prisoners by an vgly &amp; monstrous Gyant, &amp; by the hast he maketh, I gesse he is already néere the Sea." The gentleman of the SUnne much lamented such newes, &amp; with a noble &amp; heroycall courage which by nature nowe enforced it selfe forward, he prayed y^e knight to guide him on y^e way, towards y^e Gyant. The knight thinking it an vnfit match &amp;
<pb n="75" ed="digital" entity="13801:27" pages="38"/><milestone n="38     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
beside his purpose to turne back with him, for he thought him to young for such an enterprice would not staye, but rode on faster. The gentleman moued with this that the knight set so little by him yet said nothing, but not tarying for more company broched the horse with his spurs, y^t he made him spin y^e same way in which he had sene y^e knight before. The hast he made is incredible, for before y^e Gyāt had recouered y^e sea, he ouertooke him in a playne amonst his knights &amp; the chariot in y^e midst. The Gyāt was hindmost on foot, with a great battell axe of stéele in his hand so y^t it might haue dismayed one to sée his fierce &amp; cruell demeanour. When y^e gentleman of y^e sunne had got a sight of him with greater force then before he spurred his horse making way through y^e gréene medow as fast as if he had bene driuen by the rage of tempest &amp; thunder, and crying aloude. "Stay, stay." The Gyant and his knights hearing the noyse that he made and the sound of the horse féet galloping in such hast, turned their heades aside to sée what it ment, &amp; amongst the rest y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> likewise looked behinde him, and espying him to be y^e gentleman of y^e sunne with only a boarespeare in his hand, he much pitied hys case, for he thought surely <name rend="roman">Donzel</name> should neuer escape death or duraunce. The lothsome Gyant wondering at the young gentleman comming toward him, with great fury lifte vp both his hands to his head, and there staying on foote as he was, made a fierce and sterne countenaunce of disdayne till the young gentleman approched. But the noble &amp; valyant <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> borne for the achieuement of greater aduentures, with a furious moode as it had bene thunder drew nere, and with his boarespeare in his hande being very strong, sharp, and well stéeled with all his force he shoued it into y^e breast of the Gyant, that although he had a breastplate of fine steele a finger thicke yet the speare entred, and issued out at y^e shoulder all begored with bloude. Thus the Gyant fell downe deade on the grounde to the greate abashement of all those
<pb n="76" ed="digital" entity="13801:28" pages="39"/><milestone n="[39L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
which saw him, iudging that <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> had bene then let downe from heauen to doe this feate, for in their fancies, not the thunderbolte which by the renting of the cloudes driueth the windes before it, might euer giue a more sodayne or more forcible blowe then that which <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> gaue the Gyant, espcially the knights of the Gyants retinue not witting who he was, imagined that their owne gods had sent him downe from the heauens for the more notable chastisement of their Lordes crueltie. Now some of the knights hearing a rushing, a farre off in the woode, and thincking it to be the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> people, their maister thus slayne, without hauing care of chariot or prisoners, tooke them to their héeles with more hast by halfe then good spéede. For one letting the bridell slippe, and for feare not able to guide his horse, by the stumbling of his horse had so sore a bruse, that his horse rising, he laye still on the ground tormented with the fal. And those which got to the Sea, themselues being past daunger nothing sorowed at the death of the Gyant, for they hated him, &amp; serued more by compulsion then with good will. This trouble in the Gyantes men made the gentleman of the Sunne make no account of them. Wherefore alighting from his horse, he went towardes the chariotte where the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> was, with the Princesse and Ladyes and vnbounde them. The Ladyes when they sawe him, were no lesse gladde of the proofe of armes in <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, then of their owne deliuerie. But the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> embrasing him &amp; kissing him with great loue, sayd vnto him.</p><p>"Oh my sonne now I know assuredly that the mightie gods highly fauour you, &amp; that onely by miracle you haue ben brought to <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> as to giue succours to me &amp; to my children. Now doe I firmely beleue my brother <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name>, who long before prophecied of the great meruailes of your valour, sith that being so young and tender and in the maydenhead of your strength, it being neuer before

tasted vpon an enemye, you haue begunne so well as I haue knowne no knight in his perfection machable. And truly this is the accomplishment of your first aduenture, as my brother foreseeing it tolde me, that you should rescew me and my daughters from death or imprisonment, and I hope as well in the immortall gods y^t the second shalbe lykewise finished, that is, the kingdome of <name rend="roman">Persia</name> so long withhelde by the false vsurper, may by you be redelyuered to the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>. My Lord aunswered <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, I haue not as yet done the thing in your service neither in my lyfe may hope to compasse which may counterpaize with my good wil in this behalfe, and truely the duetie which I owe to your good grace my Lorde, to the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, and to my Lady the Princesse your daughter, dayly so augmenteth as more then that duetie I cannot owe vnto my father, to the discharge whereof, notwithstanding I stande bounden to your goodnesse, not onely of courtesie but in conscience," and so humbled himselfe before the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>: but the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> againe embraced him and they two helped the Ladyes out of the chariot. The Ladyes were desirous to know who the Gyant was, &amp; what should be the cause why he so assayled them. Therfore the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the gentleman of the Sunne, made toward the knight of the Gyant which was falne to the grounde, and as they tooke of his helmet to giue him ayre, they fetcht him out of his sounde and setting him on his feete they demaunded of him who the Gyant was and why he came to take them prisones. The knight seing it behoued him to say the troth made aunswer shortly thus. "You shall vnderstande my Lordes that this Gyant was called <name rend="roman">Brandafileo</name> Lorde of the toured Ilande, which is in the great <name rend="roman">Ocean</name>, at the mouth of the redde Sea. This Ilande is so stronge and inuincible that being within he néede not feare all the worlde if they had bent their force against him, &amp; being proude vpon the safetie of this Ilande he did much wrong to the nations round
<pb n="78" ed="digital"/><milestone n="[40L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
about him spoyling and robbing all <name rend="roman">Arabians</name>, <name rend="roman">Aethiopians</name>, <name rend="roman">Aegyptians</name>, and the <name rend="roman">Garamants</name> of <name rend="roman">Inde</name>, and finally so many as he might come by in the great west seas, and so the Ilande of <name rend="roman">Traprobne</name>, and by long continuaunce in this trade of rouing he is become so rich of captiues and treasure that no Ilande is comparable with his. Now the cause wherfore he came into this your lande was, for that in the time y^t the mightie <name rend="roman">Orixerges</name> your father reigned in <name rend="roman">Persia</name> the father of this Gyant called <name rend="roman">Briontes</name> then being Lorde of the toured Ilande, by occasion of <name rend="roman">Briontes</name> euill life, your father and he fell at variaunce, wherefore the king your father sent out his whole nauy to subdue this Ilande but being not able to conquer it, he gaue them notwithstanding in charge to lye in the outcréekes awaiting when he came foorth from the Iland &amp; so to set vpon thē. One time y^e Gyant making a road out for a lyke cheuisaunce a farre off from his owne Iland, the king your father dogged him with his shippes, and as he reto<sic>n</sic>rned met him in y^e halfe tourne &amp; (for all the hauocke he and his made of your fathers souldiers) in the ende killed him. This <name rend="roman">Brandafileo</name> his sonne then being a childe of tender age, yet so soone as he was of yeares to be made knight he greatly longed after y^e reuenge of his fathers death, &amp; bicause he coulde not worke his mischiefe on y^e king <name rend="roman">Orixerges</name> being then deade, at the least it would case his stomacke, if he might wreake himselfe on you his sonne, and for this cause many times he hath sente spyes into your lande to be aduised by them when he might haue opportunitie of vēgeāce, &amp; learning of your cōming to this forrest for your disport, he hath now layne more then a mōth in secret expectatiō of so good lucke as to take your persō. This time he had found to his contentation had not thys gentleman bene, who now hath made sufficient paye to <name rend="roman">Brandafileo</name> for his months hire." This is all my Lorde which I can tell you as to your demaunde, and it is truth which I haue tolde you, as I certeinely beleue, that if euer

he had cleane carried you from hence you should not haue esaped from death or bondage, for so he had determined. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> mused at y^t which y^e knight had told him, and waying y^e great daunger wherin he was like to haue faln, he ceased not to giue thancks to his gods &amp; to the gentlemā of y^e sunne for his safetie. At this time Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> came with more then .xxx. knightes running their horses so fast as they might, bicause already they had heard the newes, &amp; comming where y^e Gyant lay dead, viewing well the wide &amp; mortall wound, they highly commended of it, and coulde not iudge by whom he had receiued it: but very ioyfull to sée y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> &amp; his Princesse out of daunger, leaping from their horses they came towards them. Then <name rend="roman">Florion</name> excusing his long absence by y^e ignoraunce of the fact, desired to knowe who he was which had so gently bayled them from y^e Gyant. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> aunswered on this sort. "Ah, <name rend="roman">Florion</name><name rend="roman">Florion</name>, now we know your vnckle <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeos</name> diuinations, as touching this gentleman of the sunne to be sooth and stedfast, for we haue well aproued his valour, &amp; know you y^t he alone, being y^e only man which came to succour vs brought to grounde the Gyant <name rend="roman">Brandafileo</name> by one only blowe with his boarespeare, riuetting as you sée his coatearmour, and ridding vs from so daungerous a foe, making his entrance to knighthood y^e strangest y^t euer was heard. <name rend="roman">Florion</name> giuing back either as wōdring or not credeting  his vnckles speach, was still vrged by y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> who tolde on forward as <name rend="roman">Brandafileos</name> knight had cōfessed. <name rend="roman">Floriō</name> yet as it wer halfe in a māmering which part to take betwen y^e gētlemās youth &amp; his courage disputed rather y^e impossibiliitie by means of y^e hugenes of y^e Gyant, his strong armour, &amp; the number of his knights, in y^e ende he ouercame himselfe, by remēbraunce of <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeos</name> report, &amp; thancked the gentleman on this wise. "O my right noble &amp; beloued sonne, I graunt that not my force, but the mightie windes and swelling waues by the ordinaunce of my Gods, haue gyuen me

power ouer you, for that by your souereigne bountie the wronge which is done to me by the tyrant shalbe reuenged, and I shall recouer mine owne kingedomme. O how happy was the day and the houre fortunate in which I found you, sith my gods haue reserued you for so great benifites towardes me and the relese of mine vnckle," with these and many other words <name rend="roman">Florion</name> wept for great pleasure to thincke of <name rend="roman">Donzels</name> magnanimitie. And in this time the other young gentlemen his companions came riding from hunting, and sawe the fierce Gyant lye dead by the way they enquired after the manner of his death and hearing it to be as you haue heard, y^e one tooke great pleasure in it, and the other with an honest emulation of the fact wishing it to himselfe, according to the diuersitie of the good will they bare vnto the gentleman of the sunne. Then they came altogether to their tents, where they made but a hunters breakefast, for ere dinner was halfe done the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> commaunded to horse to retourne to <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, and so they all on horseback the Princesse and hir gentlewomen on their palfrayes, &amp; the lustie knights on their sturdy Rounceualls, tooke the way towards the citie, laying the mightie Gyant vpon a horse, his head and feete trayling on the grounde.</p><p>When they were within the gates of the citie, all that which had happened being published, all the citizens and other of the courte wer in countrary arguments about the hugenesse of the Gyant and the courage of the gentleman of the Sunne thinking it an impossible matter to be brought about by one of so few yeares. But from that time foorth, (although before likewise they loued him) yet nowe they made much more of him, and the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> with the Princesse and all the courtiers helde him in great account alwaye. Notwithstanding the report of men, and the high extolling of his actes to his owne face, the gentleman of the Sunne kept the same tenour of life, not bearing himselfe any thing vpon his good fortune, but rather

as the windes encreased which promised him safetie &amp; honour, and as his fame was more blased, so he stroke hys sayles &amp; became more lowlier. This his humilitie made him much more to be loued, as the sprinckling of water augmenteth the flame in a smithes forge: <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> at this time egged on by <name rend="roman">Donzels</name> good hap, and béeing of riper yeares sued to be made knight. But the wyse <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> foreséeing somewhat, and to haue him kéepe company with <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, and <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> withstood his purpose for that time. <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> was but about .xiiij or xv. yeares of age, but he was so comly and nimble in all feates of armes, that there was not a knight in all the court which outpassed him. In this manner were these two gentlemē brought vp in y^e <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> court, with great magnificence as if they had bene in their fathers courts, &amp; aboue all, they were so throughly enstructed in learning, that ther were none able to come in controuersie with them, al this equal to both, notwithstanding the difference of beléefes which shall be a like ere it be long. <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> which was guided by <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> his unckle, was a christian: and the gentlemen of the Sunne beléeued in the lawe of the gentils, as the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> had taught him. <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> himselfe béeing bred and brought vp in the same errour by his father, for all his great cunning was not able to finde out the vanitie of hys false Gods. O the prouidence of God howe much be wée bound to thée, and howe ill doe wée acknowledge thy great goodnesse in suffering vs to be become christians, when thousandes wise men and myghtie monarches dye in y^e lawe of the gentils, not all their power auaileable to saue their soules, and their learning not worth a rushe for the displaying of the falshoode of that lawe, wherein their Fathers haue nousled them. And shall wee Christians thincke that our knowledge can pull vs out of hell, if not the wysest of the earth, I meane the learned gentils could once reproue their owne lawe
<pb n="82" ed="digital" entity="13801:30" pages="42"/><milestone n="[42L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>

This Lady was led by a knight great of body well and strongly proportioned, and armed at all pointes with a rich and strong armour. This knight lifting vp the visor of his helmet, shewed himselfe to the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, where they perceiued his face to be very foule and fearefull, of coloure more tawnie and sunburnt, then cole blacke, hys eyes flaminge in his heade, his nostrels wide and large, broade lippped, and his sharpe fanges issuing out of his mouth like boares tuskes, and reaching to his chinne, so that there was no man liuinge but might haue bene <sic>afraied</sic> of hys fierce semblaunce.

selfe cruell and aduerse to mee, that shée onely not suffised with the death which my father and mother, and many of their subiectes haue receiued for my sake, she ceaseth not dayly to afflict me, and to bring me to so lowe an eb, that being defeated of mine owne inheritaunce, I am yet faine to wander through the courtes of mightie princes to finde some good and pitifull knight, which bewaylinge my mishap, will ease me of the great trauaile I dayly take to saue my honour. For if you will suffer me to lay open my case, the whole storie is thus. I am right enheretrix of y^e Iland of <name rend="roman">Cypres</name>, where my predecessors reigned long time with much ioy, vntill that their good hap was hindred by my beautie. For hauing brought me into thys world, with y^e beautie wherin you see me, which I would to our gods had either perished when I first was swadled, or els had neuer bene knowen, that none might haue taken delight in it, so soone as my beautie was sounded abroad, this knight heere present, king of the <name rend="roman">Zardians</name>, Lord of the Iland of <name rend="roman">Zardia</name> called <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, hearing of it came to sée me, and so soone as he came, he was taken with my loue, and demaūding me for wife, was denied it of my father. Wherfore very angry retourning to his Iland of <name rend="roman">Zardia</name>, with a great army of knights he came against my father, &amp; at the first field killed him and murthered al his people, and in short time became Lord of <name rend="roman">Cypres</name>, my mother séeing my father dead, and hir land wasted, dyed for griefe. I remained alone without company till suche time as <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> came to the pallaice where I was. I knew to whose power I was become seruaunt, &amp; fearing that he would haue forced me, determined by endinge my life to make my selfe frée from his subiection, estéeming it farre better to die with my parentes, then aliue to bewaile their deathes, and hauing no better leasure nor meanes to achieue my purpose, I leaped vp to a window  the highest in all the pallaice, thence to haue throwne my selfe downe, if <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> seing me in this plight had not

prayed me not to doe it, promising if I forbeare that, to doe the thing that I commaunded him. I resoluing vpon death told him y^t vnlesse he graunted me one gift, I would be mine owne executioner: he to saue my life, promised it wherby I left off from putting y^t in practise which I had contriued in my thought. By this meanes <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> had me in his power, &amp; hauing the whole Iland at his commaundement, hee carryed me contrary to my will into his owne countrey, with these aged knightes my néere knsmen, there he requested me of loue, and praied me to accept of him for husband. What should I doe he was importunate in his demaund, &amp; I remained in his daunger so that to put by the execution of his desire, I had none other remedy but to aunswer him that so soone as he had performed the promise which he made mée, I woulde satisfie his whole entent. This hearing he was wel content, and so I tolde him that hee should carry me for the space of a xij. month into all places whether I would, &amp; if in the meane time I founde a knight to defende my right by fighting against him, he should graunt the battaile with condition, that if my knight vanquished him, I should be frée frō his demaund, and my land at quiet, otherwise if he had the vpper hand, I from thence foorth to be at his commaundement, and he doe what euer liked him. This knight most noble <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, counselling with his strength, and thicking all mens vertues inferiour to his, tooke vpon him the quest, glad by such meanes to manifest his power, and so he carryed me from the Iland <name rend="roman">Zardia</name>, more then halfe a yeare past, in which time yet I haue not founde a knight to vndertake my quarell, and yet I haue bene in the courtes of mightie kings, and other great Lordes. Now séeing the terme sette betwéene vs is more than halfe expired, for my laste refuge hether am I come to thy court to proue if heere my good fortune should be such that I should finde in it that which I haue so long <unclear>sued</unclear> for in other courts.

ended with sighes and sobs out of measure, thereby vttering the sorrow she had in hir heart, and the griefe for to loue such a knight, which moued great compassion in both <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and others of his companie. But there was no knight which woulde aunswere for the Princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name>, that was hir name, and yet there were many in the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> presence. Then in great pride and with a féerce looke this terrible <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> spake vnto hir. "What knight is there in the world so foole hardy and presumptious <name rend="roman">Radamira</name>, which for thy cause durst enter listes with me, yea, be it that both right nad iustice were right and cléere on his side, and art thou not quite deuoide of reason to leue vndon<unclear>e</unclear>, that which I beséech thée besides valewing thy beautie with my brauery, and thy pride with my puissance, I shall seeme to set to lowe a price on my selfe if I enioye thée, &amp; if ther be any knight here which will say y^e contrary, I wil soone make him recant his folly." <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> hauing said thus, knit his browes and made such a grimme countenaunce that all they feared him which behelde him, and ther was not a knight ther so hardy as to aunswere any thing in the Princesse <name rend="roman">Radamiras</name> behalfe, as if it had bene méere sinne in a gentlewoman straungers right, to hazard their person vpon a diuell rather than vpon an humaine creature. Euery man was still to the no little griefe of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> in that his court receiued such disgrace, but the gentleman of the Sunne sitting by and moued with compassion towards the gentlewoman, arose on his féete, and made aunswere to <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, saying. "Sir knight it is a great blasphemy to knighthoode, to say that in the whole world there is not a knight which dare fight with thée. Thy lye is loude, and thou doest against all reason enforce this princesse to marry thée. Be thou sure that if I were a knight I would suffer a thousande deathes rather then such reproach should be offered to a gentlewoman. For thy browne beautie is not fitte to be hir playfellowe," and saying thus hee set himselfe downe agayne. <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name><pb n="87" ed="digital" entity="13801:32" pages="44"/><milestone n="44     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
madde angry for these woordes, tourning towardes him, and rolling his eyes with greate rage, aunswered. "If thou wert as stronge as thou art foolishe, thou weake younlinge, I woulde make thy life and thy woordes ende at one time. But they say commonly, that women and those which are not able to weare armour, as priuiledged for their speach: and maye talke without controlment," and so <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> lefte him. But the couragious gentleman not béeinge able to beare that contumely, in his anger rose from where he sate, and comming to the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> knéeled before him beséeching his grace to graunte this, one suite, the firste which in his life time he had made. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> little thinckinge what he would aske, and louing him so well, that what thing he demaunded, it should haue ben graunted, willingly sayd, yea, and bad him say on what it was that he desired. The gentleman of the Sunne sayd, "my Lord, y^t which I require is, that you make me knight, bicause it is highe time that I receiue it. I doe not thincke my selfe so young as to put vp wrong at any mans hande." Those which were present,were much troubled at the request of the gentleman of the Sunne, foreséeing the ende which was to aunswere the bolde <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, &amp; the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> was greatly sorie to haue bene so rash in making promise before he had knowen his suite, wherefore he sate still without speaking, yea, or no, diuising onely, how to satisfie the young gentleman, and to quite himselfe of his promise. The gentleman of the Sunne douting least the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> woulde linger and delay the time very augerly sayd vnto him. "If I can not obteine this at your hands my Lord, I sweare by the high Gods that during my life I shall not bée mery, and I will goe serue some other Lorde which more liberally will consider of my requestes." The great <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> loth to disquiet the gentleman of the Sunne whome hée sawe attent vppon this matter, albeit <sic>is</sic> promise gréeued him much, aunswered him thus sayinge.
<pb n="88" ed="digital" entity="13801:33" pages="45"/><milestone n="[45L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
"Assuredly <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, if you had demaunded any other thing of me more profitable for your selfe, doubt you not but you had bene in possession of your desire by thys time, yea, had it bene the greatest part of my kingdome. But bicause I sée you are of tender years, &amp; that the time is not yet for you to support the burthen of armour, I would with you to refraine and let fall your suite for this time, or if you will not otherwise be perswaded, holde you, I yéeld vnto you, watch this night in your armour, and to morrowe at day breake I will giue you the order." The gentleman of the Sunne tooke him at y^e woord, &amp; very ioyfully kissed the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> hand for his gracious fauour. Then foō thence by soft paces, cōming to <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, he sayd vnto him. "Nowe y^t I haue license to parle with thée as a knight, I will aunswere thee <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, to the woordes which thou hast sayd vnto me, and so I tell thée that if the Princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name>, will put hir quarell into my handes, I will defend hir right, and take the battayle vpon mée, and be it that the Princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> dare not commit hir right vnto me, yet I say, that to be auenged on thy reprochfull speaches which thou hast blowed foorth, I willl fight with thée, and make thée to knowe that thou art more vniust and foolish, then valiant and courteous, as knightes ought to bée." The gentleman of the Sunne here ended, and the grimme s<unclear>i</unclear>er <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> began a laughter with these woordes. "In déede if all folly were force, many knights were couragious &amp; strong, for most of thē are to too vent<unclear>i</unclear>ons, and if thy selfe wert of as great habilitie as thou art of forwardnesse, the Princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> should ende hir quarell by to morrowe night, but thou deceiuest thy selfe, and albeit I am halfe ashamed to take the battaile against a knight neuer before acquainted with armour, yet biscause thou shalt not want due correction for thy follie, I accept the battaile which thou offerest, as well for the one cause as for the other." As this talke was at the hottest betwéene them, the princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name><pb n="89" ed="digital" entity="13801:33" pages="45"/><milestone n="45     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
behelde the gentleman of the Sunne very earnestly, noting as well his yeares as his person, and albeit he was then beardlesse. Yet she thus conceiued of him that he was of noble courage, and very stronge, and besides this ther appeared in his face somewhat which she iudged more than manlike. And as she was wise, so hir heart gaue hir that this younge gentleman had some diuine bloude in him which she thought to haue discended from some of hir false Gods. So neither lightly nor wantonly mouing but with great discreation and wisedome standing in y^e same place, &amp; musing what she ought to do in y^e ende, no other knight answering y^e challenge for hir, not altogether out of hope, shee agreede to put hir quarrell into his handes by deliberate counsayle, concluding, if hee were murthered hir selfe to followe after, and so she spake to the Gyant on this wise. "<name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> sithe this gentleman with so good will profereth himselfe to maintaine my right against thée, I am very well content to put my quarrell into his handes, and from this time foorth I will not séeke other knight." The beautiful princesse <name rend="roman">Radimira</name> doing thus, the fierce <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> was sore moued to sée that she made so little account of him, and so much trusted the boldenes of the young gentleman, and foming at the mouth lyke a wylde boare he was not able to speake one word for the fury and choller which boyled in him. The gentleman of the Sunne thancked hir goodly for the acceptation of his paines in hir name. In this manner the battell was put off till the next day, but the gentleman of the Sunne was not so glad, to haue occasion offered to be made knight, as the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and his friends were sorrowefull, to haue him fall into this daunger, which they imagined to be to too sure, bicause of the strength of <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, and the youth of the gentleman of the Sunne. They thought it a desperate case for him to wage this battayle, with the sauegarde of his honour. Then the young gentleman <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> being of more
<pb n="90" ed="digital" entity="13801:34" pages="46"/><milestone n="[46L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
yeares then <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> was, repended that hée had not aunswered for the Princesse, both bicause he thought it a blemish in his honour to haue excused himselfe from such a matter, and his age was more then <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febos</name> was, and so might better acquite himselfe against the force of <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, &amp; especially fearing the perill of his friende, he would néedes haue taken the battayle out of his hands, but perceiuing the vnwillingnesse of the gentleman of the Sunne he would speake no more in it. At sunne set <name rend="roman">Florion</name> came from hunting, and hearing of the battayle which was appoynted he was very sad for <name rend="roman">Donzel de Febos</name> sake, bicause of <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> force, and <name rend="roman">Donzels</name> weakenesse, and so he tooke vpon him to perswade <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> to giue ouer the battayle, and put it vppon some other in his right if it so pleased him. But <name rend="roman">Florion</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> wer both beguyled in <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, albeit either of thē wer such knights as if y^e one hath ben rehersed &amp; of y^e other shalbe shwered you hereafter. <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> was strōg as his lyke scarcely among y^e <name rend="roman">Pagans</name>, &amp; it might be it woulde ill haue proued with them two, as a man would haue sworne it only by y^e tenour of <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> countenaunce, no man beholding him but wyth the same good wyll which they beare vnto the Diuill. And if <name rend="roman">Florion</name> and <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> desired this battayle it is to be thought it sprang of theire loue towardes <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> rather then of auy comforte theire courage gaue them to winne honour in the battayle. But the day was spente, and things necessary for the battayle were in prouiding. At night <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> the wise comming from the red Iland, tooke landing at <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> and méeting with the gentleman of the Sunne he told him y^t many daies had passed since he knew of the conflicte betwene <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> and him and therefore had brought certeine armour for him, and so he commaunded his squiers to vntie their two packets, out of one packet <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> tooke a white armour wrought with beames of golde descending from his hel-

mette, wherein was grauen a face so faire and shéene, that it shedded out beames as the Sunne, and scarcely for the brightnesse might a man beholde it, and out of the same he tooke out a sworde all garnished with golde and embossed with precious stone, y^e pomell, scabard &amp; chape being so rich and curious, that none there was which praysed not the workemanship. Out of the other packet he drewe out an other white armour pounced with <name rend="roman">Floure de Luces</name> of golde, and an other swoorde, both which he gaue to <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, bestowing the other vpon <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>. With these good armours the two gentlemen were well apayde, especially the gentleman of the Sunne, whih more estemed of this gifte then of al the segnioryes of the earth: And so he continued his charge for the morrowe battayle, very confident on his owne parte, but to the no little dismaye of his friends, chiefly of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name> which woulde not hys destruction for all hir fathers landes. The Princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name>, in the meane time not fully settled in hir thought droue out y^t night neither merely nor dumpishly, but very heauily as abhoaring nothing so much as y^e company of <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>.

Oh how doth Fortune enuie my felicitie in prolonging the time thus that I cannot so soone as I wold dispath this wretched knight saying this and somewhat els the trumpetts stayed, and with great rage he ranne towardes the Knighte of the Sunne, but the knighte bearing his shéelde before him, with his speare in his hande met <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> with all his force, with the violence of this course, the grounde shooke vnder their horses, and this first iouney brast their great speares into small shiuers. <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> with the strong encounntry of the Knight of the Sunne, doubled and fell ouer the arson of the saddle, his horse carying him out of the prease, to blush without company for neuer in his life time had he receiued the lyke blowe.

By this time neither of these knights were well pleased with the other, and they let dryue so each at other that in shorte space they made plain their singuler māhoods, &amp; they which sawe it iudged it to be the brauest battayle which they had euer séene betéene two knights. The valiant knights with malicious eies sorrowing each at others welfare, bicause their armour was so good that no swoord would enter, were much more woode laying about thē without order, and caring not where they hit, so they might sée the bloud spin as fast as the sparcles encreased.</p><p>It was now halfe an houre since the battaile began, and <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> well féeling the courage of the knight of y^e Sun, in that he had gotten none aduauntage ouer him in all y^e time.

But as I tolde you <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> séeing his aduersary so valiantly beare himselfe against him, and not being able to gouerne his ill will he lifte him selfe vp in his stirops and lent the knight of the Sunne a blowe with all his force, that although he could not cut his fine helmette, yet he made him bowe his head to his horsenecke, being blynded with the continuall sparkes of fire which came out of his headpéece. The worthy knight of the Sunne comming agayne to himselfe and sitting surer in this saddle, retourned the lyke blowe to <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, so that <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> lost his memorie and receiued an other blowe on his bulke agaynst the saddle bowe, which made the bloud gushe out of his mouth and nostrells, and the Knight of the Sunne followed him to haue vnhorsed him. But <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> recouered, and ere the knight of the Sunne coulde hit him, he gaue him on the lefte shoulder a mightie blowe, that with the weight thereof he had falne to the grounde but for the embracing of his horse necke. Againe <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> repayed him with a <foreign lang="la" rend="roman">plus vltra</foreign>, the surplusage more then an ordinary interest, and they wounded each other mangling them selues pitifully, &amp; the clashing of their armour was so great, that it rang lyke bells in all the citie.</p><p>This was the second houre of the fight, and the mach was equall not being knowne who had the better hand. <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> not greatly pawsing, but in his anger reuiling his gods sayd vnto himselfe.

But seing this is the issue that if I lose the day, I must loose <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> also, let him winne hir and weare hir, for be he what he may be, he shall get no honour at my hands," and so saying, he stroke his aduersary so sore on the brest, that he brused his curasse and put him in great daunger. <name rend="roman">Cheualiero del Febo</name> not a little abashed at the great force of <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> this being the first battayle that eyer he had fought, thought in himselfe that if all the knights in the worlde were lyke him he should get but small prayse, and therefore to embolden his courage he rating himselfe on thys wise. "Am I he of whome the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> hath forefold so much? am I he without whom y^e <name rend="roman">Babilonians</name> dare not set foote into <name rend="roman">Persia</name>? am I he for whome they haue thus long time wayted?

Had it not bene better for my credit not to haue bene borne with so great fame as the <name rend="roman">Astrologers</name> haue forshewed, then in so short a time so much to be troubled. O <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> of <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> and you others which are Judges of the fielde, are you not ashamed of me that in my first battayle, and the first fruites of my knighthoode, I am at the poynt to become recreaunt. But recreaunt I wyl neuer be," and so as it were blowing the coales of his anger, when he was on a light fire he set <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> in such a heat, with his thicke and mightie strokes, that the vnlacing of his helme and the v<unclear>mn</unclear>aylig of his armour could scare giue him breath inough. <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> then thought that his enemyes strength encreased, yet not altogether fowndered, he aunswered him as well as he coulde, that the battayle séemed to be more fierce at that time than at the

beginning. The houre clock hath smitten three, since they entered the listes, all much meruailing how they were able to endure so long. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> said to <name rend="roman">Florion</name> &amp; to y^e wise man which sate by, "certeinly if I had not séene with w^t my eyes, I should hardly haue beléeued y^t a knight of so young yeares, as this knight of the Sunne is, might haue had the force so to endaunger a worthy knight, for you knowe howe y^e houres are passed since they began y^e combate, and how yet he abideth many blowes, &amp; still séemes as fresh as he was whē he first came foorth. The wiseman aunswered, yea my Lord, but if you knew with whom he doth fight, you might with more reason meruaile at it. For <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> is one of the strongest &amp; worthyest knights that is among the <name rend="roman">Pagans</name>, and his pride is so great y^t he alone would not refuse to ioyne with an C. knights, and would well thincke to haue the mastery of them all, before hée would be taken." Thus the bench was not idle, &amp; the princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> very busely attended vpon hir knight, and watched euery tourne, more then halfe ioyfully, speaking thus vnto the Princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name> standing by. "I beléee for a certeintie Princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name>, that our high Gods now at length cloied with my mishaps, haue prouided this knight for me, for in respect of his beautie &amp; great bountie he séemeth rather heauenly then terrestriall. Yea, so I thincke, then aunswered the Princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name>, and that not onely for your succour, but to ayde me and my cause y^e gods haue sent him hether, for by him I looke to be Quéene of <name rend="roman">Persia</name>.

one misconstruing the euent. For <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> séeing that the longer the battaile lasted, the farther he was from y^e victory, with all the force he might, he stroke the knight of the Sunne such a blowe on the helmet that his sences were bereft him, &amp; had he not taken holde of the saddle bow, he had kissed the ground. So the fray was renued, but the knight of y^e Sunne gaue <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> an other blow as strong which bewitched his vnderstanding, for his horse carried him about the field, tossing him on the pomell of his saddle as if he had bene dead. The knight of y^e Sunne thinking it no glory to smite a man halfe beade, pursued him not, but <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> reuiuing his face all bloudie, with both his handes, hit the knight of the Sunne vpon the headpéee, that if the helme had not bene the surer, it had riuen him to the belly, but the stroke amased him, &amp; the goare bloud ranne out of his mouth and nostrels, and his horse féeling part of the great blowe carried his master form thence, the good knight lying vpon the crouper of his horse in an extasie as if he had bene quite dead. <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> hasted to haue giuen him an other blowe, those which sawe it were very sad, but none were euer so wofully begon, as was the princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> who with great griefe tourning hir selfe from that sight, and fel on wéeping bitterly. But <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> had not followed him iiij. paces with his horse, when the good knight start vp, and féeling his face wet with bloud, in great fury spurred his horse, and met <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> with such a blowe, y^t the fine helmet could not denie him passage, but that he cloue <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> head in sunder. Heere y^e shute of y^e <sic>peole</sic> &amp; the princes <name rend="roman">Baliseas</name> calling hir awaked the princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> as it had ben out of a sound sléepe, and little looking for so good newes: and the good knight, (<name rend="roman">Raiartes</name> béeing dead) put vp his swoord into the sheth, and demaunded of the iudges if ther were ought else to do to make the Princesse frée. The Princesse hearde this gladly, and the iudges aunswered hym noe, for that suffised which hée had done. Then with

Then y^e princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name> came &amp; the princesse <name rend="roman">Radamira</name> dooinge hir duetie to the knight of the Sunne, and as not able else to requite the curtesie he had shewen hir, shée offered to him both hir landes and hir person the better to serue him. Thus they tooke their rest many dayes, and the good knight was much honoured of them all. And there was a great feast made, and diuers iustes and turneys there proclaymed, for the dubbing of <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> and other gentlemen knightes. At this feast, the Prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> behaued him best, so that all men iudged him to bée a valiant knight.

Now the story retourneth to the same <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, and saith, that when he had appeased the people and brought these two kingdomes in quiet subiection, (as this is an imbecilitie of mans nature, euer coueting to amplifie and enlarge our possessions) so this stoute and proud <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> not content with that which he had already got by disorder and rapine, he aduentured yet farther to winne <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, with all the kingdomes of the <name rend="roman">Assirians</name> bordering in those parts, reckening himselfe already in possession of them, for the power of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> was in sufficient to repulse his forces, hoping moreouer to ad his dominions, all those countries lying in the coast of the middle earth sea. For this cause he assembled his power as well <name rend="roman">Medians</name>, as other his subiects. Hauing this great army in a readinesse, yet trusting more in his owne person then in all his people, he tooke the way toward <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, minding not to stay till he came néere <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>. This was some dayes after the combat which the knight had with <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>. And as it fell out, it was at the same time as the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and y^e Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> were deuising of y^e order which they should take for the recouer the kingdome of <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, that the newes came how the puissant <name rend="roman">Africano</name> was on his way with a huge army toward <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, for which cause they were cast into double doubts, seeing that the enimy whom they purposed to finde abroad, came to séeke them at their owne doores. Well with greate care and diligence they began to prepare all things necessarie for the welcomminge of such a ghest, by gatheringe his people out of all partes of the kingdome, raysinge the walles hygher, and fortifyinge the towers once builded by <name rend="roman">Semiramis</name>, all whiche woulde little haue

But thus the <name rend="roman">Assirians</name> were almost at their wittes ende, not knowing howe to repell him, for the bruite of his fame was greatly noysed. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> of <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> well experimented in warfare, commaunded all whiche could beare armour to come to <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> that his forces béeing vnited, heée might bée of greater power agayst his enimies, <name rend="roman">Africano</name> stayed not till hee came to the very walls of <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, where he gladly beheld the citie, biscause of the fame it had to be so great &amp; so well peopled, he highly commended of the sumptuous edifices &amp; high wals enclosing it, which enflamed his desire to the Lord of it. Presently he made to pitch his tends in a large field, enuironing the wals as farre as he might, for it as impossible to compasse them round about with two of <name rend="roman">Xerxes</name> armies, he had in his camp .20000. knights, &amp; .30000. horsemen, &amp; two strong giants beside, the one of them called <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name>, &amp; the other <name rend="roman">Dardario</name> through whose force hee thought to haue ouercome the <name rend="roman">Assirians</name>.

The letter was read, and they all said that in great pride the <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> had so written, but bicause prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> &amp; the most part of those which were there, knew the strength and power of <name rend="roman">Africano</name> in y^e battailes forepassed, they would not make answere nor speak a word vntil they had heard y^e <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> minde. Beeing in this order all hushed, the knight of the Sunne rose vp, and demaunded lisence of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> to giue answere to the messenger. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> graunted it him, then the knight of the Sunne aduauncing his voice that it might be heard spake to the messenger thus. "Retourne to thy Lord, for it is now to late to aunswere his letters, but in y^e morning my Lord shall call his counsel &amp; shal send thy Lord an answere by one of his knights, to whō he must giue credit in this behalfe."

Therfore he determined in few daies to destroy y^e great citie, burning &amp; wasting all, for al that, that he wished rather to haue bene owner of it by exchaunge or couenant then by rasing and battering the walles which were so goodly. The messenger auoiding the pallaice, y^e knight of the Sunne directed his speach to the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> in this wise.

The gyant hauing his charge, delayed no time, but hastely arming himselfe with fine stéele, he tooke a strong speare in his hand, and rode toward the knight of the Sunne, who in the mydst way abode his comming very glad, when he sawe so greated

a Gyaunt come against him, as desirous to purchase honour vpon his lykenesse. But the Guant sayd vnto hym. What art thou knight so bolde and venturous, that hast in such wise disturbed our campe, wyth the noyse of thy horne. The Knight of the Sunne replyed. I am a knight of y^e <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> which come to the king <name rend="roman">Africano</name> to make him answer to the letter by him sent vnto the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>. Now returne you backe and tell him, I am here to doe my message, and if he will heare it bidde him come armed and well horsed for otherwise I will not make him answere. The Gyant very scornfully tooke vp a great laughter, and giuing the knight a little sowce on the helmette with his gauntlet he sayd vnto him. "Now I tell thée, that that thou arte the maddest knight in the worlde to challenge him to battayle, at the only <sic>heariug</sic> of whose name the greatest part of al <name rend="roman">Asia</name> doth tremble, and if thou wert not a simple foole thou wouldest not in such sort discouer thine impotencie. If thou hast any message to the kynge <name rend="roman">Africano</name> from the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> come with me and thou shalt be brought to his presence, for he is not such a one as to come into the fielde agaynst one sely knight. The kynge <name rend="roman">Africano</name> himselfe must hear my message sayd the Knight of the Sunne and he must heare it armed, for otherwise I will not open it." The strong <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name> was angrye at the knights wordes and thincking him to be but as other knights were or amongst the meanest he offered to haue set the knight beside the saddle and so to haue drawne him perforce to y^e king, shewing herein to less pride &amp; disdain then the gréedy Fawlcon doth in the pursute of the simple Pigeon to carry it to the ayre among the young ones. But his lotte was farre otherwise, for the knight perceuing his entent tourned the poynt of his spere and strake him so strongly on the chest, that though his armour was good it entred and lyttle and left him windlesse for a time. <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name> thought himselfe now not well at ease, and therefore retourning to himselfe, he neuer studyed at

the courtesie of the kinght in sparing him in his traunce, but taking one part of the field and broching his horse with the spurs, his speare being in the reste with deadly rage he ranne against the knight of the Sunne, who was nothing slow in the receipt. Their shocks were such in their méeting that the heauy speare of the strong <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name> brake into shyuers in y^e fine helmet of the Knight of the Sun, not diseasing him. But the knight of the Sunne hit the Gyant with such dext<unclear>e</unclear>ritie that he ouerthrew him and the great wayght of his body made the Gyant weare his necke on the to side lyke a fidler, which was no little payne vnto him. Yet he gate vpon his féete rising with much a doe. "Then the Knight of the Sunne finding him vprisen bad him defend himselfe. The Gyant aunswered that he could not, therefore doe with me what you will. The knight of the Sunne sayd. No, but retourne to the kinge <name rend="roman">Africano</name> thy Lorde and tell him that a knight of the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> doth awayte him here to make aunswere vnto his letter, and if so be he be minded to heare it, will him in his armour to come foorth, for in no other order will I vtter it." The Gyant answered he would doe it, and not being able to sit on horsebacke, he was compelled to go on foote through the campe, driuing in his thought the remembraunce of the knights prowesse, so that hee was perswaded that not twentie knights <name rend="roman">Assyrians</name> could haue done him so much harme as this one knighte had done. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> with the Princes <name rend="roman">Florion</name> and <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> wer no lesse amazed in their cōtemplation to beholde the euent of the first welcome, and they gaue great thanckes to their gods for sending them so good a knight. <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name> came before the king <name rend="roman">Africano</name> his Lorde, and without fayling in any part declared to him that which had chaunced with the knight, and the message which was sent by him, moreouer telling the king that he thoughte that knight to be the strongest knight in the worlde, for that with these two blowes which he had giuen him, hee

had throwen him to the grounde, and might haue killed him.</p><p>The king <name rend="roman">Africano</name> not a lyttle sory to sée y^e strōg <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name> so ill entreated and abashed at the force of one only knight, would therevpon haue put on his armour to haue bene auenged on the knight and to heare his message. But the other Gyaunt then in presence called <name rend="roman">Dardario</name>, and much about <name rend="roman">Herbyons</name> pitch, being of no lesse value then the first, in his choller menacing the knight, swore a great othe that he would bring the knight bound hand and foote vnto the king, wherfore taking a great horse be passed through the campe and aproching néere the Knight of the Sunne, he would not salute y^e knight, but as his anger was throughly kindled, with a great spere as big almost as a Pyne trée, he prepared himselfe for the carier. And the worthye <name rend="roman">Greeke</name> knowing the Gyauntes errande dyd the lyke and spurring his horse he came vnto the close. The great speare of the Gyant was thought to haue perced the harnesse of the knight, by reason of the few shyuers that it made, but it did not so, and contrarywise the knights speare couched with great dexteritie entered through the body of the great <name rend="roman">Dardario</name> a great parte of the staffe appearing at the shoulders.</p><p>By this meanes the monstrous Gyant fell dead from his horse with such a grone as the tall <name rend="roman">Cedars</name> of <name rend="roman">Libanus</name> make, being rent vp by the roote. The <name rend="roman">Babilonians</name> reioyced excedingly at this: but <name rend="roman">Africano</name> was all enflamed wyth choller to sée his Gyaunt slayne wyth one onely blowe and knowing that to himselfe alone this base was bidde in great rage rose from the seate where hee sate, without speaking a word, &amp; entring into his tent armed himselfe with sure armoure, and chose him a very strong speare, not tarying for squyre or page to helpe him.</p><p>In this anger he was so terrible that none of his people durste come néere him, and so with a most fierce and cruell coūtenance he armed himselfe. So soone as y^e <name rend="roman">Pagan</name><pb n="108" ed="digital" entity="13801:41" pages="55"/><milestone n="[55L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
had buckeled on his armour, immediately ther was brought him a horse such a one as could haue carried tenne armed knights, as I thinke the same bredth whereof the horse of <name rend="roman">Troy</name> was. The trappings of the horse aswell golde as the stirops and all his armour set with precious stones, that he might wyll séeme a great Lord which was mayster of such armory, but this was the straungest sight that <name rend="roman">Africano</name> set vpon so mighty a horse made him nowithstanding to bow &amp; double vnder him. But to go forward <name rend="roman">Africano</name> taking the greatest speare which might be had, rose with a <sic>f</sic>ofte pace towards the Knight of the Sunne. The Knight of the Sunne saw him come from amongst his people and thought presently that he was the kynge <name rend="roman">Africano</name> aswell for his rich armour, and his horse so curiously barbed, and the talnesse of his personage which he very well noted to be not farre dissonant from the common report: so he beséeched his gods from his heart to be fauourable vnto him agaynst so strong a Gyant. <name rend="roman">Africano</name> well viewed the knight of the sunne his stature and making, and vpon these premisses inferred thus much, that well might he be a man of much force which so well shewed in his exteriour countenaunce, and much more in his de<sic>ē</sic>des and valour. But comming néerer vnto y^e knight as his custome was little to regarde the whole worlde, so with a proud &amp; disdaynfull voyce, he spake vnto y^e knight. "Thou miserable &amp; wretched knight, thou sayst thou art a messenger &amp; bringest a message vnto me, thou hast slayne the Gyant <name rend="roman">Dardario</name> and almost y^e strong <name rend="roman">Herbyon</name>, which two had ben sufficient to haue bet downe y^e walles of <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, I swear vnto thée by my gods y^t if al y^e world were giuen me for thy rāsome thou shouldst not escape y^e death. The Knight of the Sunne embasing his voyce mildelye aunswered. If I haue had to doe with thy Gyants <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, they were occasioners of it themselues, for I came not hether to other purpose but to make the aunswere in the behalfe of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, and if I came onely to séeke
<pb n="109" ed="digital" entity="13801:41" pages="55"/><milestone n="55     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
thée thou oughtst to haue bene first which should haue presented himselfe to mée, and to haue heard what I would haue sayd, and to haue heard mee as a messenger, and not to attempt my death as a knowen enemy. Now that thou art come <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, I tell thee why I am come, heare it if thou wilt. The gods which haue preserued me from thy Gyants haue reserued me to fight with thée. But listen on &amp;c." Here the rage of the <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> stopped the course of his talke, and the mightie <name rend="roman">Africano</name> smiting his hande on his thighe for anger lifte vppe his other hande also to haue buffeted y^e knight, but a better minde ouertooke him that he thought it reason to heare the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> aunswere before he should <sic>condepmne</sic> the messenger, and so staying, he bad him tell on quickly, for I will well punish thy offence whatsomeuer aunswere the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> sendeth mee. The Knight of the Sunne wishing the battayle with all his heart said. "Then know thou <name rend="roman">Africano</name> that thy letter being receiued and reade in the presence of my Lorde the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, after consultacion had, my Lord sendeth thée this aunswer by me. Albeit before this time thou art notori<unclear>ous</unclear>ly defamed for a tyrant in y^t thou hast falsely &amp; fraudulētly enchroched vp many kingdoms, yet he <sic>u</sic>euer thought thou wouldest haue enterprysed the vsurpation of the most sacred <name rend="roman">Assyrian</name> Empyre, an Empyre consecrated to the gods, and claymed by them as their right, and in their righte gouerned by my Lordes auncestours and Liefetenaunts to the gods and their Feefarmers, and therefore though preaduenture the open wrongs done vnto men, the gods doe often pardon and winke at, yet seldome leaue they vnreuenged the iniuries offered to themselues, and as it is to be thought so manifest a contempt of their deuine power shall not escape them. Besides for the citie of <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, he letteth thee to vnderstande that thy selfe art not ignoraunt that it is his and that he hath right to it as heire to the king <name rend="roman">Orixeres</name> his father on that part of his <unclear>liue</unclear>loode, and that thou hast no title nor colourable shewe

to demaund it. Wherefore if it be so y^t thou wilt take it against all reason from him, hée telleth thée that he can no lesse doe then defend it from thée &amp; the whole world, for hauing right and iustice on his side, hée little feareth the inuasion of man," deliuering his message in this forme of woords, the knight of the Sunne sayde. This is the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> aunswere, and pausing a while, he began againe thus. "And I, <name rend="roman">Africano</name> craued of my Lord to be the messenger, for I would thou shouldst know how daūgerously thou offendest the diuine Gods in entering vpon y^e kingdome of <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, and disenheriting the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, the legitimate and onely Lord of that kingdome. Now therfore thou shouldest well doe, to surrender thy claime into his hands, and contente thée with the reuenues already receiued, &amp; the iniust deteining of his right so long time. If thou wylt doe this not for my sake, but for the high gods agaynst whom thou hast hainously trespassed, thereby thou shalt pacifie the Gods and leese the name of a tyrant, so odious and so detested amongest men. If thou wylt styll perseuer in this thy tyrannicall obstinacy, I vtterly defie thée to y^e death, and certifie thée y^t either I wil slay a tyrant, or vpon a tyrant I will be slaine." Whilest the knight of y^e Sunne amplified at large vpon this point. <name rend="roman">Africano</name> albeit very angry, yet marked him from top to toe, waying with what confidency he had discharged his charge, sometimes quietly admonishing to amend, &amp; otherwise threatening &amp; defying with a fierce semblaunce. But as he cared neither for God nor man, so he swallowed vp y^e knights woords, reputing the knight for a foole, for he thought his name only to able to afraye any knight, thus he replied. "Wer thy hands foolish knight as good to fight, as thy tongue is fine in preaching, I would not meruaile though thou hadst y^e hardines to defame <name rend="roman">Africano</name>. But I wil curtail thy copie w^t this currish answer. Prepare thee to y^e battaile, &amp; take this promise at my hand, y^t if I be ouercome, I wil leue to <name rend="roman">Florion</name> not onely y^e king-

dome of <name rend="roman">Persia</name> but also all that which I my selfe haue of possessions in <name rend="roman">Asia</name>, &amp; so saying <name rend="roman">Africano</name> made against the knight, but the Knight of the Sunne wisely to order his affayres aunswered him saying. Stay a little <name rend="roman">Africano</name> and heare that which I say. Thou knowest that already this day I haue twise fought with two of thy Gyants, and am foreweried, if now I fight with thée and thou subdue me, what honour shalt thou get thereby? will not men say that thou tokest me at the aduantage, when I was hurt before or weryed as I am? Appoynt that our combat be to morrow, and that assurance be had of this condicion on either parts, &amp; say thou the same before the principall of thy army, that if perhaps I should slay thée in this battayle, y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> should not néede to haue a newe skirmish with thy people." This deuise of the knight was sore against <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> minde, for he would willingly haue purged some parte of the choller which he brought with him boiling in his stomack: but seing this auoidance could not be at this time made with the warrantie of his honour, he graunted to the condicions, and thus aunswered him. Let it be so as thou sayst, foolish knight, I wil do thée a pleasure in delaying y^e time of reuenge of my knights and they foolish woords, but sith I may not refraine my anger hauing thée before me, retourne hastely to y^e citie and I will to my tent, &amp; with this he tourned y^e raynes of his horse &amp; came to his pauilion wher he fed vpon melancholy all the day, not speaking to any one. The Knight of y^e Sun deffered y^e battaile till y^e next day, not for y^t he was wery, but to aduertise y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> of y^t which was agreed vpon, now y^e rather to assure himselfe retourned to y^e citie, wher he was receiued w^t grat ioy &amp; pleasure of all his friends, &amp; being within y^e pallaice he told y^e <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> to what issue he had brought y^e matter, he was very ioyfull by reson of y^e wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgādeos</name> prophecies which he hoped thē to be accōplished, &amp; partly doubtful of y^e succes, biscause prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> knew <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> strēgth was such as few wer able to

resist it, he would haue had him not to deale in this aduenture alone, and requested him to ioyne vnto him some other companiōs, namely Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, which themselues laboured greatly, but hee gaue them thanckes and excused himselfe with this that it was so decreed, but sayth he ther may be a time wherin you may employ your forces. For he knew the people of <name rend="roman">Africano</name> to be so hardy that it perchaunce their Lorde shoulde be slayne or be in daunger, they would either succour theire Lord, or worke his reuenge vpon the conquerour. Therfore he willed them to bee in a readinesse. So these two knights gladly accepted that charge, and all that day chose out of the people, those which should the next day keepe the fielde with them to be at hande for succours to the knight if any treason should be compassed agaynst hym. The Knight of the Sunne tooke his reste merely till the day wherein he prospered as you shall now heare.</p></div><div id="mirrour026" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ A cruell battayle betweene the Knight of the Sunne and Africano, with the dis<unclear>comfriture</unclear> of Africanos hoaste.

from farre countries, the stuffe whereof it was made, for it was no common mettall. This helmet was for workemanship so excéeding, as for it onely <name rend="roman">Lirgandeo</name> wan hys spurres, and was commended aboue all the learnedst and wisest Magicians, for none other hauing not attained to the lyke perfection in Astronomy or Arte Magicke coulde haue euer made it. Nowe as I sayde comming into the chamber, where the knight of the Sunne, the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>, and the rest were, and shewing his helmet, hée droue them all into a wonder at the beautie and richesse of the helmet, for although they knewe not the hidden vertue of it, yet for the brauerie of the stones they iudged i<unclear>t</unclear> valuable with a kings delight. He bare in it a féeld Azour of the liknesse of the element in most quiet and peaceable manner, not troubled with winde or cloudes, in the chiefe there was a Sunne guilded spreading his beames al ouer the helmet, as it were the mantling, somwhat besides good armory I thincke, but well fitting for so gorgious a péece of armour. The Sunne shined so bright, that it almoste dazeled the eyes of the beholders. This helmet christening him now by the name of the knight of the Sunne, as the Sunne in his left side named him, the gentleman of the Sunne when he was first founde in the Sea by <name rend="roman">Florion</name>. The wise man came vnto the knight and tooke from him the helmet which he had already laced on, &amp; put this other, saying, My Lorde you goe to fight with one so strong and valiant a knight, that neither may I report it for the straungenesse, neyther can you giue credit vnlesse you haue tryall, nowe though the helmette you haue is very good, yet béeing hacked and brused with the terrible blowes of stronge <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>, it is not suche a one as maye resist the weightie strokes of <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, but this which now I giue you, make much of it, for I knowinge that this battayle ought to bée foughten by you in the right of my nephewe the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, haue this xx. yeares and more busied my selfe aboute it, and ful-

ly finished it, not past a yeare since. The knight of the Sunne triumphed nowe to be made the master of so rare an helmet, and in so néedfull a time, saying to <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> in thanckfull wise, that he accepted better of that helmet then of the whole worlde, if it were giuen hym. "You doe not amisse in so dooing, aunswered the wyse man, for I tell you the time will come when you shall make exchaunge of it vnto a knight straunger farre borne out of these countryes, and I doe not meruaile thoughe you shall then make merchaundise of the headpéece which nowe you so highly regarde, for at that time you shall sell the most precious thinge that euer you had, for a worse thing which shall bringe you to the ieopardy of death a M. times, and neither shall wit nor might, cunning nor courage helpe you to auoyde this chaunce." The knight of the Sunne stood looked vopon y^e wise man, as not witting to what ende those woordes tended, and studying a long time, he thus gainsayed it. "Of things to come, I haue naught to say, but to referre suche thinges to the prouidence of our Gods, but of thinges which are already come, thus much I saye, that I knowe nothinge in the world for which I woulde lose this helmette gyuen mée in so good oportunitie." But the morning béeing farre spent they left off for that time, and departed all from the pallaice towards the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> army, &amp; setting their people in order, they passed out of y^e gates with all things prepared for to kéepe the field.

the resalutation in this manner. Thou oughtest to haue come earlyer into the feelde, to the ende our battayle might haue bene sooner dispatched, but tell me nowe quickly the articles of the agréement to bée made, and spende no more time least we take an other daye of respite. Naye there is no more to doe, aunswered the knight of the Sunne, but that of thy parte, two of thy knightes bée iudges, and for my part these two knightes, <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name>, and his vnckle héere present shall sit with them, before them take an othe for the performaunce of that whereoff thou madest mee promise béeing alone with thee. I am well contented with this sayd <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, and now I sweare the same, that if I bée either slayne, or yelden the kingdome of <name rend="roman">Persia</name> shall be redeliuered to <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, &amp; this I commaund my knights to sée auouched. So soone as hee had sayde this hée gaue backe, and the knight of the Sunne did the like, the iudges<unclear>,</unclear> assigning a place for the combatte<unclear>,</unclear> Nowe are the two couragiousest knightes of the worlde lefts the one agaynst the other with so fierce and ma<unclear>nl</unclear>y countenaunces that it might haue dismayed the spectators. When the sounde of the trumpette had sommoned them to the battayle, the two stronge knyghtes gyrdinge theyr horses with their spurres, rode the one agaynst the other, with such vyolence as if the cloudes had rente a sunder by the outbrasting of the thunderbolte. Their great speares broken vpon their armour flew in small shyuers, and they rode one by the other as quietly as if no shocke had bene made. <name rend="roman">Africano</name> the <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> not acquainted with such encountries, and alwaies wont to vnhorse all knyghts whome hée mette seeing the knight prepared for y^e second iourney meruailed much who this strong warriour might be, whom before this time he had not proued, nor yet euer heard off. But lightly casting these thinges in his minde, as at a sodeine he drew out his sword &amp; tourned towardes his enemy which was then ready for him.

They <unclear>strake</unclear> each other such heauie blowes that warding them on their sheeldes, although they were of pure steele, yet they cleaued them in the middest, and their swoordes lighted on their helmettes driuing out great sparcles of fire before them. The great <name rend="roman">Africano</name> gaue the knight of the Sunne vppon his helmette such buffettes and with such force that euery man would haue iudged it had ryuen the headpeece. There is the cunninge of the wyse <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> wel appeared, for it was not possible for yron, steele, or Adamant stone, but to haue yelded to that stroke. But what thincke you: y^t the knyght of the Sunne did, when he thought that he had cleane lost his hearing by it, and sayde to himselfe, that not without good cause <name rend="roman">Africano</name> was greatly feared amonge the <name rend="roman">Pagans</name>? Nay, to the no lesse meruaile of both hoastes, the knight of the Sunne let driue at <name rend="roman">Africano</name> with such force as it was to the no small admiration of all men that he hewed him not in péeces. But you must learne that when <name rend="roman">Africano</name> passed by sea from <name rend="roman">Afrike</name> into <name rend="roman">Asia</name>, it was his chaunce to saile by <name rend="roman">Lemnos</name> where <name rend="roman">Vulcans</name> forge was. There he heard of <name rend="roman">Vulcans</name> caue where his storehouse was, and enteringe into it he achieued straunge thinges, not here to be recounted, and gayned <name rend="roman">Vulcans</name> armour wrought with his owne handes, the best in all the land. This when <name rend="roman">Africano</name> tryed often times to be very good, whereoff he was well pleased, from that time foorth he neuer fought with other but with that. Nowe albeit this headpéece was well framed from béeing cut, yet the knight of the Sunnes blowes were so heauy y^t oftentimes <name rend="roman">Africano</name> wist not where he was, &amp; recouering would say vnto himselfe. What is this? I beléeue the strength of the whole world conspireth with this knight against me, &amp; if it be not so that he is of the offprigs of our Gods, yet am I sure y^t he is no man. But among all the great blowes which y^e knight of the Sunne lent to <name rend="roman">Africano</name> there was one at the fore end of the battayle vppon y^e top of <name rend="roman">Afri-</name><pb n="117" ed="digital" entity="13801:44" pages="59"/><milestone n="59     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><name rend="roman">canos</name> helmette, the swoorde not enteringe but slidinge downe vpon his shoulders with suche force that it made him leane all his body vpon the horseneck, whereoff if he had not taken hold he had fallen to the ground. Then the <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> sure enough yet in his saddell and his force redoubling as his anger encreased smote at the inchaunted helmet that he made the knight confesse in his thought, that his helmet was his good borrow. The blow sounded throughout all the féelde, as if it had bene a bell, and the knight of the Sunne with the weight of the blowe, neither boult vpright nor full declining, but staying vpon the arson drouped as halfe dead. But the bloud gushing out of his nose fetched him againe quickely ere that <name rend="roman">Africano</name> could come within him. Nowe séeing it time to defend himselfe from his aduersary, he stoode vpright in his stirops, and with both his handes strake at <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, so y^t if the workman had not bene more to blame, the blowes had made peace betwéene them, but for all the workmans craft, the weight of the blowe brased the helmet whiche was the cause of <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> spéedier death. <name rend="roman">Africano</name> benummed of his sences, the bloude strayning though the ioyntes of the helmet and he sitting in his saddle as halfe dead. The horse sore daunted with the blowe, stoode styll till <name rend="roman">Africano</name> reuiued, and in the gathering of his strength outbrayed thus much in his thought. O infernall furies are you not all hyred against mée? or is it creadible that either <name rend="roman">Iupiter</name>, or <name rend="roman">Saturne</name>, or <name rend="roman">Mars</name>, or all the Gods maye haue the like force as this young mans. But <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> heart fayled him not, albeit his woordes outraged, for he followed the knyght of the Sunne who attended hym speadely. Then the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> sayde to the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> his vnckle, "wee make great account of the trauayles of the auncient <name rend="roman">Assirians</name> our forefathers, and of the <name rend="roman">Grecians</name> with whome our countreymen ioyned at the expedition of <name rend="roman">Troy</name>, but I cannot thincke that euer two so strong warriours haue ben as <name rend="roman">Africano</name> and <name rend="roman">Raiartes</name>.

You may boldly iustifie that, aunswered <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name>, for there was neuer vntil this day a battaile betwene two knights so valiaunt and sharp as this is, nor yet euer two so hardy drew swoords against eche other, although things before done carry a greater burden of authoritie then that which we our selues can testifie." But the ielousie which <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> had ouer the knight of the Sunne was not a little, to be iudge of so valiant behauiour, not that he had an ill eye towardes his friendes good Fortune, but either wishing to himselfe the like tryall, or desiring to aduenture with his friend, although not many dayes ended ere he had his fill to his contentment. <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> people looked euer for the victory, greatly forethincking them that any one knight should make resistaunce to their Lord, as hauing experience in themselues, which al shooke for feare to sée him angred. Now was it more then two houres since y^e battaile began, and then fortune alwayes fickle &amp; vnstable which had of a long time gone euen with <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, now played hir part in hir kinde, and as already wery of hys companie tourned hir tale, and stroke in an other waye, desirous to shewe the great swiftnesse of his euertourning whéele, and minding y^e sodeine ouerthrow of those which to much trust in hir. For <name rend="roman">Africano</name> desperately determining to breake vp the fight one way or the other: once againe hit the knight of the Sunne vppon his Magicall helmet that he tooke quyte his memory from the knight, the swoorde and the raines falling from him. Yet the swoorde hauging by a longe stringe at the pomell was not out of his reach, but the horse hauing the libertie of the raines, and féeling his part of the blowe <unclear>f</unclear>lange vp and downe the féelde with his master, the stronge <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> folwinge to haue vnhorsed him. But howe déere was this blowe to <name rend="roman">Africano</name> for it coste him no lesse then hys lyfe, for the valiant knight of the Sunne neuer stayned in fight, became woode madde for hys hurte, and in great rage tooke his sworde in both hys handes, and repayed
<pb n="119" ed="digital" entity="13801:45" pages="60"/><milestone n="60     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
the borrowed blowe so surely vpon <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> heade that not <name rend="roman">Vulcans</name> well tempered steele coulde forbid the passage, but that it quartered the helmette and made the braines sprinckle on the grounde. Nowe sounde yée trumpets, for in this wise is the great <name rend="roman">Africano</name> brought to grounde, ending his life in such sorte as is fatall to tyrantes, whose death commonly is cruell and bloudy. This the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and those of his part séeing, made such ioye as cannot bée tolde, but on the contrary side <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> people made great lamentation, and reckening little vppon that which their Lord in his lyfe time had commaunded, bicause they were more in number then theyr aduersaries, they ioyned together in heapes <foreign lang="la" rend="roman">sine discretione</foreign>, and without a guide made an assalte vppon the knight and his adherentes. But they not taken at unawares receiued them accordingly. These were the <name rend="roman">Souldam</name>, the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name>, the Prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, and <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> with the knight of the Sunne, in whose company they were the bolder, and comming to the foreward in the formost rancke, they finde of the stowtest and principallest knights that <name rend="roman">Africano</name> had. These foure encountred them and vnhorsed as many as they came against, &amp; breaking through the thickest thronge, they wrought wonders, especially the Prince of <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name> desirous to get honour in the first heade of his knighthoode shoued into the middest, beheading some, and mayminge other some, making as it were a lane before him to passe throughe, so that the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> sayd openly that now his outwarde sight dyd well witnesse the selfe same thing which his Arte had shewed him in casting y^e constellation of this Knyght, for hée was a valiant knight, and the slaughter he made was nygh hand comperable with that of the knight of y^e Sunne. Vppon y^e left winge prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> tryed his manhood hauing néere vnto him the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name>. Where (be it that otherwise to a stronge Gyant as <name rend="roman">Africano</name> was he was inferior,) yet amonge the other people hée was
<pb n="120" ed="digital" entity="13801:46" pages="61"/><milestone n="[61L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
as proude as a rauenous wolfe amonge a flocke of shéepe. The <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the good knight <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> did their part, but what would all this auailed, vnlesse the knight of the Sunne had bet the waye before them with his sharpe swoord slaying so many as it was easy for the followers to kéepe the troden path. And now at this time y^e <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> army appointed for the gard of the knight of the Sunne came to the battaile, and finding Fortune so courteous at their comming, they refused not hir gentlenesse, but following hir commaund, made it bloudy conflict for the aduersary. But yet a man may rightly say, that y^e knight of the Sunne deliuered that daye the <name rend="roman">Babilonians</name> from death or bondage, for if he had not ouercome <name rend="roman">Africano</name>, not the high walles of the Quéene <name rend="roman">Semiramis</name> could haue kept <name rend="roman">Africano</name> out from enioying the Citie. But their Lord béeing slayne and they left without an head, theyr courage was so quailed that ere two houres passed, the greater part of thē was slaine likewise, &amp; of those which remained on liue, the most part fledde by one and one, the <name rend="roman">Assirians</name> pursuing them till the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> commaunded the retreate to be blowen, fearing to be ouertaken by the night, by this meanes some escaped to their countrey, most of them béeing inhabitantes of <name rend="roman">Media</name>, where also was the abode of <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> son called <name rend="roman">Brandimardo</name>, not being able for yeares to be made knight, and therefore goinge not out with his father to y^e warre. These so soone as they came home crowned <name rend="roman">Brandimardo</name> and incensed him to the reuenge of his fathers death, for although he was of yeares younge and tender, yet was he very stronge and of a lusty body, béeing lyke vnto his father as well in stature as in qualities, and in déede béeing continually layde at by his fathers subiects, passing into <name rend="roman">Greece</name>, he behaued himselfe manifully as shall bee shewed you. Well the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and those which were with him as you haue heard, retourned in ioy and pleasure, and highly magnifying the noble knight of y^e Sunne, so as this discourse as an

argument of greate good will canuased betwéene these knights and Princes brought them ere they were wel aware before the pallayce gate, where the Princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name> welcomed them with torch light, the first whome shée embraced was the Knight of the Sunne to whome shee sayd on this wise. "Syr knight we haue great cause to giue thancks to our gods for your hether ariual. First you deliured my Lorde the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and me from death, &amp; now you haue set all vs frée from sorrowfull captiuitie." But madame aunswered the knight of the sunne, to my Lord the Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> and to these other knights you ought to attribute this, for they are those which haue destroyed <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> hoast. Then the Princesse tourned to <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> and thancked him lykewise for his paynes in the defence of hir fathers citie, and so to the rest in that order which best lyked hir. After this they supped in the great hall, continuing there their sports till bedtime, as lykewise the citizens wel shewed their good lyking of the victory by bonfires and other reuelling sport.

Wherefore I thincke it conuenient, that sithe the Gods haue graunted vs this victory, and that we haue the winde at our backes that we followe our good Fortune while we haue hir, least by ouerslipping the opportunitie, we to late repēt our to much daintines. My meaning is y^t with such speed as may be, y^e Prince <name rend="roman">Florion</name> &amp; these Lords depart the realme into <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, there to make claime of his right by armes, whilst euery man is occupied in complayning on his owne harmes. For although as yet there dare no man stande against vs, yet for a certeintie there is a king of <name rend="roman">Media</name><name rend="roman">Africanos</name> sonne, which ere it be longe wilbe our heauy neighbour, he is not yet made knight, but his desteny foresheweth vs that if he once come to boord in <name rend="roman">Persia</name> we shalbe no lesse disquyeted w^t his company, then we were with <name rend="roman">Africano</name> his father."

This they dealt in effectually, for within the compasse of the dayes limitted they lefte <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the Princesse onely comforted with the hope which <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeos</name> made promise off.</p><p>The fiftéene thousande knightes with the footemen by long iourneyes entring into <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, and comming néere vnto one of the chiefest cities of the kingdome, there in the plaine vnloded their carriage to erect their tents there. But the citizens hauing vnderstanding of <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> death by the fugitues in the last discomfiture of <name rend="roman">Africanos</name> hoast, and thinking it not safetie for themselues to rebell agaynst their liege and naturall Lorde <name rend="roman">Florion</name> especially he hauing the aide of y^e whole floure of <name rend="roman">Babilō</name>, set their gates wide open for hys armye, &amp; sent of theyr worthyest knights to <name rend="roman">Florions</name> tent to inuite him to his owne citie, and to craue pardon for their former reuoulting, in that time when they were lefte destitute of mans succour, not being able of themselues to withstand the force of <name rend="roman">Africano</name>.

requisite that the king himselfe should tarry behinde for the appeasing of all tumults if any should arise in so raw a possession, he gaue the charge of fetching the Queene with all reasonable pompe, vnto the Knight of the Sun and the Prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> they to take with them 200 knights for their safetie. They tooke it gladly, and fray<gap reason="illegible" extent="3 letters"/> their shippes with necessary prouision and other furniture for war, determining to trauayle by sea the sooner to come vnto their iourneyes ende. When euery thing was in a readinesse the knights tooke their leaue of y^e king <name rend="roman">Florion</name> and the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name>. But the wiseman not refrayning from teares, and louingly embracing the knight of the Sunne, burst out into these speaches in such sorte as the <name rend="roman">Sibilles</name> in auncient time were wont to read mens destenyes. "Noble and worthy knight, you are determined to see <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, but you are vncerteyne whether euer to see it, or to retourne to <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, and as little know I what shall befall. For truth it is, that all the heauenly sphéeres warrāt more vnto you then to any knight, what that is, it is kept from me, I cannot finde the entry therevnto wherefore I am in doubte of your hether retourne. But if the fates, or otherwise the course of the starres which impose a necessitie to man, carrie you beyond the compasse of your will into a farre country wher ther shall be greater neede of your presence, grudge not at it, but giue thancks to our gods. For all shal redound to your honour and the mangifiyng of your lignage.

In a worde <name rend="roman">Lyrgrandeo</name> shall neuer fayle you in the thing, wherein either his wealth or wisedome maye stande you in stéede, and the day shall come wherein you being in the countrey wher you were borne, and amongst your owne parents, shall account them all for enemyes and yet no man shall take your part but only <name rend="roman">Lyrgrandeo</name>, which for that time shall saue your lyfe, and I hope that this seruice shall not be the last in account, or the least in value which I wyll doe vnto you. The wise man ended, and they all which were present wondered to heare hym so diuine of things to come." But the Knight of the Sun not venderstanding the tenour of this prophecye, wisely referred all things to Gods prouidence, thanking the wise man for his great care ouer him.</p><p>Nowe when on all partes all countesies were perfourmed and that the king <name rend="roman">Florion</name> had commended them to his gods, they embarked themselues, and spredding their sayles followed the waye towardes <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> as the chapter following shall declare.</p></div><div id="mirrour028" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">The Knight of the Sunne and the Prince Clauergudo being in their way towards Babilon, were deuided by a sodayne aduenture.

prosperously vnto a man, albeit mountayns of aduersitie impugne &amp; assaile him, yet can they neuer expugne his good Fortune, but in the ende he recouereth his quyet reste inaugre the malice of misaduenture. And so the issue declared in the knight of the Sunne. For the ix. daye after that the knight of y^e Sunne, <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, and those which wer w^t them had sailed in y^e <name rend="roman">Persicke</name>sea, y^e night attached them ouercast with darke clouds without any starres appearing whereby the marriners construed the roughnesse of y^e wether on y^e morrow, &amp; therfore guided towards land to cast anchor in some good herberowe till y^e stormes ceased. Eare the dawning of the day they discouered a docke not farre from the continent in their séeming very commodious, but in deede very daungerous as it proued. Entring the docke, they scarce had leasure to throw out their anchors but two other shipps ioyned with them to séeke some safe roade out of the tempest. These which last got to the port were very desirous to knowe what the ether might be, and therefore an armed knight so huge and great as if he had bene a Gyant mounting on the shippe boord called aloude vnto them to aunswere him. Some of the other shippe hearing him in this wise crying, leapte vpon the hatches saying. What is it sir knight that you would haue? "Mary I would know aunswered the knight what you are and whether you will." One of the company being stoute and of ill behauiour, and supposing thys knight to be some Gyant of that countrey minding to set vpon them, made him aunswere thus. "Retourne to thy dwelling, and bee not carefull to knowe them which knowe not thée, otherwyse assure thy selfe heere are knightes which will chase thée hence in such sorte as it shal wel grieue thée." The strange knight stomacking this rudenesse, sayde agayue. "Assuredly knighte thou arte some vilayne borne or of base byrthe, sithe in such order thou rewardest me demaunding onely vpon courtesie, but seing I cannot learne it of the with thy good will, I will"

compell thée therevnto with thine ill will, and saying no more be droue at the knight so strongly that he claue both shielde, helmette, and head vnto the eyes. O what a mischéefe doth ill speach breed vnto man, &amp; how inexcusable was it in this knighte when he redemed this franke speach with his owne lyfe, and solde to make payment the lyfe of many others. An other knight seing his fellowe slayne, stept into his roome, and smote at the straunger, where by the clattering of theyr harnesse, the dinne was so great that it raysed the people on both partes by clusters. And there was a great fray betwixt them, the knight of the Sunne nor <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> witting of it, till the great knight had ouerthrowen and put to death fiue or sixe of those knightes which came néerest to hande.</p><p>The Knighte of the Sunne seing his knigh<sic>et</sic>s so destroyed, especially by this greate knighte leauing the others bent his force agaynst him, and strake him a blowe ouerthwart the headpeece making him to abate his courage. The great knight aunswered the loane, and the battayle was verye hotte betwéene them, for thoughe the night was darke yet they knewe where to hitte aswell by the flames which spring out of their helmettes as the clashing of their armour. <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> put himselfe amongst the thickest and at his first godmorrow slew tenne knigths and then not finding with whome to fights, hee lepte into his enemyes shippe with his vncle <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> where he felled more then xxx. knightes, and the skirmish beganne a fresh either part willing to helpe theirs, and the foure shippes grapled together, so that the fighte would haue ben dangerous if it had lasted lōger, but halfe an houre &amp; a little more ouerpassed, y^e tempest which before threatened to appeare now outraged, &amp; the port not verye sure, the iii<unclear>i</unclear>. ships were deuided by the storme euery one withdrawing himselfe to séeke succour. Now in the ship wherein the knight of the Sunne and the great knighte foughte there were no more knyghtes but they two,
<pb n="128" ed="digital" entity="13801:49" pages="65"/><milestone n="[65L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
for all followed <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> into the other shippes. The two knights left alone were so earnest that they tooke little keepe either of the tempest or of their daunger. The succes of y^e battayle was doutefull, sometimes enclining to y^e one part sometimes to y^e other, neither part quailing, but gathering their strengthes to them by the emulation of each other. For y^e knight of the Sunne verely beleued that excepte his enemye had bene some such as <name rend="roman">Africano</name> was he could neuer haue abid those mortall strokes: and the other knighte thought aswell that no manes force could be macheable with the knights, and either of them both had better cause to thanke <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeos</name> kindenesse, especily this strange knight at this time, for had not his armour kept out y^e edge of y^e other knights armant sword he could not haue prolongued y^e battayle till day lyght, yet at y^t time he was so ouermatched y^t if a sodayn aduēture had not broke vp their fight, he had ended his lyfe in that place.</p><p>But when it was broad day by this the battayle surceased, that the straunge knighte knewe the deuise of the Sunne vpon the knight of the Sunnes helmette, which when he espyed letting his sworde fall, and lifting vppe his beuere, he cast himselfe at the knights féete with this speach. "Oh my Lord the Knight of the Sunne pardon I pray your friende who my meere ignoraunce, hath made vpon your person, and who acknowledgeth in your suche souereigne vertue as may not be in other but in those to whome our gods haue imparted of their goodnesse. For if the day had lyngred, or that the morning had not bene somewhat cleare I should haue receiued a full paymente for my rashnesse: and saying this, he would haue embraced <name rend="roman">Del Febos</name> knees. Now the kngiht of the Sunne so soone as y^e others visour was pulled vp knew well that he was the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> whom his father not willing to make knighte before his yeares were more, had lefte with the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> in <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>. For he was scarcely eigh-

tene yeares of age, yet béeing in armour he was as byg as you haue heard off, and taking courage vpon his stature, in his Fathers absence hee laye at the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> his graundfather to be dubbed knight, thincking it longe till he were with his father, and his great friendes the knight of the Sunne, and the Prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>. So after y^t he had obteined his sute of his graundfather he demaunded licence of departure of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the princesse <name rend="roman">Balisea</name> his mother to passe into <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, which was graunted him, and two shippes charged with ij.C. knights to conuaye him thether, where after the fourth dayes sayling that chaunsed to him, which the historie hath recounted. But to retourne, as soone as the knight of the Sunne knewe his déere friende the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> very glad to haue found him so valiant and hardy he embraced him hartely, and so they communed of their owne affaires, and the desire that each had to see others. But as they began their seuerall stories by enterchaunge of speach, first one and then an other: The Marriners cryed that the shippe rent in péeces. So some lepte into the water, and other threwe out planckes to saue themselues by, and the knight of the Sunne finding the cockeboate néere vnto him, let it downe into the water by a cable, &amp; calling the prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, he lept into it first himselfe. Thus muche is ordinary in the course of worldly things, but that which is to come is beyond the credit of a storie as it were an extraordinary myracle. For when the knight of the Sunne lept into the boate, the cable rent in péeces, and with the force of the iumpe, and the rage ofthe windes together, the boate launched into the depth, that the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> coulde not followe hym, but gotte into a little boate whiche the gouernour of the shippe had before taken. But by and by after these Princes had thus escaped, the shyppe wherin they had bene, tore in péeces wyth the storme. Some béeing drowned, and other some in no little daunger, as

the waues began to swell, so euer prognosticatinge of their owne deathes. The knight of the Sunne saylinge alone in the vessell, and in such feare of destruction was not so stoute harted as to contemne the sencelesse element, but confessinge the imbecilitie of mannes power subiected vnder these weake thinges as fyre and water, besides causalties infinite more, hée commended hymselfe vnto hys Gods by earneste prayer, not yet onely for hymselfe, but also for his friende <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, not beeing able to diuine of his deliueraunce. Sittinge thus in the baote all pensiue, till the wyndes were somewhat alayed, and the Sea waxed more calme, afterwardes hée looked about hym and sawe that hée was out of daunger, with other two thinges whiche made hym more to meruayle. The one was the great foyzon and plentie of all victualles, sufficient to a man for many dayes, the other was the swyftnesse of the boate in the Sea, hauinge neyther sayle nor oare to rule it, and musinge of this in his thought, hee coniectured presently that it should be done by <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name>, and therefore as very glad of suche a mans friendshippe in so needeful a time, hee gaue hym thanckes as hartely as if he had seene hym there. In thys order hee was vppon the Sea many dayes wythout knowing whether the wynde woulde dryue hym, tyll that from out of y^e <name rend="roman">Persians</name> Seas he came into the <name rend="roman">Occean</name>, and so coastinge the whole countrey of <name rend="roman">Asia</name>, lying vppon that sea, he was carried into <name rend="roman">Africke</name>, which stretcheth vppon the wyde West Seas. In which countrey the historye leaueth hym tyll an other wynde serueth, nowe it proceedeth with the storye of hys friendes, <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> and <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, who were on the Seas tossed in lyke manner. <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> as the storye tolde you boorded his enimies with fiftie knyghtes in his companye and made greate hauocke of them, so that he had not left any of them alive if the storme had not risen so greatly. For the windes were so outragious betweene

them, and when they coulde stande no longer on shypboorde to trye it out, they lefte not off, to aske who each other was, the one party sayde we are <name rend="roman">Babilonians</name>, and the other, we are <name rend="roman">Persians</name>, all this happened in good time, for when they knew each other, they fel not againe to quareling, but they agreed to emptie their ships, thereby to auoide the daunger. So <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> hauing new leasure to looke about him, the battaile béeing ended, and not finding the knight of the Sunne, nor the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, withall remembring howe he had left them twaine in fighting, was greatly afraide least that the knight of the Sunne should endaunger the prince, before the one should know the other. Therefore he beseeched God like a good christian to deliuer thē both, &amp; to make them know each other, thereby to make greater account the one of y^e other, &amp; it is to be thought that this his prayer was heard, for the second day following the storme slacked,   the ship wherin they sayled arriued to a porte, not farre from a place where they were newly rigged. There they had not staied an houre, but that they sawe the boate in which the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> was. The mariners in <name rend="roman">Brandizels</name> boat not béeing perfect in the hauen, woulde not venture to take landing there, but coasting a longe they passed by y^e shyps to finde some more safe place to land in. The prince was ascried by his mē in his ships, &amp; therfore they made signes vnto y^e gouernour to stere towards thē, so y^e gouerneur vnderstanding y^e tokens, guided thether. The prince <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name> &amp; his vnckle <name rend="roman">Armineo</name>, standing on the hatches redy to welcome the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name>, betweene whom there were shewed tokens of great good wil, &amp; each made much of other as two faithful friends. But questioning about y^e knight of y^e Sunne. The Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> declared the manner of their parting, &amp; the daunger wherin he had left him. This caused great sorrow in thē, for they loued him as derely as any father his childrē or any wife hir husbā. And to assawge their griefe, <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> remēbred vnto them

the wordes which the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> had spoken to the knyght of the Sunne at his departure. Whereby they were perswaded that his departure by such a chaunce was but for the achiuement of things more worthy of him alone, and for whom onely they were reserued. Now hauing stayed in this hauen two dayes to repayre their shippes, when they were in a readinesse they sayled towardes <name rend="roman">Babilon</name> where they were goodly receyued of the <name rend="roman">Souldan</name> and the Queene, both very ioyfull of the newes as touching <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, and the king <name rend="roman">Florions</name> peaceable possession, and agayne as sorrowfull for the losse of the knight of the Sunne, and the perill of death wherein <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> sawe him last. But in short time after there were letters receiued from <name rend="roman">Lirgandeo</name>, conteining the certeintie of hys safetie, the manner of his escape, &amp; the affaires wherein he was employed. Which last point bred a great desire in <name rend="roman">Clauergudo</name>, &amp; <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> to stray through the world, and to exercise the feats of armes. And a while after they had rested themselues in <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, they brought the Quéene to <name rend="roman">Persia</name> by land, for they woulde nor more aduenture the Seas, especially hauinge the Quéene as parte of their burthen, and the historie bryngeth them on their waye as farre as <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, whence it retourneth towarders <name rend="roman">Hungary</name> to matters of lyke importaunce, wherein the younger sonne of <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> had to deale, whose prowesse is no lesss worthy my paynes, then hys brothers valoure is worthy of your remembraunce, for hée surpassed all other knyghtes in loyaltie and might, béeing equall to <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> in all pointes, as héereafter you shall héere.</p></div><div id="mirrour029" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The Princesse Briana discouered to Rosicleer secretly that he was hir sonne.

For he was so gracious, as that he was beloued not onely of his mother, but of the other gentlewomen also which might not one minute spare his company, as if he had bene childe to euery one. This <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> when he atteined to the age of .xij. yeares, remoued out of the monastery to a house hard by, where his nourse <name rend="roman">Leonardo</name> kept, whom he thought to be his father.

as if he had professed already a vowe in some cloyster, and his minde euer ranne vpon his desire to be made knight, to the ende he myght experiment the aduentures of the worlde, &amp; learne by proofe that which he had often heard by rehearsall. Héerevnto hauing no hope nor helpe by this restraint it abated his chéere &amp; encreased his sadnesse. <name rend="roman">Leonardo</name> his nourse marking in what plight he was oftē demaunded the occasion of his heauinesse, but could by no meanes wringe it out of him, and so one daye talking with the Princesse, hée tolde hir that vnlesse she founde a remedy for hir sonne, his thought would anoy him. The princesse very pensiue at that which <name rend="roman">Leonardo</name> had told, commaunded <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to be brought before hir presence. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> comming into the presence of the Princesse, knéeled downe, and humbly asked what was hir graces pleasure. The Princesse bidding him stande vp, spake thus. "<name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, thy father <name rend="roman">Leonardo</name> telleth mée thou art neuer mery, nowe therefore open to me the cause of this thy heauinesse, and if thou wantest ought whiche thy father can not supply, vtter it fréely, and I will prouide thée of the remedy to haue thée contented." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> hearing the woordes of the Princesse, knéeling downe againe, and sayde. "Madame I kisse you hande for the souereigne grace you shewe mée in hauinge suche compassion on my griefe, and I am well assured that if it were for any thing wheroff I haue néede, your Ladyship would furnish me of it, as hitherto you haue done, but if I bée sadde or solitary for any thing which grieueth me, it is not for neede of any necessarye prouision, for I thancke your goodnesse, I haue had it hetherto aboundantly considered by your highnesse without my speakinge.

When <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had thus sayd, the princese féeling already in him y^e heroicall stomack of his father Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> (as she thought) and calling to minde the continuall casualties of knights arrant, burst into teares in great aboundaunce, which occasioned great ruth in the young <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, but y^t he durst not demaund the reason. After a while the Princesse to withdrawe hir sonne from his thought, or by some meanes to remitte his griefe &amp; to cōfort him, stretching hir armes ouer his neck, said vnto him. "O my sonne <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, already thy valiant heart doth manifest that which so long time for mine honestie sake I haue concealed, this is that thou art the sonne of my Lord and lawful husband the prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name>, begotten in wedlocke, but my parents vnwitting thervnto. Thy fathers likenesse in other qualities thou dost wel resemble, albeit his fauour is cleane out of my remembraunce. Thou canst not be content with the lyfe which thou nowe leadest, voyde of all daunger, but couetest to bée made knight, and to ieopard thy person in the search of aduentures as thy father did.

conformable to thy estate. In the meane while reste thée héere, for it may so bée that I shall in that time heare some newes of the Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> or of <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name>, which if it so fall out, then shall thy absence be lesse grieuous vnto mée, when <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> heard y^e secret which the Princesse his mother bewrayed vnto him, he was well apayed as touching his thought of béeing made knight, before the basenesse of his foster father hanging in his light, and now hée reckened the rather to vndertake the highest exploytes whereto his heart draue him, and knéeling downe before hir, he kissed hir hand for the secrecie which she concionated with him touching his true originall. His mother by the outward ioye he made, supposing his former thought to be put out of conceite was very glad, but y^e Princesse was deceiued in him. For <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> hearing himselfe to bée named the sonne of so mighty princes, if before he wished to be made knight, either of a wanton delight or for some greater occasiō, now he thirsted gréedely after knighthood, as thincking himself bound in conscience to aduaunce his lignage in the right of his parents, and his care encreased howe to steale from thence. This care he couered the best wayes y^t he might, &amp; stayed with his mother comforting hir in all that he coulde, vntill that the Princesse went to hir lodginge, and he retourned with <name rend="roman">Leonardo</name> who onely hearde that which the Princesse had declared.

Now that it was nighte and that this was his onely refuge, he made his horse easely descende the hill, at the foote whereof he espyed a sauage Beare running from the towne with a childe in his mouthe of two yeares olde.

For we haue a Prince and Lorde ouer vs in times past good and gratious, but as God hath prouided for our mistyuing, in our time very cruell and vicious, he hath to name <name rend="roman">Argion</name>, who according as his power by reason of his exceding wealth which the country yeldeth, is not to be contraried, so I beleue of lyfe he is the most peruerst and wickedest vnder heauen. For among other his diuelish &amp; detestable customs which he ordinarily obserueth, &amp; besides the impouerishing of his poore tenauntes racking them shamefully to enhaunce his tresory, and besides the dayly raunsoming of his neighbours lyues and goods at his pleasure for euery lyttle displeasure cōceiued against vs. This is one y^e most vngodly of al, y^t euery weke he enioineth vs to finde him a gētlewoman for his carnall liking. This vse he hath frequented this foure yeares so ouerawing vs and murtheringe such as make denyall that now there are none to make resistaunce, and hys fact now growen vnto a habite by our patience perforce, and his force in spight of our patience is nothing straunge vnto vs, that now all of vs obey his heast in being bawdes vnto our children, so that it would riue a mans heart a sunder to heare the faire damzells curse the lyght into the which their parents brought them only to fulfil the shamelesse lust of so tragicall a tyrant. And to my share it is falne that hauing one onely daughter the fayrest in all this valley, since she hath bene

fiftéene yeares of age I haue euery day expected hir sending for. If I ought coulde remedy it I would either murther my daughter or banish hir my countrey to release hir of so great an infamy: but <name rend="roman">Argion</name> is so wicked and diuelish, that this will not suffise him, but rather if he be defrauded of his bargaine, wee shall all dye for hir sake." Héere y^e aūcient man was so ouertaken with griefe that he might not vtter a worde more, his name was <name rend="roman">Balides</name>. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> angred at the heart to hear of the mallice of the wretch <name rend="roman">Argion</name>, would haue giuen away the possibilitie of his lyueloode to haue bene made knight, onely to haue set the lande free from so intollerable slauery, and therfore he appoynted with himselfe when he were made knight to England, to retourne hether and to wage battayle with <name rend="roman">Argion</name>. And so still deuising of such things he came to the castell of <name rend="roman">Balides</name>, where he alyghted and was frindly entertayned by the auncient mans wife, and the young gentlewoman their daughter named <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name>, both greatly praysing <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> good fauour and feature of body, but much more his courage when they vnderstoode that he had delyuered the childe by killyng the Beare. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> séeing the gentlewoman faire and proper, and yet very sad for that <name rend="roman">Argion</name> had sent hir worde that he shortly looked for hir, was greatly moued, and the rather for y^t he knewe not how to acquit hir. <name rend="roman">Balides</name> at his first comming in, commaunded the supper to bee made readye, in the meane while taking <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> a side to a window opening into the valley, and questioning with him of his birth and of the aduenture which brought him thether. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> aunswered, "I am borne in <name rend="roman">Hungary</name>, and I am to trauaile about my affayres into great <name rend="roman">Britayne</name>, and being on my way this morning I lost my selfe in the woode, which was the occasion of my hether comming."

Cap. xxix.</head><p>THe supper being ready <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, with <name rend="roman">Balides</name> his wife and children sate at the table but there was little discourse at the boord saue that the beautifull <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> felt so great griefe in y^e remembrance of <name rend="roman">Argions</name> message that in lieu of meat she fed on teares, and hir parents helped to bere a part with their sighs, which made it a very melencholicke supper vnto <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. And in the <unclear>nec</unclear>ke of this, ere the cloth was taken vp, they hearde great rapping at the gate, and looking who they were, they saw more then xx. knights &amp; other seruingmen, with torches in their handes at the gates. Those of the house demaunded what they would, one of them aunswered. Tell <name rend="roman">Balides</name> that <name rend="roman">Argion</name> our lord hath commaunded vs to bring <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> by and by, for he tarieth for hir to haue hir company this night. O how vnwelcome was this arrant vnto the parents, and how pitifull vnto the gentlewoman, which swounded at the hearing of <name rend="roman">Argions</name> name, and all the householde wepte bitterly. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> for company moued to great pitie, with the best courage that he might to giue remedye vnto this outrage, deuised a present shifte and bid some of the seruauntes to tell those which were without that they should stay a while vntill the gentlewomen were in a readines, and after that, that she should be sent vnto them. Then he made the coūlyest apparell which <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> had to be brought vnto him, and clothed himselfe with all, making for his head a periwcke of <name rend="roman">Lyuerbas</name> haire, &amp; binding it with a little chain of gold, so that being thus readily arayed he was so beautifull as not gentlewoman thereabouts might parage him for grace or fauour. His hoste &amp; hostes wer amazed in beholding him so well bere out y^e credite of a gentlewoman, in his disguised habite, neither yet knowing what he ment therby nor yet minding to learne it of him vnles he first declared it. But

so soone as he was throughly arayed in this wise, he softly rounded his hoste in the eare saying. "My friende your mishap &amp; the thraldome of this lande hath had such force ouer me y^t hauing hope in God which brought me hether, I wil take vpon me to be <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> and wil go with these knights to the castle of <name rend="roman">Argion</name>. When I am alone in his chamber, I will behaue my selfe God willing, that I will frée you from this mans tyranny, <sic>O</sic>r alhough I be slain in the execution of this enterprice, yet it were a small damage in respect of so great a cure. But I would haue you <name rend="roman">Balides</name>, your sonnes and your other acquaintaunce and friends to arme your selues lykewise and lye couertly a little from the castle, where if you sée that I make you any tokens by the lyght at a window make accounte that <name rend="roman">Argion</name> is slayne, and be not afrayed to come néere the gates which I will set open for you &amp; so with little adoe we shall make our selues Lords of his castle. When this is done we wil publish it abroade to the inhabitaunts of the valley, which being certein of <name rend="roman">Argions</name> death will rise to our succour." <name rend="roman">Balides</name> looked wisely vpon <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and wondred at his courage, for he being so young, it was in his fancie the boldest match which he had hearde off, yet, thoughe it was impossible as he thought to come to their purpose, for that he saw how willingly <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had made this offer, he consented to call his friendes, esteming it sarce better to dye in such a quarrell then to sée &amp; suffer so great a mischefe. The gētlewomā <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> being made priuie therevnto by hir father knéeled downe before <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, &amp; shedding aboundance of teares sayd vnto him. "The God which created both heauen &amp; earth graunt you faire gentlemā so good hap y^t both this land may be acquit from this tyranny, and I delyuered form this vilayny." The knights which were without hasted to haue the gentlewomā with them, &amp; so <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> putting a sword vnder his kirtle closely and surely that it coulde neither be perceiued, nor fall from him, hee tooke his leaue of <name rend="roman">Balides</name>,

his wife, and his daughter. <name rend="roman">Balides</name> wishing him well and commending him to God, accompanied him to the gates where the knights were attendant, and there poured out so many teares to the outward sight as if it had bene his daughter. The people without hauing a glimps of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> by the lyght of the torches, tooke him to be the fayrest gentlewoman which they had eyer seene, and verye glad to bring so good tidings vnto their mayster, they set him vppon a palfray prouided for the purpose, only they were agrieued at the time which was so short that they could not sufficiently gaze on hir. Their whole talke by the way ran vpon this that it were for <name rend="roman">Argion</name> more conuenient to detaine hir for wife, then euery wéeke to seeke a new, and laughing at their owne deuises they came to <name rend="roman">Argions</name> Castle, being very great and of buylding the most sumptuous in the valley as it had bene a kings pallayce. In this they entered and helping the fayned <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> from hir horse, they led hir vp a payre of staires into a chamber where <name rend="roman">Argion</name> awited hir comming. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> kéeping a demure and sober countenaunce, droue <name rend="roman">Argion</name> into a great amaze at his beautie, that gredely beholding him he arose from the place where he was sette, and embraced him in these termes. You are welcome hether my <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> for you make me right gladde to haue your company, and for that your beautie is more then the rest, I wyll do you more honoure then to others. The fayned <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> countenaunced out his counterfait with graue behauiour, onely fixing his eyes vpon the grounde, without aunswering a worde, saue that he thought vpon his purpose which he knewe would be somewhat daungerous in that <name rend="roman">Argion</name> was strong, fowle, and fierce of looke more then he had euer seene any. <name rend="roman">Argion</name> tooke him by the hande, and placed him next himselfe, demaunding first how hir parents did, and from thence he fell to more amorous delights, stil staring on <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> beauty which throughly kindled his lust, and he desired hir to vnclothe

hir selfe, and to come vnto him in the rich bedde. This supposed <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> framing a shamefast and bashfull looke, with a lowe voyce gentle aunswered him, "that unlesse he commaunded his seruants to auoyde the chamber and the doores to bée fastened, she would not be séene naked in that company." <name rend="roman">Argion</name> taking it to bée an argument of great honestie did of his clothes first, and lepte into his bedde, commaunding his people to goe out, and shut y^e doores after them. They lighting a great candle set on a candlestick of siluer went out, &amp; ther remained onely this <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> with <name rend="roman">Argion</name>, leisurely vnclothing hir selfe to delay time, and that the seruauntes shoulde mistrust naught by hearing a bustling in the chamber, first shée put off hir vpper gowne, then to hir peticoate, and so she stayed a whyle, <name rend="roman">Argion</name> callinge on hir to dispatche quickely, as if the greatest part of his delight had bene to come. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> thincking it nowe time to discouer <sic>hir</sic> selfe, and that the houre was already come wherein God almightie woulde the wicked <name rend="roman">Argion</name> to bé chastised, cast of his long garmet, &amp; tourned himselfe into his doublet and hose, and hauing his sword drawen, he came to <name rend="roman">Argions</name> bed side, saying, "come out of thy place where y^e art thou foule letcher, &amp; come to reioice thée of <name rend="roman">Liuerbas</name> loue, for very bitter shall this nightes rest bee vnto thée." <name rend="roman">Argion</name> which behelde him rose vp lightly, and taking a swoorde which hong at hys beddes head, went towards <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to haue catched hym in his armes, but <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with his naked swoord watched him so y^t he smote the necke from the shoulders, the heade beating agaynst the wall, and the body falling headlesse to the grounde. This done, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> quietly sate downe in the same place, and thus remained till the greater parte of the nyght was spent. <name rend="roman">Balides</name> nowe in this time had not forgotten his charge, and hauing talked with more then xx. of his friends, as concerning their entent, he easely perswaded them to this enterprise, so hauing thē in his company

with his sonnes he lodged néere to <name rend="roman">Argions</name> castell, onely looking for a signe which <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> should make them out at a windowe, which when <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>had for a time neclected, they supected y^e vnlikelihood of the fact, &amp; had retourned closely to their homes, if y^t <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had not thē taking y^e light in his hand, opened y^e doores of the hall &amp; shewed the tourch out of the window. Then they knew what had happened, &amp; went ioyfully toward the castel. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> cōming downe, opened the gates, so that they all entered, &amp; lighting many torches which they brought with them they cast thēselues into seuerall cōpanies to serch euery corner &amp; ranging without feare, throughout the castel when they knew that <name rend="roman">Argion</name> was slaine, &amp; killing so many as they found that in déede though there were mo then an .100. knights and other seruaunts within the castel, yet all were slaine before they could puruay of armour, or thinck of remedy, in such sort that in the castel ther was not one left to take <name rend="roman">Argions</name> part. At <name rend="roman">Argion</name> may the stout Lords &amp; vntamed tyrants take example of their endes, &amp; make it a benefit of his fall, for although God sometime forbere the wicked giuing them space of amendement and repentaunce, yet when they can in no wise be reclaimed, his iustice must of necessitie correct them in the manner that both their bodyes repaye in this life their trespasses with cruell death and perpetuall deshonour, and their soules in the other world reciue dubble disgrace and horrour of conscience for their misdéedes: Howe many great Lordes &amp; tyrants haue we read off to haue bene in the worlde, and howe fewe or none haue we heard off vnpunished which can be no other thing but that the diuine prouidence hathe so ordeined it, some to be chastised for the misgournment of themselues, and other some to amend by the terrour of others distruction: Well, the tyrant <name rend="roman">Argion</name> thus béeing slaine with all this people, <name rend="roman">Balides</name> and those which came with him for his great prowesse in killing <name rend="roman">Argion</name>, sued vnto <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, to acknowledge them for his subiectes,
<pb n="147" ed="digital" entity="13801:58" pages="74"/><milestone n="74     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
as they would willingly obey him for their Lord. But he seuerally making semblaunce of great loue to euery partie made them to rise, aduising them on this sort. That for their deliueraunce they ought to attribute it vnto God with harty thanckes for it which by his goodnesse had prouided y^e euill lust of wicked <name rend="roman">Argion</name> should last no longer. But for that they called him their Lord, he said he would be their friend, and neuerthelesse sith they requested him therevnto, y^t he would not refuse their proffer, not for himselfe, but in déede to giue order to that whiche should succeede for the quiet gouerment of the seignorie. This done, <name rend="roman">Balides</name> sent for his wife and his daughter <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name>, with his householde, they comming before <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> gaue him thancks for this great good tourne in procuring their safetie. He receiued them with great pleasure, and they made méery all that night. The next daye they deuised for the publication of <name rend="roman">Argions</name> death, which <name rend="roman">Balides</name> made to be knowne to the most principall in the valley. They all very desirous of such newes came to the castell, where knowing the manner of <name rend="roman">Argions</name> ende, much praysing the strength and boldenesse of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, with all séeing him so well fauoured and of so younge yeares, they ceased not to giue hym thanckes for the good which he had done, so that <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> somewhat blushing at it forbad them to speake more of it, but to attend their own affayres, for the valley béeing so replenished with dwellers all of them were not sounde, but for feare or fauour were <name rend="roman">Argions</name> clawbackes. These they had to doe with all, and in theende suboued them, after wanting a gouernoure they besought <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to abyde wyth them and to take othes of their allegyaunce towardes him, for sith that by him they haue bene restored to their auncient lybertyes, they thought him to be an able maynteyner of theyr franchises, but <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> made them aunswere, that at the sute of <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name>, <name rend="roman">Argion</name> was slaine, and that hee moued with

pitie vpon hir, had enterprised it for hir sake, if therefore he had deserued ought, he wished them in respect thereof to make <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> mistresse of it, and for the establishment of hir possession to match hir vnto the chiefest inheritour of land and fée amongest them. This if they did for hys sake, he should account it not onely a satisfaction on their partes for the pleasure he had done them: but also a bond for a further good tourne if it so lye in his power. They debating vpon this matter were all contented with it and promised all their habilities to doe his commaund. So among them there was a knight called <name rend="roman">Brandidonio</name>, the chiefest of all the valley, a proper and honest gentleman, Lord of thrée great castels, and beloued of al the countrey for his bountie and courtesie, him they chose to marrie with <name rend="roman">Lyuorba</name> their Lady, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> very wel pleased with this gentlemans noble dispositiō, concluded vpon y^e marriage, so that in foure dayes the Lorde <name rend="roman">Brandidonio</name> &amp; the faire <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> were created Lord &amp; lady of the valley, and in token of obedience tooke the othe and assuraunce of their subiectes, where they liued longe time in quietnesse, their subiectes as well at ease to haue such gouernours.</p></div><div id="mirrour032" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ Rosicleer departed from the valley of the mountaines, meeteth with two Princes christened, &amp; by aduenture is carried from them againe.

the miserable subiection wherin <name rend="roman">Argion</name> had holden them, so they reuerenced and honoured hym, as if they had séene in him some vndoubted Image of immortalitie. But <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, this marriage béeing finished, hauinge no more to doe, make to assemble the greatest of the countrey, vnto whom he said, that he had vowed a voyage which might not be left off, and therefore now at his departure, he praied them to accept well of his so short tarrying, and in his absence to doe thée honour diligently to <name rend="roman">Brandidonio</name>, and <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name>, which was due vnto their liege Lord and louing Lady. They ouercharged with griefe for the lacke of him whō they loued as their nigh kinsman, layd to stay him by giftes and other offers, but when it booted not, they swore faith and obeysaunce towardes their Lord, and for a remembraunce of their loue, they forced vpon <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> an horse which was <name rend="roman">Argions</name>, a very tall and stronge horse which he refused, not as beeing very commodious to trauaile with, and then after this tooke his leaue of <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name>, hir father and mother, and <name rend="roman">Brandidonio</name> hir husband. Béeing ready to mounte on horsebacke, a younger brother of <name rend="roman">Lyuerb<unclear>a</unclear>s</name> called <name rend="roman">Telyo</name>, throwing himselfe on hys knées before <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, besought him to graunte hys sute, which <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> willingly promised, bidding hym saye on, <name rend="roman">Telyo</name> then sayde. "Syr sith you are to trauayle alone, and haue none to serue you by the waye, maye it please you to shewe me the <unclear>saueure</unclear> as to reteyne me for your squyer." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> well pleased wyth the good affection whiche <name rend="roman">Telyo</name> bare towardes hym, embraced <name rend="roman">Telyo</name> with muche loue, and thus made aunswere.

And sooth it is, that within a whyle after <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> departure, to the ende the straungenesse of their deliuery might be renued by their posteritie, and no age should leaue to speake thereoff, they founded a house of religion wyth a fayre Temple, wherein at the one side of the hyghe Altar they erected a pyller of marble very fayre and curious, bearinge the true counterfette of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, wyth the hystorye of <name rend="roman">Argion</name>, the fréeing of <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name>, and all that consequently followeth in that storye, so that in longe time after thys monumente of restoringe the inhabitantes, was founde by our age in the pursute of aduentures in that countrey. <name rend="roman">Brandidonio</name>, and <name rend="roman">Lyuerba</name> héere ruled long time in peace and tranquilitie, and from them descended all the Lordes whiche since haue had the gouernaunce of that valley.

and placed in two seuerall seates, to whome the other knightes in the shippe made their obeysaunce he tourned his face to haue gone out agayne. But the young knightes séeing <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and greatly delighted in his beautie and comlinesse of personage, called to him. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> tourninge towardes them made lowe reuerence as vnto so greate estates. The knightes receiuing him with as greate courtesy, demaundinge of him gentelye what countreyman hee was, and what he sought there. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> looking vpon them sadly, and soberly aunswered.

The king of the great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name> called <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name>, considering that the losse of the Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> his sonne, noised through his Empyre for .xv. yeares space had so appalled the courages of his knightes that neither feastes were made, nor turneys proclaymed, nor any disportes vsed with gentlewomen in his countrey, whereby to fyre the heartes of younge men to the déedes of armes. But that either all of them ouercome with griefe, and mourning still for his sonne, forsooke to weare armour, or els such as their owne good natures pricked forwardes to try aduentures, departed out of hys realme, in other regions to become famous, so that the kingdome of <name rend="roman">England</name> was very naked of able Knightes to defende it, wheras before it was best knowne in all the world for knighthood and chiualrie. The kinge I saye, wisely casting of these thinges, did not nowe so muche lament the lacke of his sonne, as fearing the inconuenience which might ensue by the want to good soldiers, if any enimy shoulde arise, prouided against this mischeife on this sort.</p><p>First taking the aduise of his counsell therein, he caused to bée proclaymed through euery shire and markette towne. That such knyghtes his subiectes as either were already departed, or nowe were in minde to depart the realme, for to surue in other Princes courtes, shoulde retourne to their homes by a day prefixed in the schedule, vppon payne of his high displeasure. This proclamation divulged abroade by the sound of a trumpet, as many as heard of it, either by their friendes letters, or by the rumour spred in other countries, retourned speadely, so that the king in a solumne triumph, taking the muster of hys speciall knightes, founde himselfe sufficiently furnished. Nowe the second care was, howe deteine them at home, and for this he deuised with his counsell to amke a highe feast in the Citie of <name rend="roman">London</name>, with iustes and turneys, for

This thus agreed vpon the king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> a yeare before that these feasts should begin directed his letters to all Princes Christened and otherwise as farre <name rend="roman">Turkey</name> certefiyng them that he had appoynted "iustes to be holden at his citye of <name rend="roman">London</name> and prices for the best doers, and that thether it shoulde bee frée for all knights to come and try their forces." The price was a massy crowne of golde al sette with pearles and precious stones valued by al mens deeming at the price of a great Citie. The newes hereof by the kings letters spredde ouer all countryes entised these two Princes lykewise being but of young yeares to craue to be made knightes by their parents, &amp; to trauayle towardes <name rend="roman">England</name>.

This was so pleasaunt vnto them as that in this contemplacion they spent the third parte of the night, about which time they heard the cry of a gentlewoman as it might be in some distresse. Then they looked baout them, and espyed a little crayer comming towardes them, in which there was a wilde man for making a Gyant, fierce of countenaunce and all hairy of body, of manners sauage, and cruell, hauing in one hande a knotted club wyth pikes at the ende of Iron, so heauy as a lesse man coulde not lyfte it: and in the other hande haling a faire gentlewoman by the hairs, hir face all bloody with the blowes he gaue hir, and punches with his feet. The Gyant full cryed. Tourne thy boate thou false and trayterous enchauntresse, or I will make thy lyfe to aunswere it mée, in that thou hast kepte me so long from it. The gentlewoman neuer aunswered him, but continually prayed vnto God for succours. This they both heard and sawe easely by Moonelyght, for the boate approched to their shippe, and the two other gentlemen were much abashed to sée so wilde a Gyant neere vnto them, for they had neuer seene his lyke before. But the noble courage of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> coulde not be so countermaunded by the Gyants hugenesse, as to suffer such vilany towards any gentlewomen, &amp; therfore setting his foote vpon the side of y^e ship &amp; taking his swoorde in his hand, he leaped into the gentlewomans boate.</p><pb n="155" ed="digital" entity="13801:61" pages="78"/><milestone n="78     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><p>Nature as it wer willing to manifest hir owne works and to discouer the secret graces, which shee before had couered in his comely personage. For so as if he had long time experimented the daunger of conflicts, boldely hee tooke vpon him this aduenture. At his first comming into the boate he strake not the Gyant, but with great moderation and more discretion then was needefull (but that he was verye circumspecte and in all things lowly,) hee sayd vnto the Gyant. "Leaue of Gyant to entreat thys gentlewoman in this sort, and way well, that it is great shame to a man for to laye his handes vpon a woman." The great Gyant lyttle respecting this courtesie, left the gentlewoman to haue taken vp <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, &amp; to haue throwen him into the water, but <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> perceiuing him, put his naked sworde poinaunt before him.</p><p>The Gyant rashly ranne vpon the swoorde, that it entred a lyttle, and therefore madde angrye at his wounde, he gaue backe, lyfting vp his greate batte with both hys handes to driue at <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. But <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> as destenyed to greater exployts, watching the blowe starte aside, and closing with the Gyant thrust his sworde into his guttes. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> pulled out y^e sword hastely to haue giuē him an other blowe, bu thte Gyant fell vpon the planks gasping for breath: then <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> stept vnto him, &amp; with mayne force tombled him ouer shipboorde, wher he lay drenched in the Sea.</p><p>All this the two Princes behelde and wondred at the great courage of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, but not a lyttle diseased in that they coulde not helpe him.

But if so bee they were not beguyled either by a dreame, or some fantasticall illusion, I dare warrant they thought that in regarde of that which God had wrought by him, he could not be, but of noble estate.

This wyse man my father hauing sent me on a message in this boat to a friend of his, Lord of an Iland not farre hence, my Fortune was such, that when I retourned by this Gyants Iland there entring on lande for fresh water, I was espyed by this Gyant, who made to me to haue taken me, but I fled towards my boat which I could not recouer so soone, but that he entred with me.

"Right noble and most worthy <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, you are welome vnto this my country, for by your comming I haue bene more at my hearts ease then during my lyfe I haue ben, and many yeares past haue I longed for your presence. For although I knew for a certeinty that hether you should come, yet the time when, I knew not, which hath hetherto bene concealed from mortall men, and only made knowne to God himselfe. I knewe lykewyse so soone as my daughter <name rend="roman">Calinda</name> was borne, that she should be sette frée from cruell captiuitie and perpetual dishonor by you onely, but the matter howe, was not reuealed withall, onely that it should be when the prouidence of God directed by his wyll, committed the execution thereof to Fortune. Thus may we men for all our cunninge neither alter the course of things appoynted by destenye, nor yet finde other remedy then is permitted by the foreknowledge of God. As this my daughter coulde neuer haue bene saued but onely in that same manner as you gaue hir succour. The reason was, bicause my knowledge coulde not wade so déepe as to forsée euery thinge concluded by destenyes, the selfe same thing being subiect vnder the ly<unclear>n</unclear>e of destenye, that I should not perceiue it. So my daughter went on lande vnto the Gyants Iland, which I neither foresawe to preuent, nor could haue preuented if I had forséene. Yet that which was in my power I so ruled the boate that it came to your shippe, thereby to haue reliefe at your hands for my care. This haue I tolde you at large the inhabilitie of our cunninge against the influence of y^e stars, wherby you may perceiue how much I am beholding vnto you, the rather to make bolde vppon my seruice, if in any respect either my Art or my armour may doe you pleasure."</p><p><name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> attentiuely lystening vnto the wise mans discourse, in the ende gaue him great thanckes for his so lyberall offer, promising lykewise the seruice of his body, for other thing had he nought, to do his commaund in any

But here he abode ij. daies with <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name>, serued of delicate viandes and strange deuises, able to quicken a dead mans stomacke, béeing héere better pleased with his entertainment then he was euer otherwise. One day sittinge at the boarde with <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, the wise man espying hym ouccupyed in his thought about hys iourney to <name rend="roman">England</name>, sported wyth him in this sorte. "<name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, I sée wel this coūtrey bréedeth not such things as may content your appetie, and I holde you excused, for your desire coueteth after <name rend="roman">Mars</name> and Martiall feates, wherefore as my learning sheweth me, your lust carrieth your stomacke into <name rend="roman">England</name>, ther to be knighted.

Ryght honourable Syr, séeinge you haue entered into thys discourse, I praye you continue it, for I knewe naught as pertayning to this my brother, saue that he was loste in the Sea béeing very younge, and I haue hitherto thought that hée had bene deade, and sith nothing is hid from your knowledge, I pray you likewise satisfie me in y^e same manner as concerninge the Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> my Father, that I maye séeke hym if there bée hope of findinge on this earth. Most noble Prince aunswered the wyse man, you drawe me vnto a longe tale, and in some poynt nothinge pertinent to you. But knowe for a truth that the gentleman of the Sunne your brother is aliue already knighted, and for hys first prises he hath achyued suche meruaylous déedes of armes, as that it standeth you in hande to besturre your selfe if you mynde to be matchable, béeinge the onely man as yet vnparagonized through the worlde. Hée is nowe in a countrey where wythout knowledge of hys estate, he is notwithstandinge muche praysed for his personage, the regyon so farre dystant from thys our clymate, that if you put your selfe on the waye to séeke hym, your payne shoulde bee infinite and as I can learne néedelesse, for ere that you passe our of thys countrey hée wyll come to séeke you heere. Nowe as to your demaunde touching the Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> whome you call you Father. I doe you to wytte that hée was deade before that you were begotten, and that the royall Princesse your mother nowe destitute of an husbande, shall in tyme recouer hir lawefull husbande, and you shall knowe your Father, for the greatest and mightiest Prince christened. Furthermore bycause it is forbidden mée to discouer of the greate secretes of

God, vntyll it be his pleasure that all men shall knowe it, I maye not aunswere you, but the euente shall witnesse wyth my prophecie." Nowe wyll I make ready for your passage into <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>, for there muste bée shewed the first flowre of your manhood. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> was greatly confused in his vnderstāding, at the words which y^e wyse man spake béeing yet plaine &amp; easy, and he able to make English of euery woorde, but the cause was, for that he was vnable to finde out y^e true sence which this diuinitie carried, béeing repugnannt to hys former beléefe. So hacking and gessinge about it to make lykelihoodes of impossibilities, and examining euery point by it selfe, yet coulde he neuer bee setled nor make good construction of it. For his mother tolde hym that prince <name rend="roman">Edwarde</name> was his Father. The wise man deliuered the contrary. And if his Mother knewe his Father, then howe coulde his Father be dead ere he was begotten, and howe coulde his mother recouer hir lawefull husband béeinge dead, and howe coulde his father become such a monarch after his discease, and so foorth. Nowe if he gaue credit to the wise man, yet no man better knoweth the childes father then the mother. So that for reuerence of the wyse man, and to reconcile hys mothers woordes with the wise mans réede, he framed to hymselfe for that time a newe article of beliefe that one thinge myght be, and not bee. Yet time founde out a better solution of this sophisme. For thys time seeing it was no reason to importunate the wyse man vppon this matter, it contented hym to knowe for a truth that <name rend="roman">Donzel del Febo</name> his brother was yet alyue, and hee gaue hym hartye thanckes for the courtesie hee had shewed hym heerein. But for his voyage into <name rend="roman">Englande</name>, hee lefte that to hys direction, sith hee perceiued his meaning therein.

The armour was framed so cunningly, as for workmanshippe, cost, and secret vertue, it excelled all that I haue séene. It was closely wrought, couriously engrauen, enchased with precious stones, and aboue all this efficacie, that it resisted the edge of all mettall, this effect procéeding either form the stones, or the examination of the ascendentes in the forginge thereoff.

Now that y^t especially drew yoūg princes &amp; men of great name thether, was this. The king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> had a

daughter named <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> the onely enheritrix of his kingdome, of y^e age of xiiij. yeares, a beautifull &amp; delicate damsel, as not hir lyke might be found in all y^e quarters. For y^e fame of hir singuler beautie, thether came many noble princes &amp; worthy knights to win hir liking, each of them wearing so rich and quaint deuises, that their brauery in short time exiled the longe mourning which had continued in great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>. The myrth which they made, much delighted the king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name>, and it ioyed hym much to see hys courte and countrey so well stored of knyghtes and Princes to whome hee gaue honourable entertainment and countenaunce of good wyll, as well of his owne subiectes as straungers, and all were well content with all highly commending of his courte, for magnificence and courtisie. The kinge at thys time was a wyddower, and therfore he sought much the honour of the Princesse his daughter. But to come to our matter amongst y^e knights straungers: The two Princes <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Lyriamandro</name> bare the greatest stroke: next <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Lusitania</name> a younge knyght and valiant in armes, already enamored vppon the fayre princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, for whom he had bene a longe time suter in the kinges pallayce, presuming vpon his byrth &amp; liuelihood that she should be graunted vnto him, &amp; as it fell out y^e princesse vnderstood some part of his desire, but she was of an hautie heart and hyghe minde, makinge no more account of <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> in respect of that demaund, then of an other ordinary knight, or the refuse of other. For amongest all which were already come, she thought none merited to be a péere and match for hir beautie, béeing (as my authoour saith, such in his owne conceite as if no Prince were worthy of it). But the truth is that y^e blinde boy shooting at random had ouerreached his marke as appeared in the second shot at the comming in of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. In y^e third place there came into this triumph the Prince of <name rend="roman">Ireland</name> called <name rend="roman">Argiles</name>, &amp; <name rend="roman">Don Orgiles</name> prince of <name rend="roman">Scot-</name><pb n="166" ed="digital" entity="13801:66" pages="84"/><milestone n="[84L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><name rend="roman">land</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Allamades</name> king of <name rend="roman">Cornewaile</name>, all thrée vassals &amp; subiectes to y^e king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name>. The fourth roome was assigned to <name rend="roman">Don Brynco</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Numidio</name> in <name rend="roman">Africk</name> bringing frō his countrey many valiant knights richly armed, &amp; with thē <name rend="roman">Albalaxes</name> king of <name rend="roman">Mauritania</name> a <name rend="roman">Pagan</name> yoūg &amp; lusty. Ther came thether also two gyants of an admirable height &amp; fiercenes, being such a terrour to y^e poore cō<unclear>m</unclear>inalty enhabiting y^e villages nere to <name rend="roman">London</name>, y^t the poore mans feare made them the more insolent to commit diuers ryots and other trespasses before the feastes began. This was the seuerall countenaunces of the knyghtes of most account, but to make short, there came besides many other knighes both <name rend="roman">Christians</name> and <name rend="roman">Pagans</name> vnder the kings writ of safeconduct whiche himselfe gaue out. That neuer <name rend="roman">England</name> more flourished of knightes, nor neuer nation was lyke to <name rend="roman">England</name>. But nowe the first daye of the iustes before they should ryde to the tylte, the kinge <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> inuited all the kinges and Princes to dinner in his pallaice, where they were feasted royally and with great melody. After the tables taken vp, the knyghtes went to arme themselues, and the kinge conducted by the auncient Lordes and Barons of hys court tooke vp his seate in a windowe ouer the tiltyarde, and vppon a scaffolde before him reared for that prupose, he commaunded the prices to bée put, whiche were dyuers, for vnto the crowne before spoken off, hee added a choller of lyke valure, and many other iewels able, for the honour of atteininge them and the worthinesse thereoff, to animate a dastard knyght to such an enterprise. After this the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> comming foorth of the great pallaice with an 100. ladies and gentlewomen mounted vpon a stately scaffolde very richly hanged. Among these Ladyes ther was y^e princesse <name rend="roman">Siluerina</name> daughter to the king of <name rend="roman">Scotland</name>, &amp; <name rend="roman">Rodosylua</name> princesse of <name rend="roman">Lusitania</name> sister to <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name>, and many other Ladyes and daughters vnto the great Lordes of <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>.</p><pb n="167" ed="digital" entity="13801:66" pages="84"/><milestone n="84     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><p>But in the middest of these the fayre Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> shewed not lesse maiesty then the fresh and fragrant rose doth among the briers and stinking nettles, which notwithstanding haue their commendation for their gréene and liuely verdure. But the scaffolde béeing filde with ladyes and gentlewomen, there came the knights in place, most of them young and shining in their bright armour. The first that pricked himselfe forwarde to iuste ws <name rend="roman">Allamades</name> king of <name rend="roman">Cornewaile</name>, a very good &amp; tried knight, against whome there came to encounter an other abled knight an <name rend="roman">Almaine</name> set vpon a strong courser. In theyr shocke their speares flew in shiuers, &amp; the king <name rend="roman">Allamades</name> somewhat staggering in his saddle vnhorsed y^e <name rend="roman">Almaine</name>, after him there came .x. other knights straungers more bolde then skilfull in feates of armes, all whiche the valyant <name rend="roman">Allamades</name> ouerthrewe, with great pleasure to the kynge and all his court. Then the kinge called for hys knightes, with this <name rend="roman">Allamades</name> to gyue them place voyded the lystes, and there entered <name rend="roman">Argiles</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Ireland</name>, which with eyght seuerall courses brake eyght speares, and ouerthrewe eyght knyghtes. After hym <name rend="roman">Don Orgiles</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Scotland</name> came, whom when <name rend="roman">Argiles</name> espyed, not mindinge to disturbe hym, hée rode vnto the lystes ende, <name rend="roman">Orgiles</name> wythout béeinge moued in hys saddle cast downe twelue knyghtes, and then followed hys fellowe <name rend="roman">Argiles</name>. By and by <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> came in wyth a guilte armour gorgious to beholde, and his horse barbed wyth clothe of golde cutte vppon siluer Imagerie, béeinge a lustye and valiaunte Knyght, and as the thoughtes of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> emboldened his courage, so besides the hautinesse of hys stomack contemned all other knightes in respect of hymselfe. In his iourney he dismounted xx. knights within less then halfe an houre, so that many thought he would wyn the honour of that day. But straight waye there preased forwarde the two Princes <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name>,

hauing in their company more then 200. knightes, wyth their haraldes crying before them, <name rend="roman">Bohemia</name>, <name rend="roman">Bohemia</name>, <name rend="roman">Hungaria</name>, <name rend="roman">Hungaria</name>. The two Princes rode vpon fayre and strong coursers, richly armed as became their estates, their lustinesse béeinge enflamed by their loues, for since their comming to the English court, they were esprysed with loue. <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Syluerina</name>, and <name rend="roman">Lyriamandro</name> of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Rodasylua</name>, and hauinge obteined the good fauoures of their Ladyes, they payned themselues to be as boulde as the brauest. So findinge the tylt emptie by <name rend="roman">Siluerios</name> departing, they praunced forwarde till other knightes came agaynst them. And eyther of them in their turnes, before they left the liftes, ouerthrew at the least 30. knights a péece, so blasing their prowesse by the force they shewed, that the kynge and other beholders chaunged their opinion as touchinge <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name>. Upon this the two Princes glad of that dayes trauayle, and vaunting themselues before their mystresses made roome for other to doe their endeuoures. After these the valiant and hardy knightes of the Englyshe court came in against the straungers of other countries, where the Englysh men so behaued themselues as that dayes honour was theirs. Nowe as the kinge was in talke wyth his Lordes aboute the glorye whiche hys men had gotten, and euery man was attentiue to that which was before hym. Sodeinly there was hearde a great crye amongest the people on the backe side of the lists, no man knowing what it meant. By and by there came foorth a tall Gyant wyth a traine of more then xx. knightes vpon a stone horse which groned in a manner vnder his weight. The Gyant commaundinge his knightes to stande a side, went alone to the windowe where the king was, there raysing vp his beueare and forcing out a terrible looke, without other reuerence, hée spake on this wise. "King <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> I am <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name>, Lorde of the Ilandes <name rend="roman">Baleance</name>, and am hether come bi-

cause of the prices which thou haste appointed for the best dooers, I am well knowne in all the heathen countrey, for by the power which my Gods haue emparted with me, there is no mortall man that may gaynstande my puissance, and for that this day thou shalt haue some triall of this truth, beholde before the night be shutte in, there shall no knight of all these which are héere kéepe his saddell, vnlesse he kéepe himselfe from me." And so in great pride, as you may presume by y^e course of his speach he vttered this, and pulled downe his visoure. Then with a great speare in his hand, he tooke the one ende of the payle. This his comming was nothing pleasaunt to the king, for since his arriuall in that kingdome, hee had done many outrages to the poore subiects of the land. And the king feared least the knights of his courte, should not be be able to maintaine their honour againste him. Nowe this monstrous Gyant had not stayed there long, but that a valyant knight a <name rend="roman">Britaine</name> called <name rend="roman">Brandaristes</name> made a signe vnto him.</p><p>These two ranne together, and in their shocke <name rend="roman">Brandaristes</name> with his horse fell to grounde: but the Gyant nothing diseased, held on his way toward an other knight by name <name rend="roman">Brandidarte</name>, a <name rend="roman">Britaine</name> to, a braue knighte and as bolde as <name rend="roman">Gawayne</name>, but the Gyant welcommed him lyke as the other, and thus in shorte time the Gyant prouing himselfe vpon more then an 100 knights of the hardyest both straungers and Englishmen, he made them all to descende from their horses, that the kinge <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> was much disquyeted hereat, &amp; wold haue bought out the Gyāts presēce if he might, for more <sic>th</sic><name rend="roman">London</name> is worth euer for y^e pitie which he had vpon his knights, not possibly able to withstande this Gyant. The <sic>king</sic><name rend="roman">Allamades</name> beholding the kings countenaunce sadde and gessing the cause, woulde needes aduenture the honoure which hee before gayned vpon the vanquish of such a Gyant, and taking a fresh horse with a choyse speare from the ratler

he rode to <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> whome the Gyant mette so forcibly that <name rend="roman">Allamedes</name> lay on the ground, and <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> dressing <sic>himsefe</sic> in his saddle passed on. By and by <name rend="roman">Orgiles</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Ireland</name> sette vppon the Gyant, which somewhat estonished him: but neuertheles <name rend="roman">Orgiles</name> happe for himselfe was in no other manner then his fellowes. Then came in done <name rend="roman">Don Argiles</name> to take <name rend="roman">Orgiles</name> parte, and fiercely encountred the Gyant, but to y^e same purpose. Now was <name rend="roman">Don Syluerio</name> ashamed before the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> to haue taryed behinde so many good knights, and therefore forcing his courage to please his Lady vppon a lyght courser he ranne against <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name>, &amp; his Fortune was so good that he made <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> to lose one of his stirops and the raynes of his bridell, but <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> quitted this with more then a tollerable vsury, for he carried him beyond y^e crouper almost a speares length, which disgrace before his Lady <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> made him woode angry, and willyngly would he haue challenged the combat, if both leysure and place had bene conuenient. Not long after the Prince <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> gathering his forces at the beholding of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Syluerina</name> went to encounter the Gyant, either of them being well heated, but diuersly, as arising of diuers causes, but their strengthes encreased by their heates, made their shocks to terrible as neither parte had great aduantage. The Gyant fell vpon the crouper of his horse and rode the length of a caryer ere he might arise agayn. <name>Bargandel</name> fel to the ground with his horse vnder him. Thus made him hange his heade, and styred vp his friend <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> for his succours, who caused <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> to embrace the saddell bowe, himselfe being cleane lyfte out of the saddell by <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> the Gyant, and <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> laye on the grounde to complaine him of his mishappe before his mistres <name rend="roman">Rodasylua</name>. After these ther was none left so hardy, as to dare encounter <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name>, which caused y^e king and other Princes to looke rufully, &amp; the Gyant to beare

himselfe as insolently, for when there was none lefte he lyfte vp his voyce in these termes. "Come forthe, come forthe, ye knights of the <sic>hreat</sic><name rend="roman">Britaine</name>, &amp; either knowe what the force of <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> is, or if you dare not appeare, sende me the prices presently, for to none of the worlde thy doe so rightly apperteyne as to me," and this saying, he gallopped vp and downe in the place, expecting either some knight or the prices. The king seing none come to aunswere his challenge was verye angrye and would haue giuen his best town to haue had a knight which coulde haue quayled the Gyants courage, and for very griefe he tourned himselfe from the windowe, tyll the sodayne shoote of the people, caused him to looke out agayne.</p><p>Then he espyed the people flocking together towards one corner of the lyste, and in the midst of them an aged man with a long white bearde riding softly on a Mule, and bearing the countenaunce of a very wise man. After him he sawe a knight well harnessed in white armour, richly besette with precious stones so that no man in the place had the lyke, his helmette had a fine plume and his horse the lyke, the pomell of his saddell of Goldesmithes caruing, and the seate all embrodered with golde and siluer. Euery thing belonging to the knighte so braue and lustye, that none nowe but gazed on the straunger. After him a good distaunce there rode a gentlewoman an easye pace vppon a palfraye driuing before hir a sumptuous horse.</p><p>The gentlewoman comminge néere vnto the pallaice alyghted, and vnlacing hir male, spredde a faire tente in the playne, made all of clothe of golde, with suche straunge deuises, that neyther kynge nor keysar in the worlde but myghte haue vouchsafed it for hymselfe. But that whiche was most commendable, was the most excelent and braue conceits with néedeleworke which could neuer haue bene wrought but by an exquisite

semster, as in déede y^e wise <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> was the workeman. Now to make short worke, when the pauilion was pyghte, <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> leading <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with him vnto the king, spake on this wise.</p><p>"God encrease thy royall estate king of the great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>, &amp; aduaunce the credite of thy whole courte. Whitte you most puyssaunt Prince, that from mine Ilande I am hether come with this young gentleman, that he may be knighted by your owne hands. And albeit y^t so greate a courtesie neither he nor I haue merited of your maiestie, yet vnderstande worthy king that for his lygnage hée is such a one as not without reson he may craue to be dubbed knight of so mightie a Prince as you are. And I dare warrant moreouer that it shall not be yll bestowed on him, as your selfe shall testefie in shorte time, althoughe you shall not throughlye enter into the consideration of his valour, til that his death be publyshed by reporte of his drowninge, and that much bloode shalbee spilt to the greater prayse of his prowesse, to the contentacion of your preson, and to the profite of your royall estate, and bée it my tale séeme incredible yet I beséech you to remember it well, for I wil auouch y^e euent as I haue told you. Retayne him therefore sir king in your courte, and beleue that the time shall come wherin you woulde lose the best part of your kingdome to haue him néere you. But to the ende, this story now auerred by mee, maye carrye more authoritie with your worthy person. Knowe that this reporter is <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> of whose knoweledge you haue hearde before. For with my skill I haue done seruice to such great Lords as you are. <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> heere making a reasonable pawse, beganne agayne on this wyse. Syr king with your maiestyes leaue, we haue heare pitched a tent in the name of the gentleman, as a challenge against all commers after you haue made him knighte. <sic>t</sic>he first which shall vnhorse him, shall enioy this tente, the value wherof may content him for his iourney," and

héere staying he sayd. Sir king I haue done. King <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> all this while not lending his eares idelly, as to a fable in a wynter nighte, but waying euery point, looked vppon <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, and well thoughte that his personage might agrée with <name rend="roman">Artemidoros</name> commendacion, but yet as halfe in a doubt as touching himselfe he made y^e wise man this aunswere. "Assuredly <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> with this demaund or any other which you shall require, I am verye glad that you take occasion of comming to my court, for by the brute of your fame, I haue long time wished to se you: but to sende for you in déede, I was neuer minded, bicause as I hear, against your wil no man may speke with you. And to make you answer, I am in purpose to satisfie you, aswell for your owne sake, as for this gentlemans, whose behauiour séemeth to be such, as w^tout your report he cōmeth sufficiently cōmended vnto me. I promise you héere to make him knighte with mine owne handes, &amp; I beséech God he proue no worse then you foreshew mée." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and the wise man bothe bowed humblye on their horsebacks.</p><p>The king badde <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to alyght, which dismounting from his horse ascended by a payre of stayres to a little scaffolde before the kings windowe, where knéeling downe in the sight of the whole multitude, he receiued the order of knighthood at the kings hands. The king demaunded wher the young knight should receiue y^e sword, and the wise man aunswered that he should staye for that till he could conquer it. Then after the duetie done to the king, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> retourned to horsebacke, and wyth a lyuelye grace so demeaned himselfe uppon him horse, as that it well pleased the beholders. Now for that which followeth you must entend that the wise man vttered his speaches to the king in the audience of the whole multitude, many knyghtes and other compassing him about to heare his arraunt, so that fewe or none but were partakers of it. Amongst them as <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> bea-

ring himselfe within the lystes as proudly, as the Cocke of the game doth in the Cockepit when the crauen is chased. Then hearing that the tent was put for a rewarde to him which coulde vnhorse the young knight, when he saw time he cryed aloude to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> saying. "In good faith new knight thou bewrayest thy folly and lacke of experiance, when thou sawest me stand in this place with my speare in my hande to make that challenge, which shall not be in thy power to maintayne so surely, but that I wilbe the mayster of thy pauilyon, &amp; yet Gods blessing on thy heart for bringing so fayre a Jewell being in déed fitter for me then for thée. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> whose courage neuer taynted, aunswered as shortly. It shalbe thine Gyant if thou winnest it, and there shall no man forbid thée the possession of it if thou ouerthrowe me." And without more wordes he tooke a great speare from the ratler, and tourning his horse heade he rode softly to the place wher the iustes were kept. In hys way thether, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> lyfting vp his eyes to the scaffolde of the gentlewomen, he sawe the beautifull <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> standing directly agaynst his face, excéeding no lesse the other gentlewomen in brightnesse then the Moone excelleth the starres in a frosty night. O poore <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> what a looke was that which locked thée from thy rest, for with hir beautie thou wast wounded at the heart, that albeit in time the skinne euergrew it and the flesh healed, yet the skarre remayned: &amp; neuer knight in the worlde loued more loyally then thou didst. For though the sight was short and the blowe quicke, yet the wounde was déepe and the smart cureles. O full many a bolde enterprice diddest thou achieue ere thou gaynedst a reasonable guerdon for thy greate good will. And thou faire Princesse, being within the hearing of the wise mans speach, diddest not spare to lende thine eares to an other mans tale, and thine eyes to an other mans brauerye, that thy succours being farre from thée, they hearte had not the power to repulse thy aduersarye, loue being the

onely occasion of thy vnrest. But Lorde what alteracion both of you felte by the enterchange of your lookes, which serued lykewise for messengers to tell your tales betwixt you.</p><p>And yet I cannot déeme but that this loue so enraged his courage against <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> as otherwise I maye thincke he had not done so well. But comming into the place, hee addressed himselfe towardes <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name>, both of them now being in a readinesse.

Not longe after the trumpettes blowed the retreate, and the iustes shoulde haue ended when these two knightes entered wyth yelowe plumes and guylded armour, their horse trappings al of yelowe, &amp; parting company, the one of them ranne against <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, whom he mette so strongly that their speares flewe in péeces, neither of them béeing vnhorsed, whereat all the people were dismayde, for no knight that daye but was ouerthrowne of as many as <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had encountred.

ouerthrew foure others that there was not a knight left to dare him, at this time he tarried sometime awaiting for newe commers in, but there was none. Onely at a corner of the listes, he sawe a huge Gyant in white armour vpon a great courser, wiht a hoarce and disdainful voice, commaunding the people to make him roome. And not farre from this gyant a gentlewoman vpon a palfray in straunge attire much different from ours, hir face was all bedewed with teares as if the gyant had vsed violēce towards hir. The gyant approaching to the place where the kinge stoode, made no reuerence, but the gentlewoman knéeled downe, saying. "Know most excellent Prince that the renowne of this court hath brought me from far countries hether, chiefly for one cause, which the wickednesse of this gyant hath nowe made two, the originall of them both you shall héere nowe vnder one. In the farther part of the East néere vnto the great <name rend="roman">Cataya</name>, there gouerneth a Princesse named <name rend="roman">Iulia</name>, as yet but young of yeares, but not younge for handsomnesse, béeing now as it were in the pride of all hir beautie. Hir father was a right cunning Magician enstructing hir so perfectly in his skill, as nowe therein there are fewe comparable. For since his death, she hir self diuined by hir knowledge that she shoulde be prisoner to two gyants, and shoulde be inlarged by one knight which should fight with them both. For the case should stand thus, that if hir knight were vanquished she should as perpetually captiuate be at their commaund, otherwise to be at libertie if they were yelden. Hir selfe foreseeing this, and not finding who he might be, hath prouided by hir knowledge not to bée beguilded. For by hir Arte she hath made this swoorde, which no knight may euer vnsheth, but onely he whiche must fight wyth the two gyants for hir libertie, and besides the swoorde is such as without it, it were a hard aduenture, but wyth it the knight maye boldely venture on his foes.

close till time these two Gyantes by night assailing hir, got the Lordshippe of hir person, after which time by a trustie seruaunt she caused this swoorde to be conuayed vnto me with thys commaunde to trauaile for hys sake in all Princes courtes, and to seeke out the knight which could and should maynteine hir quarell. Three yeares are passed since I vndertooke this enterprise, and within this thrée monthes landing in an Iland towardes the West, after a longe iourney to no purpose it was my fortune to méete this gyant <name rend="roman">Candramaite</name>, there makinge him pertaker of my sute, hee requested to proue the aduenture, which I graunted, but when he could not draue it out beeinge couetous of the swoorde, he denyed it mee agayne, saying. For so much as you goe to the kynge of <name rend="roman">Englands</name> courte, there to seeke some knyghte whiche wyll doe his deuoure in your mistresse behalfe. No man shall attempt the aduenture of the swoorde, but he shall first trye his forces vpon mee, and if by hym I be vanquished or slaine, let him take the swoord, otherwise I will withholde it from all men, with this he promised to beare me company, and I of two euils determined to choose the lesse. Albeit at this instant I am in greater extremitie, by reason of this Gyants wrong done to me, and my mistresse thraldome. This is the necessitie whiche draue me hether, and I am humbly to beseeche your maiestie, discretly to way my cause, and to giue remedy by your subiectes as you beste may." <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> all this time standinge by, in the ende auerred hir tale to be true, and farther intimated to the Knightes and Princes that seeing he coulde not drawe out the swoorde, there shoudl no man be master of it, but by the mastery of him: but sayth he, I will defende it against any knyght which shal demaund it. All the knights beheld the swoord with the rich hangers as the fairest which they had séene, but the kinge somewhat angry at the Gyants rudenesse towardes the gentlewoman, sayd to him in this manner.

"<name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> thou hast done ill to take this swoorde from the gentlewoman, for as it seemes <name rend="roman">Iulia</name> made it not for thee, &amp; thy pride is ouer great to suppose that none in the worlde will demaunde it of thee.  The Gyant angerly lookinge vpon the king as though his eyen would haue flyen out of his visage, said to the king Demaund it then thy selfe Syr king, or set any of thy knightes to aske it, &amp; I will then make aunswere vnto thee howe rashly thou hast taken vpon thee to correct me." These speaches were deliuered with so high a voyce by the Gyant, that all the knyghtes whiche were in the compasse hearde it, but no man spake a woorde, so that the kynges choller encreased both agaynst the Gyant and his owne subiectes. And I must beare with them, for the Gyant was great and tall, and as hardye as a Lyon, and no man liuinge very neere matchable for so good Fortune: but yet there was within the lystes both a hardier and more fortunate knight, euen the good <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, which euer hearing his vndiscrete talke vnto the kinge, comminge neere vnto the Gyant, tooke him vp on this sorte. "<name rend="roman">Candramarte</name>, content thy selfe, and learne to knowe vnto whom thou speakest, for I tell thee that kinge <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> hath suche knyghtes in his court as can make thee amende thy rusticitie, though thou went more vntaught then thou art, and for that thou shalt not mistrust mee, beholde I am the last and the least of them yet as one whiche desires to serue hym with the moste. In hys name, and in behalfe of the gentlewoman, I charge thée surrender the swoorde vnto the gentlewoman, or if thou wilt not that, do thou take that parte of the field which shall best lyke thee, for in thys quarrell I wyll eyther kyll or bee kylled.

foolish knight thou hast not ben long acquainted with the burthen of armour, for if thou wert in thy kinde and had well wayed the successe of Combatons thou wouldest shake euery ioynt of thée to beholde mée. But thy ignoraunce makes thée leape beyond thy lashe, and thrusteth thée forward to thine owne decay. But séeing thou hast made choyse thy selfe of thy deathsman, let vs go to the battaile, for I woulde not but that thou shouldest repent thée of thy foolishnesse. So <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> broched his horse with the spurres, and <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> did the lyke, whiche appeased the kinges displeasure, that he knewe not how to recōpence his forwardnesse in doing him pleasure, albeit it may be if he loued <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, y^t he somwhat mistrusted the euent bicause the gyant was byg and <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> vnexercised in armes, and that which was chiefest without a swoorde, but for remedy thereto, he caused a swoorde of his owne to be fetched, wherewith he charged a knight to deliuer it to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, with his commaundemēt. That séeing in his name he hath so well fitted <name rend="roman">Candromarte</name> for his aunswere, and for that cause was to take the battayle vpon him, nowe hee prayed him to weare thys swoorde lykewyse for his sake, whiche he would warrant to be good. The knight dyd his message accordingly, but <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> making his excuse gentely, retourned y^e swoord with this aunswere, "I humbly thancke the kinges maiestie for so high a present, the not receiuinge whereoff commeth not of any refusal but by a promise which I haue made, as his maiestie can testifie, neuer to weare sword, but if I winne it, &amp; therfore I craue pardon at his maiesties handes for his discourtesie, otherwyse I were greatly to blame if I thought not my selfe honoured by beeing girte in a kinges weapon." The messenger deliuered <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> aunswere in the same woordes as <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had giuen it out so the kinge somewhat lamenting the knightes wilfulnesse, as he thought, weaponlesse to wage battayle with so abled a warriour, mused vppon

As the one gaue lyghtly so the other pursued as eagerlye, but as I saye neuer fastening a ryghte downe blowe, but as he might ouerthwart and endelong slipping his blowes, and in his pride boasting out these and such lyke speaches.</p><p>"O knight howe costlye shall the challenge of Quéene <name rend="roman">Iulias</name> sworde be vnto thee, if for it thou must exchaunge thy lyfe? Haddest thou not ben better neuer to haue bene at this marte. But now know what valour <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> is off, for not all the worlde are of that credite with mee as to bayle thée out of my handes." For the fitting of hys action wherevnto he woulde shake hys heauy Fawlchon so gallantly, and roare so terribly: that euery man tooke <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name>, rather for a Tyrant in the Tragedie, then a Jester in a Commedie. And <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> friendes with their pitifull lookes bemoned the poore <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, as if he had already tasted of most cruell and bitter deathe in his gréene youth<sic/></p><p>Amongst them, the fayre and beautifull Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> although as yet altogether vnacquaynted with <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, was a spectatour, neither carelesse nor curicus, but as one without hope. She onely wished well to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, whose bruses were as deepe set in his sides, as they were imprinted in <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> fleshe, and euery wagging of the most huge and monstrious <name rend="roman">Candramartes</name> weapon, strake a salte teare from hir faire eyes, so was she estranged from hir self &amp; altogether become an other mans: the newe knight eying his mistresse became so desperate that

he fully resolued either to close with <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> and wring his weapon from him, or to dye vpon him. And watching the opportunitie, when the fawchon was ouer the Gyants head, bending his body stept within the Gyant, y^t the Gyant had no other resistance but to fel him to the grounde with his elbowes. This was no great misfortune to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, for albeit he was fayne to bowe his knées by the thrust of the Gyants elbowes, yet couching his bodye closely, his chaunce was so good as to fasten vpon the hilts of Quéene <name rend="roman">Iulias</name> sworde, which hee drewe out, the scaberde remayning at the Gyants side. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> nowe being seased of the sword stepte from <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> and called vppon him on this wise. "<name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> nowe thou shalte see who shall haue the worste bargayne of Quéene <name rend="roman">Iulias</name> sworde, sith on euen hands we shall try this combat," and with this remembring the Gyants former pride, he layed at the Gyant so thick and so sure that in short space the blood ranne from the Gyante in more then tenne places, for the sworde was excéeding sharpe, and <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> as fell and venemous. Nowe maye you thincke that the mayden seeing the sworde bared by the knight, was the gladdest woman in the earth, and that the king with other Princes and knights thancked God hartely, for prouiding <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> of a weapon the sooner to put ende to the battayle. But the Gyant assaulted so sore by <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and wounded so daungerously, began wholy to mistrust the prophecie of the sworde, and to dispayre of the victory, and as in such cases wanhoope is aduenturous: so his armour being rente, the <unclear>habergeen</unclear><unclear>vnm</unclear>ayled, and all the riuetting out of order, for that cause the Gyant woulde needes put the tryall of the challenge vpon one blowe. When this blowe was reached as farre as the Gyant might, to haue descended with more vyolence vppon <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> headpéece, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> beinge more quicke then hee, mette the blowe crossewayes that he cut off both the Gyants armes harde by the elbowes. The

Gyant thus maymed, yelling out a lothesome cry, reuyled &amp; railed on <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, as a man distraught, &amp; y^t which most encreased his payn, was not y^e tormēt of his disfigured armes: but either the shame of the victory, or the enuy at <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, but <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> making little account of him, tooke the scabberde from his side, and so lefte him. <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> still followed blaspheming and cursing both God and men, and when he coulde neither be his owne executioner, nor procure an other to take the paynes, sware, that for sparing his death, he would deuise all the mischiefe that might against <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and that he woulde practise his death also, if possibly he could inuēt y^e meanes. But truly, if I had bene in <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> case, I should not haue bene so straunge: seing, that bothe it shoulde haue bene the Gyants last request and so little encombraunce towardes me. But the king, Princes and knights, were so ioyous of the victory agaynst the Gyant, as they bare countenaunce of more ioy outwardly, then they had earst receyued, euery one openly desiring to sée him vnarmed: but chiefly <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name>, bring in some ielousie of y^e knight, whom they had found a friend ere they looked for, supposing that peraduenture he was <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, of whom the soddayne aduenture in the Sea had berefte them. And Quéene <name rend="roman">Iulias</name> gentlewoman seing the combat tryed and the aduenture of the sworde achieued, concluding therby that this was he for whom she had made so long a iourney, saluted him courteously with this ambassade. "Now that it is euident noble knight, that you are the person, for whose helpe this sworde was framed by my mistresse, I am to certefie that my Lady greeteth you by me, &amp; giueth you warninge that for hir sake you must maintain y^e fight wiht two braue Gyants, iointly cōbattant against you only. For this she hath sent you this sworde y^e commēdacion wherof, albeit not vnknown, lyeth in the continuall proofe which shee requesteth you neuer to forsake, for it wil much furder you in your enterprises.

Whereto I bessech you giue credite &amp; deale effectually as she hath hope in you. But now giue me the sword that I may beare it to the king and the other Princes, that they may iustifie the truth of my former au<unclear>oue</unclear>h." So <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> delyuered the sworde into hir handes with the sheath, which the gentlewoman brought before the king and the knights then present, which all attempted the pulling out but coulde not doe it, as if the scabberde had bene a peece of the same mettall whereof the sworde was, and not seuered by edge or toole, which made them all confesse, that to the new knight it was proposed, and to hym appertayned the fight with the two Gyants for the franchising of the Quéene <name rend="roman">Iulia</name>.</p><p>The king redelyuered the sworde into the gentlewomans handes, and bad hir yeelde it againe to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, which she did, &amp; taking hir leaue of him receiued this for answer. That he recōmēded himselfe vnto hir good grace, hartely thanking hir for so great care ouer him, as to prouide a sworde, whereof he had néede as hir selfe can witnesse, and for the rest hee promised not to fayle hir as hee was true knight to God and the worlde. The gentlewoman with this recommaunde gallopped awaye as fast as hir palfray mighte carry hir, the whilest <name rend="roman">Candramartes</name> knights remoued their Lorde out of that place into hys tent, whence afterwarde with greate griefe for his sore mayme they conuayed him into his Ilande, wherein hauing settled himselfe as mindfull of his othe, he neuer left from immagening of crafty meanes, and coyning newe pollicies to bring <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to the death.</p><p>When <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> was carryed into his tent, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> mounting vpon his horse, tooke a great speare in his hande and stode at the lystes ende, thincking that some knight would come against him, but they were all so scholed with the sight of this last victorye that neuer a knight shewed himselfe. Wherefore the king commaunded to sounde the trumpet to procéede vnto the disposing of the

rewardes for their trauayle. An Heralde demaunding aloude who had done best, they all referred the prices to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. The king woulde not contende with them, but sayth heée, I will that my daughter haue the bestowing of them where shée best lyketh as touching this tournaye.</p><p>She with much shamefastenesse which hir coloured cheekes bewrayed, accepted the charge, and taking the crowne with the choller in hir hande, she caused the new knighte to be called before hir, who burning in loue towardes hir, no lesse then shee was seruent in lyking towards him, dismounted at the first call, and betweene the two Princes <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> mounted vp the scaffolde where the beautifull Princesse was, before whom he appeared with greater feare arising of his conceit concerning his indignitie, then earst attached him in the fight with <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> without a weapon.</p><p>The two Princes comming before <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, made their humble obeysaunce, and <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> knéeled downe. The Princesse with a good grace bending to euery one of them spake to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. "You knowe new knight what charge the king my father hath layde vppon mée, athough farre more honourable then I am able to sustayne, yet by mee assumed, neither to resist his will nor yet agaynst my desire, for it is cōmendable of it selfe to be a commender of vertue, &amp; neuer to much may I commend it. The charge is, that wyth mine owne handes I shoulde distribute these prices accordinge as my own fancie leadeth mee to deeme of euery mans trauayle and valyauncye. The delyuerye of these Jewelles, were nothing harde nor doubtefull, but the disposing is more then harde, bicause it pertayneth to iudgement in deedes of armes, where vnto my sexe is not sufficiently abled. Neuerthelesse sir knight as you paynes haue bene greatest, therto witnesseth this whole multitude: so you prowesse in my iudgement, so much assureth on your parte, that without doinge wronge

to any of these Princes and knights, I may with good reason confer them vpon you. For this, if I knowe to do right vnto whome I ought, it is meete that you doe away your helmette, and sith youre deedes discouer who you are, it is no reason y^t you couer your selfe any longer." When the Princesse had thus sayd, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> not hauing power to excuse himselfe, vnlaced his helmette which being put off, his face seemed so beautifull by the heate and trauayle of the armour, which raysed a fresh redde in hys cheekes, that is str<unclear>o</unclear>ke them all in a maze, and none of those which saw him, considering his fayrenesse with his age, but rather iudging him an Angel of heauen, then a mortall knight.</p><p>When the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> sawe him so fayre, as already loue had made a wracke in the most secret part of hir hearte by the viewe of his knighthoode, so nowe the same breache being made wyder by the seconde assulte in his beautifull lookes, loue entred with banner displayed and finding no resistaunce, tooke possession wholly of hir hearte, and swore all that he founde to be his true prysoners. Thus lost she hir libertie, and yet with the beste courage that a woman mighte, shee framed out a countenaunne of great freedome in this manner. "You needed not by your fauoure sir knight to haue bene ashamed of your face, and yet such as it is, it is farre inferiour to your manhoode, but this is beyond the cōpasse of my commission, now come you neere and receiue at my handes the glory of your worthinesse, which your good Fortune yeldeth you." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> approching very neere kneeled down and the Princese put the choller about his necke, and the crowne vpon his heade. When the Princesse had so done with a little staye betweene, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> tooke the crone from his owne heade, and as he was on his knees sayde vnto the Princesse. "Most excellent Princesse for the souereigne grace you haue shewed me, I will remayne yours hencefoorth to serue you loyally, as poore recompence

for so rich a benefit. And as I doe receiue this choller as the price of knighthoode in your opinion, so I beséeche you to take of me this crowne as a testimonie of your surpassing beautie in my eye." With this he set y^e rich crowne vpon the golden haires of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, she béeing glad of this gift, although somewhat blushing at the wordes, he spake. The two Princes <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> standing by and knowinge him to be <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> whom they had lost in the maine sea, when the cerimonies were finished, went to him, embracing him as a goodly as if he had bene their owne brother yet courteously challenging him for his vnkindenesse in not making him selfe knowen vnto them. The king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> abashed at so grat bountie in a knight of so young yeares began to thincke more aduisedly of that which the wise <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> had sayde, from that time he estéemed more highly of the newe knight, as you shall heare after this. But now the noise was so great which the vyals made &amp; other instruments that one might not heare an other speake, at which time the faire Princesse <name>Oliuia</name> with the riche crowne vpon hir head, and in hir company y^e knight <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with the two Princes descended form the scaffold, and in great pompe went to the kings pallaice, the Princesse leauing them ther to take hir own lodging, &amp; they al entring the chamber of presence where the king staied for thē, &amp; after a generall welcome by name taking <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> aside, he said vnto him. "Sir knight hether you are very welcome, for I haue had great desire to knowe you, &amp; I would to god by your stay I might as wel be acquainted with you, for by you the honour of my court hath ben well vpholden. Mightie king aunswered <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, I am rather to be borne withall if I desire to be your seruaunt, sith for the same cause and for to sée your court I am come hether. The king kissed the knight vpon the chéeke as tenderly as if he had bene his owne sonne, saying. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, I account more of these wordes then of y^e worth of"

my best citie, and aduise thée well of these speaches, for I am to demaund them of thée if thou wilt not otherwyse performe thy promise. So <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> was retained for the kings knight, and all the olde courtiers both Princes and knightes of great name ranne to embrace <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with great pleasure vnto thē to haue his company, except onely <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Lusitania</name>, whō a ielous thought vexed as towardes <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> for that hee had vnhorsed hym in the presence of his Lady. But after this order <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> remained in the English court, where he rested himselfe till this sodeine aduenture called him foorth as shall be tolde you.</p></div><div id="mirrour037" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ A gentlewoman came to the court from the Princesse Briana, which made him follow Brandagedeon.

hauing engrauen his Image so depely in hir immagination, y^t he neuer departed from hir thought, but euermore there renewed in hir remembraunce his knightly déedes and great valour, whereby she made an euident demonstration of his linage as if naught els had bene enimy to hir purpose. But this faire Princesse now so languished with y^e tormēt of this amorous thought &amp; pleasant liking of hir loue <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, that nowe the conuersation of hir gentlewomen was yerksome and to be solitarie did most content hir, forbearing withal, both hir rest in sléepe, &amp; hir sustenaunce in féeding. In which melancholy she was so far gone without the feeling of hir owne disease, as y^t nothing might ease hir highnesse but <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> presence, which bred hir greater bale in his absēce, by y^e griefe galling hir most to thinck that seing he was a straunger in y^e land, he would ere long retourne to his own countrey. One day casting hir selfe vpon hir bed, and tossing suche like things in hir fancie, she sent out many a sorrowfull sigh as y^e forerūners of this which followeth. "O loue, loue how wel it eased me before times to heare louers mourn, to read their straunge fits, to see figured before me y^e variable successe of their attempts, with the feareful frights of thy subiectes and captiues. O how well at ease was I when being farre from the fire &amp; out of daunger, I might laugh &amp; loke on, &amp; warme me by their flame. But now not so frée nor clean deuoid of thought, I rue the little pitie I toke vpon their paine, &amp; am therfore scorched not without desert. O loue, loue, by whom, not the feblest onely, but the sturdiest also &amp; stoutest are vnable to quench this fire, if it please thee to kindle it. Alas do not y^e wisemen seme fooles, &amp; y^e hardy cowards if it be thy pleasure: &amp; dare any man cōfesse y^e truth in this his passiō, &amp; are not al like sicke men beguiled, call sowre swéete, payne pleasure, bale blisse, griefe gladnesse, &amp; the losing of their late libertie y^e enlarging of their new franchise to contēt their fancies. And thou vnfortunite <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> art thou Princesse of great
<pb n="196" ed="digital" entity="13801:80" pages="99"/><milestone n="[99L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><name rend="roman">Britaine</name> the daughter of king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name>, the woman sued vnto by so pliant peticioners both Princes and knightes of great courage, whom thou hast all refused. No assuredly, but thou art so<unclear>m</unclear>e base and meane gentlewoman if the sight of one onely knight not knowen vnto thée hath so dimmed thy vnderstandinge, that reason is become no more defensible. Where is thy late pride <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, where is thy auncient pleasure, where are thy hautye lookes, where lyes the charter of thy libertie, where is the estimation of thy beautie, where is the excellencie of thy estate. O the miserable and euerchaungebale state of man, lyke vnto the hearbes or flowers whiche the morninges dewe refresheth, the noones heate opresseth, and the night shade encloseth in, as the graue doth our bodyes: beeinge a liuely morrall of our mortalitie. Alas <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, my father thinckes he hath made a great purchase by thy being here, but I would to God I might be as sure heire to this purchase, as I am otherwise certeyne to repent thy comminge hether. And yet whatsomeuer the euent be, my loue commaundes in me the contrary. For is it not better for me to see <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, and to acknowldge the goodnesse of God towardes man, in inhablinge of him to the achieuement of suche wonders, whereby and by the enioying of his sight I receiue suche pleasure, then neuer to haue seene him though I lose the hope of augmenting my state. And truely befall what maye in spight of Fortunes rancour, I wyll staie my selfe vppon this choise, and wyll not exchaunge it," Verie wyse was the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, and as the tymes affoorded very well learned, but yet these speaches proceded rather of hir passion, then of aduised reason or good readinge. And the lyke combatte to this of contrary thoughtes <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> endured, entertaining in his hearte the counterfaict of the princesse in y^e secret contemplation whereoff he was diligently occupied, immagining theroff the brauorie of hir beautie, and the great desert in hir to

be best beloued. But as againe to the Princesse in all this subiection to loue &amp; his lawes, hir honesty is chiefly to be noted, which for all that both y^e remedy was aboue hir capacitie, &amp; the paine likely to ouercome hir paciēce: yet bare out the bruntes thereof in such modestie rather by sufferaunce then striuing withall, that neither coulde <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> euer assure himselfe of hir liking, nor any of hir seruaunts wring it out by the maner of hir desease. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> was as close, which in him was the occasion of farther trouble, for coueting to be alone the better to reioyce himselfe, and to enter more narowly into the serch of his owne habilitie with the likelihood of his sute, hee stumbled as in a blinde way vpon two blockes so placed as that if he auoided the one, he must néedes hit his shin against the other: For this was one. If he reuealed not his griefe or not made hir priuie to his estate, there was naught to preferre him before an other knight. Againe y^e other was, if he laid open his race, his supplicatiō would lacke succour. Nowe howe could hee with candlelight, not hazard a fall vpon the one or the other. For he was perswaded y^e prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name>, brother to the princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> was his father, wherefore the néere kinred was to be concealed if he looked for helpe, and yet the concealment was the onely debarring of his hope. In this conflict he did nothing but afflict himselfe, neither daring to discouer his malady, nor minded to dissemble it altogehter, by so much the more in worse case then y^e Princesse was, as the infirmitie of hir sexe did lessen hir paine by yelding at the first, and the magnanimitie of his courage to haue the mastery, did in the end make the déeper impression in his flesh, like as in nature the hardest fight is betwéene the hardiest, &amp; sooner shall the cannon shot deface y^e high towers, then breake through a rampier of wooll or flaxe, and so the issue proued in him. But béeing one daye with the king and the other noble Princes in y^e great pallaice to beguile his solēne conceits which ouercame his nights

"God preserue your maiestie most noble king of the great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>. The Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> my mistresse and wife vnto the Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name> your sonne, with the remēbraunce of hir duetie, craueth to be certifyed by your good grace what you haue heard of hir Lord and husband, for she neuer saw him since his first arriual into <name rend="roman">Hungary</name>. My Lady also by me gréeteth y^e Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name><sic>you</sic> daughter, vnto whom she commaunded me to deliuer a cofer of iewels, but cōming to land on y^e <sic>Enlish</sic> coast, I was set vpon by a great gyant, named <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> as I heare, who taking the cofer from me bad me come to this court, here to tel a new knight which once vnhorsed him, y^t he would make aunswere to none but to him as concerning the coffer, and that for him he would stay at y^e shore, there to make satisfaction according as he was charged. I beséech your good highnes therfore to send that newe knight in your daughters quarrel against this Gyant." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>hauing knowne this gentlewoman amongst those which attended vpon the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> his mother in the monastery of the riuer, &amp; that shée had to name <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> was glad to haue y^e oportunitie offred to serue the Princesses <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> and <name rend="roman">Briana</name>, and therefore rysing from where he sat he came before the king, to whō he sayd. "Sir séeing it is <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> whom this gentlewoman séeketh, and that <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> hath sent for mée, I beseech your maiestie to giue me licence to goe in these affaires, for it is out of reason to forslacke such worthy seruice to two so noble Princes."

The gentlewoman woulde not importune him farther, but ledde him towardes the Gyant, where not farre off, they mette an other gentlewoman on foote weping verye piteously. At hir <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> demaunded the cause of hir griefe, which she vttered strayghtwaies in these wordes. "O sir knight, Fortune, Fortune hath frowned on me, so that better welcome should be the deathe then the dayelyght. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> yet requested hir to speake more playnly, and to tell wherein Fortune had wrought hir suche dispite.

Well sayd <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> if you will go with me you may at leasure when you see the euent deliberate what to doe. If ye will not fare you well, for lesse shalbe your hope of remedie in keeping your way as you nowe doe." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> helde on, and the gentlewoman viewing his goodly personage, thereby perswading hir selfe that it were but little losse to tourne backe with him, determined to proue his good Fortune. And as she was not fully assured in hir thought, shee spake on this wyse. "Be not displeased with me but for the loue of God fayre knyghte haue some greater regard of your owne safetie, not to cast your selfe away for the recouery of my dāmage, it is no great matter for me to take some paynes in goyng with you: but it wilbe some griefe to retourne agayne laden wiht a fresh complaynt of a new murder.

So they foure trauayled towardes the place where the Gyants abiding was, and comming néere vnto the shore they sawe him harde by the water where he sate vpon a great horse, and more then thirtie knights in a crayer not farre off, as if they purposed to boord a tall ship, which was on floate in the Sea halfe a mile. <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> by and by knew <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to be the new knight by the rich armour he bare, the selfesame being worn by him in the iusts, wherein he was hurled to grounde for which cuase preuenting <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> salutacion, with a loud and hollow voice he cried vnto him.

This first iourney brake their staues &amp; made them try the rest of the battayle on foote. The Gyant being clean vnhorsed &amp; <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> horse giuing backe, so y^t he rusht agaynst y^e ground, but y^e succes was diuers &amp; unequal in y^e riders themselues.

but hir pleasure was soone ouercast, for their was ministered vnto hir a cup of colde water in stéede of better lyking to alay hir thirst. Al this happening beyond hir expectation, by y^e Gyants knights, which seing their maister at such an exigent although in no euident apparance of his ende, in great fury came to lande, and at once all of them with their swordes fell vpon <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. This was no euen match, thirtie knights and a Gyant to set vpon one silly knight, before almost tyred with two houres battaile against y^e Gyant. But what thing may resist Gods ordinaunce? The Gyants knights layd on with such courages, that it reuiued the Gyant, for they were all chosen knights, but I doubte not but that <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> besturred himselfe, for so many as he mette, hee either maymed, wounded, slewe, or threwe to grounde. And being ouerawed by number and fresh onsettes, he was fayne for defence to his backe, to withdrawe himselfe into the Sea, there to stand in the water and receiue their blowes before him</p><p>Nowe <name rend="roman">Telyo</name> his squyre and <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> the <name rend="roman">Hungarian</name> seing him forced to this extremitie were very wo begon, but the gentlewoman <name rend="roman">Lusitanian</name> as desperate of all succours by his meanes, gallopped from thence vpon hir palfray which stode by the shore, no lesse complayninge the daunger wherein she lefte this good knight, then recurelesse lamenting the vniust death of hir brother. As she had ridde some parte of hir way towardes <name rend="roman">Oliuerios</name> courte, there were two knights in hir iudgement very lusty and armed at all poynts which made all the hast they mighte to gette néere hir.</p><p>This gentlewoman comming within the hearing of them, and minding to preuent other questions, cryed vnto them a farre off. "For the passy<unclear>o</unclear>n of God my good Lords if all noblenes and vertue be not cleane buried in you, make hast to succour a knighte the best in the world, which is now enuironned with his enemyes being about"

thirtie knights besides a Gyant. The two knights with these newes posted a mayne, and by the same way which y^e gentlewomā came, in short time got a sight of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, which at y^e time stode in y^e water against xi. or xii. of thē: for so many were left on liue of thirtie persons, those also which then lyued being well nurtured by <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> discipline, that they woulde prease vppon him without good warrantise.</p><p>Now by that time that the two knights came, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had killed more then twentie, leauing a passage so well trode as they might easely trace out his footesteppes. At their first breaking in among the Gyants knights they burst their staues vppon two of thē ouerthrowing them, and then drawing their swordes strake so lustely that the assaylants were glad to leaue <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, and to defende themselues against the two knights. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> hauing so good helpe at hande, although he was stirred with the continuall heate of the foote battayle, would néedes be a partie player in the last act of this tragedye, and therefore chose out <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> to deale withall, and with hys sharpe sword gaue him so fierce a stoccadoe, that the bowells trayled after the weapon, and the Gyant fell downe. Now being thus put in possession of his desire, he came to the two knightes vtterin these or such lyke speaches. "I beséech you noble knights to lette me knowe at whose hands I haue receiued so good maintenance, that I may the better giue you thancks according to the state of your degrée and your demerites towardes mee. One of the knights aunswered. You are not to thancke vs, for your owne hand had wrought your escape before our cōming, but neuertheles at your request we are contēt to discouer our selues, and straight wayes they vnlaced their helmets whereby <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> knewe them, the one to be <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and the other <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> his deere friendes. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> after his presupposed thancks so happely stumbling on his friendes helpe, fell to other matters, and first asked of

them for what cause they came thether, they made aunswer that the only feare they had left the Gyants knights should at once enclose him, moued them to abandon the court for his rescewes. And as this talke was intterrupted by the comming of the two gentlewomen and <name rend="roman">Telyo</name><name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> squire to demaund leaue of serch in y^e Gyants boate for the cofer and fardell which had bene taken from them, so after the gentlewoman with leaue obtayned, departed for to search: these there knights began a déepe consultacion of their owne affaires and what they ought to do. <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> spake first in this wise. "We haue this moneth and more loytered very idelly in kyng <name rend="roman">Oliuerios</name> court without exercise of armes or armoure, therefore it wer not misbeseeming vs knights if we should for a time forbeare our retourne to practise déedes of armes that our good name &amp; honour may enlarge our credit in this kingdome, and be a meanes of the sure settling of our memories in this lande, and the rather thereto am I ledde, for that I will not feare any disworship or vanquish in your company. I am content sayth the newe knight with this or any other thing which you shall deuise. But what shall we doe with these gentlewomen. Mary saith <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name>, they shall retourne to the court with the dead body of the Gyant, ther to present his carcase before the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> as a token from thée <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and in part of payment for the great dishonour which the Gyant hath profered hir in witholding hir Jewels. They may lykewise when they be there make all our excuses vnto the king for our so sodayne departure."</p><p>By this time the gentlewomen retourned with theire owne carriadge, and what with the lengthe of battaile, and other accidents, the daye was so farre shutte in, that being verye darke they were constrayned altogether to tourne into a kéepers house néere at hande, where they were welcome at such warninge. For hee knewe the thrée knights at the great feastes, wherefore hée en-

tertayned them as honourably as he might. That night not hauing wherwith otherwise to busie themselues, and the opportunitie of the bearers putting them in minde of their mistresses, they gaue themselues to enditing euery man of seuerell letters vnto his loue and Lady. <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> deliuered theirs vnto the gentlewoman of <name rend="roman">Lusitania</name>, but the other not willing to make manifest his choyse for that time tooke <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> a letter closely to carry vnto the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> his good Ladie, and afterwardes amongst other talke he required to sée the cofer of Jewelles which the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> sent to <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, as it is had bene onely to haue séene the riches thereoff, <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> gaue him the cofer which he opened, and tossing vp and downe as if to sée all the Jewelles, he secretely conuayed his letter to <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> vnder all the papers, and redelyuered he cofer without being suspect. Well to make and ende the talke had an end, &amp; when y^e rest went to their reast, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> fel into his ordinary humor, driuing in his thought, the whole order of the deliuery, and hir receite, with hir manner of tourning ouer the papers to viewe euery Jewell, this being but the first assay of the humor, but when his fancie brought him to the finding of the letter, Lorde what a fight he sustayned, for the better vnderstanding whereoff, you must immagine a young scholler but lately entred into schole poyntes ouerséeing of hys théame before hée bringe it to the reviewe of hys schoolemayster, and beléeue mée in farre greater doubte hunge <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> of his Ladyes lyking then the boye doth of his maysters.

And beginning to recken a freshe after this comfort, he stayed himselfe vppon these two poynts, first that sith he was diseased, his remedye must begin by making his griefe knowne: second that his conscience tolde him ther was nothing in the letter, the truth whereof he durst not auowche as concerning either his owne person or the Princesse, and this was his nightes reste as I suppose.</p></div><div id="mirrour039" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ Rosicleer and the two Princes seeke aduentures in the lande of Britaine, &amp; the two gentlewomen carrie the Gyants bodye to Oliuerios courte.

The <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> knyght was much abashed at the great force of these two knyghtes, for hée had not thought to haue mette two so stronge knyghtes in all this lande, and when there remayned none but one knyghte, and he lykewyse without a staffe to iuste withall, hee came to this one and bydde the base to the swoorde play, in these termes.</p><p>"Syr knyght, sith both of vs wante speares to iuste withall, it shall be well to make vp this lacke wyth our swoordes, that you maye either reuenge the shame of your companyons or else goe wyth them for companye, and all three present your selues prisoners to the kynge your Lorde.

Assuredly Syr knyght (sayd this odde man which was <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>) were it not for the duetie whiche I owe to my companions, and for that you shoulde ill acquyte their courtesies if you shoulde leaue me scotfree to scorne at their mishappes, I woulde that thys combatte wyth swoords should be excused, for that I am not accustomed to fight for so small a cause, but sith that both my companions challenge thys at my handes, and that it is a poynte of cowardlynesse to leaue the combatte, and also that you will not haue vs to breake companyes.

But <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> rather delighted then afraye at his enemyes courage, deuysed by himselfe howe to winne that valyaunt knight for friende and to leaue the combatte, for vppon so slender a quarrell hee thought the hazarde would be to great. Mary for all that he dyd his best, for when he felte the stronge buffettes hee coulde not but yelde the like. The <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> knyght burning in rage, rather to haue y^e mastry ouer so valiant knights, rather thē for any ill will he bare to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, compassed howe by mayne force to subdue his aduersary, &amp; in this thought he strake so furiously that with his charge and the others aunswere the noyse was so confused and great wythall, that it was hearde vppon the toppe of hylles and the shotte of Artilerie: When the <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> knight was so well heated as you haue heard, hée draue a bl<unclear>o</unclear>we with both his handes full at <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> head, which lighting vppon the fine and inchaunted helmette, nothwithstandinge depriued <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> of his eye sight &amp; enfeebled his hearing at that time. But <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> could not so soone forgette it, and therefore whyle it was freshe in hys remembraunce, he restored the lyke blow which in y^e descending missed the <name rend="roman">Tartarians</name> crest, otherwyse it had put hym in daunger. But slydinge vppon his shoulder it was so heauie that it made the <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> stoupe to his horse backe.

After not without some abashment as one come out of an other world: the <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> when hée felte the bloude issuynge in suche measure, lyft vp his hande and callinge for helpe on hys Gods, sayinge. Assist mee O my Gods agaynste thys fell knyghte, for if I tarrye more of these blowes my lyfe shall soone bee ended, and when he had so sayde, as purposed to make an ende of the fraye hée tooke his swoorde with both hys handes, and wyth all hys force followinge the blowe, he smote <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> vppon the helmette to no greate harme on his bodye, but the weight thereoff astonished hym as muche as if a Towre had falled vppon hym, whereat <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> waxed madde angrye, and not remembringe that whiche before hee had premeditate as to ende the battayle in quyetnesse, hee repayed the trespasse wyth treble dammage to the <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name>. For albeit the <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> myght well bée reckened amonge the moste famous knightes of elder tyme, beeing couered wyth a helmette so well tempered as any Prince myght haue, yet liuinge in that age and encounteringe suche knyghtes, hys roome was but nexte to the beste. And when hee sawe that terrible blowe ouer hys heade, hee coulde haue wyshed a whole mountayne betwéene hym and it. But there needed no suche impossible meanes to auoyde thus misfortune, for it was prouyded by the diuine maiestye of God that thys noble knyght shoulde dye a Chrystian, and that greate friendshyppe shoulde growne betweene these three knyghtes, and therefore God so dyrected <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> hande, that it fell not right, but glaunce-

"Noble and valyant knyght, the strongest and mightiest whiche I haue euer knowne, or haue beléeued euer to haue bene in thys courte or others, pardon mée my rashnesse for I haue bene mysaduised when my wyll firste put me foorth to contende with you, onely your greatnesse of body and comlinesse might haue sufficed to teache mee that you were more valyaunt and stronger then I am, and sith I am nowe vanquyshed, and rather by greate myracle escaped wyth lyfe from your handes then my myne owne cunninge, saye on what you commaunde, for I am preste to accomplishe all that whiche was agreed uppon before our combatte, and my duetie shall not bee slacked in any pointe, but I woulde rather fulfill more than all that, for to gayne the societie of your worthy person and your companions, for I neuer mette with more nobler knightes for valoure and bounteousnesse, and so saying yelded himself.

Good knight I accepte in good parte that whiche you haue sayde, and it gréeueth me muche to haue had the battayle with you, for vnto a knight straūger and valorous, I had rather be a meanes for procuring a honour and ease, then their trouble and incombraunce, &amp; as to the articles of the couenaunt which you remember me off.

Likewyse we three shall take it as a signe of your good liking toward vs, if you make vs priuie to your name, that hereafter we may knowe you and doe vnto you that honour which so good a knight meriteth. Sir knight, aunswered the <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name>, I haue great desire to goe and kisse the hande of king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name>, as well to knowe him as to satisfie that which I owe vnto you, and will not fayle to depart and take my way toward the king. But to your last demaūd I am as I tolde you before a <name rend="roman">Tartarian</name> and my name is <name rend="roman">Zoilo</name> Prince and heyre of that kingdome whiche I would with good will forbeare for some <sic>timei, f</sic> you and these knightes would vouchsafe your acquaintaunce and company, for I haue more desire to trauayle in these partes then in that countrey from whence I came, bycause there is no coninuall afforde of knightes and fresh accidentes as I finde in this kingdome, and I shoulde more highly esteeme of the friendshippe and societie of such noble and worthy knightes then of any riches in the worlde. And nowe for that I haue declared who I am, I shall thincke my selfe farther in your debte if you make your selues farther knowne vnto me." <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and his companions gladly heard of his byrth &amp; lignage, but much gladder of the friendshyp whereto he requested them, so they gaue him manye thancks, &amp; told him who they were. Diuers speaches of great courtesy passing betweene them, whereby their amitie was so sure confirmed that it remayned vnto the <unclear>de</unclear>ath, euery one laboring to be found most friendly. And this done they appoynted that Prince <name rend="roman">Zoilo</name> should goe to the court, onely to haue a sight of the kinge, and that <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> with his companions shoulde abyde hym thereabout, then they foure to trauaile together whether For-

This being concluded, the Prince of <name rend="roman">Tartarye</name> tooke his waye towarde the courte of king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> thinking long to finde the time for his retourne. They tooke the way towards a forest where the history leaueth them, to intrreat of the gentlewomen in the meane tyme, which broughte the bodye of the great <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> vnto the courte of king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name>.</p></div><div id="mirrour040" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The gentlewomen brought the bodye of Brandagedeon to the courte, and the Princesses receiued the letters of their knightes.

So the faire Princesse as vnacquaynted and to beginne in such passions, not being able at the first to counsayle hir selfe otherwise, thought it best to discouer hir griefe to one of hir gentlewomen "named <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> the faythfullest and most secret of hir householde, the which many times had importuned hir to knowe the cause of hir sorrowe, and one night as she was alone with hir the Princesse sayde to hir.

wherein I haue alwayes found thée plyant and dyligent, with the like confidence vnto that which I alwayes haue reposed in thee, I will vnfolde vnto tée a secret, which none in the world my selfe except and thy selfe shall learne at my hands, in the concealyng whereoff, vnto this day I haue a thousand times endured lyttle lesse then deathe. And the matter is such, that it is vnfitting for any one to be a dealer therein but my selfe and thy selfe whome I account as my selfe. At a woorde by <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> that tyrant loue which spareth neither high nor lowe, hath taken possession of me by the great prowesse and beautie of the newe knight, and I am sure that but my deathe, nothing can sette mee frée: althoughe I haue studyed all possible meanes of my lybertie, and thereto haue sette the defence of my honesty and great estate to withstande this conceit, yet for all that I can doe, as longe as this knights race is vnknowen I cannot case my selfe, my former remedyes seruing me only agaynst the temptacion of the flesh, and not to driue out the remembraunce of his personage, whence my desire springeth. And truely I cannot perswade my selfe other, thē y^t this knights offspring is right noble, he béeing of so courtlyke behauiour and knightlye prowesse the truth hereoff, béeing somewhat more incredible, then the lying fables of our auncient Poets. Now if he be a Prince borne, the onely hope to haue him for husbande, my father and he being therwith pleased, may yeelde one some comformt, in the meane time while opportunite serueth for the finall accomplishment. Wherefore myne owne <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> seeing that I haue fully layde open the bottome of my heart, that which remayneth one thy parte, is to trauayle with his squire or some other to witte of what parentage <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> is." <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> had lystened very attentiuely to that which hir Ladye had sayde, and as shee was very wise, so perceiuing by the dryfte of the speache, that neither hir mistresse maladye coulde be remoued by counsayle, nor that she woulde accepte of

it if it were bestowed, besides that, that hir desire was lawefull to match with <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, if there were not disparage in his stocke. She coulde not gaynesay hir mistresse in flatte termes, but made aunswere, that sith hir grace had layde that charge vppon hir shée was contente to receiue, as also readye to offer hir seruice in any other thing for this matter which she now moued, she sayde that sith hir graces purpose was so good shee shoulde not neede to remember hir farther in it, for that so soone as <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> shoulde retourne she woulde be in hande with his squyre to boult out the truth of euery thing, and yet (sayth shee) I cannot beleue by reason of his mangnanimitie but that he is descended from some noble progeny, which if it so be I lyke verye well that your grace is so affectioned towardes hym, otherwise I dare not aduise you, but yet I will tel you my fancie, it wer better for you to abide some payne, then to make your head of your vnderlyng. The beautifull Princesse was well apayed at this counsayle so iumping with hir former determination, and it greatly asswaged the mallice of hir passion, in that shee had bewrayed it to hir trusty seruaunt. The next day the gentlewomen entred into the pallayce, driuing a horse before them loded with the Gyants body. At their entraunce the hurly burly in the court was so great, euery man running to sée the wonder, that the king with all those which wer with him and the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> with hir gentlewomen ranne to their windows to sée what the matter was, and when they sawe the Gyant they knew hym, and as newely abashed at <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> vertues, they began to commend of him as of the best knight in the world. The gentlewomen presentlye were broughte before the king which receiued them courteouslye, and they in order declared vnto him and the rest what which had chaunced to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> since his departure from the Cittye. The king lyked verye well of all, saue that when they tolde hym that the knightes could not retourne presentlye

as minding to pursue aduentures. For the king feared, left by being so much enclyned to knightly déedes, theire good succes would carrie them farther off then should be for his pleasure. But the gentlewomen departed form the king to do their message vnto the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, whom they founde in hir chamber with the two other Princesses in hir company. Comming before hir they delyuered their message with commendacions from <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> and the two Princes, which had sent hir that Gyant so dead as a satisfaction in some parte for the detayning of hir Jewelles. The Princesse pleasauntly laughing at that presente, caused the gentlewomen to go on in that storye, and to make reporte of all occurrentes in their iourneye, which they did so faithfully that the Princesse in the tellyng was not able to colour hir affection towardes <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. This tale ended, <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> gaue into hir handes the packette, which the Princesse opened, and tourning ouer the Jewelles founde a letter, which she put in hir bosome taking it to be <name rend="roman">Brianas</name>, and in lyke sorte the gentlewoman of <name rend="roman">Lusytania</name> made delyuerye of <name rend="roman">Bargandel</name> and <name rend="roman">Liriamandros</name> vnto their Ladyes, with the cofer vnto <name rend="roman">Rodasylua</name>. The two Princesses, <name rend="roman">Syluerina</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Rodasylua</name> being great friendes, went both together in a closette to reade without interruption their loues letters so eloquent and so fraught with amorous speaches, which much reioyced the young Ladyes to be beloued of so good knights and not to breake off their seuerall commendacions of their knights and Lordes, wee will speake of the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, who being left alone for y^e company of y^e two Princesses dispatched hir other gentlewomen into diuers parts of the chamber, to haue a more secret suruay of <name rend="roman">Brianas</name> letters.</p><p>When shee had redde on through that which was deliuered with the packet, she tooke that other out of hir bos<unclear>o</unclear>me, which shee had founde in ransacking the packette, and opening it she sawe in capytall letters <name rend="roman">RO-</name><pb n="221" ed="digital" entity="13801:90" pages="111"/><milestone n="111     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><name rend="roman">SICLEER</name> subscribed, wherby she knew it to be his, &amp; somewhat troubled she foulded it vp quickly agayne, minding to learne by what meanes that letter was hidde among the Jewelles. And therefore calling <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> she asked if that any one had vnlocked the cofer, after that hir Ladye had delyuered it vnto hir. <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> supposing that the Princesse had wanted something, aunswered.

The Princesse smelling out <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> shifte, and somewhat smiling withall, to heare wherevnto <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> had construed hir meaning, replyed merely thus. I asked it not gentle friende for that I thought there wanted any thing in the cofer, for it was wholly lost when it was in <name rend="roman">Brandagedeons</name> power, but I asked it for that I meruayled it fell out so well, when <name rend="roman">Brandagedeon</name> was the kéeper. <name rend="roman">Arinda</name> waxing bolde hereat.

Yet in the meane time that <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> redde the letter, the fayre Princesse broade awake to heare those amorous wordes, and féelyng them in hir heart with the lyke loue wherein <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> wrote them.

Ah <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> what force may a tender gentlewoman as I am haue for to resist the tyrannye of loue, when so many famous and so mighty Princes could neuer cōquer him?

nothing wondring at that effect which loue had wrought in the Princesse hir Ladie, for she rather wished hir selfe worthy of so glorious payne, aunswered hir thus. Madame to counsayle you arighte were to will you to defie loue, and to abandon <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> companye, and yet the words of this letter leueth in me a doute theroff, if y^e matter be as true as the words importeth. Next were to desire you to haue an eye vnto your high estate, which yet me thincketh is not necessary, for I knowe you to be so wise, as that you will hazarde death rather then commit a thing so preiudiciall to your honour. Nowe there remayneth onely to learne out <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> lynage, that if he be such a one as maye marry you without disworshippe, you may then beginne the redresse of both your wronges, otherwise if he fayle in that poynt, the first counsayle will be most conuenient to eschewe his presence, which shall in time doe away this affection, as in time all things are forgotten.</p><p>Héere the Princesse interrupting <name rend="roman">Fidelias</name> speach, replyed in this manner. Ah <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name>, you thincke me not such a one but that although the loue which I beare vnto <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> be such that it procureth me to will his presence, if he fayle in gentrye, I will rather <sic>t</sic>hastise his boldnesse with perpetuall exile out of this lande, then giue him comforte to the empaire of my credite, and sooner will I dye an hundred times, then bestowe a countenaunce vppon such a one. But this I iudge of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> by the pure and loyall loue which he meaneth towardes mee, that it is lykely he may merite me for wife, otherwise it is to bee thought that in a knight so vertuous ther cannot lye hidden such impudencie as to moue a Lady vnto hir dishonour. In such lyke talke after the letter redde the Princesse and <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> passed the most parte of the nighte tyll <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> tooke hir leaue, the Princesse notwithstanding stil canuasing ouer the letter of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, and euery swéete worde which he had written, and she prayed to God with

you shall vnderstand that they be sonnes to a knight named <name rend="roman">Leonardo</name> not of the most noble, but of the meanest knightes of the Citie, and for that their father hathe to wyfe a woman, sister to a gentlewoman of my Ladyes named <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> for hir longe seruice in great fauour wyth hir grace: for hir sake the Princesse made the parentes of these children to nourse them vp in the monastery at hir charges vntill they were all lost as I made mention.

therto hath maynteined my rest is nowe ended, I would to God my life woulde ende withall, and rather woulde I dye not to heare such newes whereby my hope decayes then to be priuie to such a trueth, and liue without my comfort. Oh my <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name>, come, come, and helpe mee nowe either to set forwarde my mishap with some desperate shyft, or to lende me thy faithfull counsell and aduise the better to asswage my griefe and to forgette the same misfortune which nowe assayleth mee. Alas I séee that it is not for my quyetnesse to <sic>bnanish</sic><name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, and if by the excellency of my estate I am forced to chastyse his ouerboldnesse, in so dooing I shall both barre him from the sight &amp; light of his eyes and make the stripe redound vpon myne owne head, for who shall receiue greater smarte by his absence thē I shall. What a wicked world is this, wherein men of force must neglect other mens vertues, and mangifie their owne nobilitie wythout deserte: were it not more reason to rayse this man to the toppe of honour y^t in him his posteritie may glory, then for lacke of auncestors famous for like qualities, to suppresse his vertue and kéepe vnder the magnanimitie of his courage? When began my fathers &amp; grandfathers to be nobles, but when with the winges of vertue they soared aboue the vulgar sort, and if by their meanes onely I am aduaunced to be a Princesse, what thancke is there to mee of my highnesse? and thou <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> if by those rare &amp; souereygne vertues which flower and florish in thée, thou dost mount in credit, not onely aboue the baser sort from whom thou wast taken, but also aboue Princes &amp; Lords, whervnto thou art to make thy assent, art not thou worthy of greater renowne then we others whych clymbing by vertue in lyke sorte, neuer yet came to the possibylytie of like worthinesse? Is not this a forgery of the world and a playne ingling wyth nobility, when we must make more account of one which perhaps by disorder of life defaceth y^e honour of his race, then of one which reacheth vp

the ignobilitie of his stocke, wherein consisteth nobilitye in the opinion of men, or in vertue in déede? and doe men inherit vertue as the chylde entereth vppon the Fathers lande béeinge lawfull heyre? No, héere wee receyue naught but what our selues sowe, and hée that repeath not maye be a loute for all his Lordshippe, as in tyme appeareth, whiche iudgeth fréely and wythout affection. And for mee, if the eyes of my vnderstandinge were not dymmed, I shoulde soone confesse lesse merite in me to deserue <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> then wanteth in him to bee worthy of mé. I am a Princesse by my Father, and my glorye resteth in the reckening vp of a bed role of Princes, some of them dead a thousand yere agone, which nothing perteineth to thys presente age, but he maye be a Prince by hys owne vertue, and his nobilitie aryseth not by kéepinge a tally of names, but by makinge iuste proofe of his manhoode in defence of iustice euery daye, in suche sort likewise that not any of myne auncestors vertues whereby they became noble, dare approch to bee tryed with hys in an euen ballaunce. And is there not many gentlewomen in the worlde of as highe a callnge as I am? And is there any Prince or knyghte of so high renowne for vertue and knyghthoode as <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> is? Haue not the best knightes of both Christendome and <name rend="roman">Pagansie</name>, ioyned with him either at tylte or tourney, and doth he not obscure them all, as when the sunne appeareth, no starres dare come in presence? And I silly woman hauinge not so muche as the refuse in me of my predecessors vertue, am notwythstandinge by the iniurie of the times bonde to so greate folly, as that I must not thincke hym worthy to equall me, which is muche my better. But sith of force I must yeelde to the time and rather dye then acknolwedge the contrary, sith my Fortune is such that I must liue by the immagination of other men, and sith my estate may not be yoked with hys basenesse, haue at it, I

will for euer shutte him from my presence for the sauegard of myne honour. But withall seeinge wythout hys presence I cannot finde ease for this torment, I wyll make hym amendes by giuinge ouer my life vnto the enduringe of euerlastinge sorrowe. And if it bee beste so to doe, tell me my <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> my minde, for I perhappes am beguyled by my passion <unclear>ra</unclear>ther in deede haue I eyther iudgement or feelinge of ought but of griefe and sorrowe. <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name> hearde the woords of the Princesse, and taking parte with the Princesse made vp this woful lamenting wyth hir sorrowfull speach, in this sort. Alas madame howe much better had it bene that neuer the knightly deedes of <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had bene manifested in <name rend="roman">Britaine</name>, for then without the sight of him you had neuer receyued thys wounde whiche nowe festering in you for lacke of looking too will be very harde to be cured. But the wysest saye, that in suche matters as are harde and difficult a manne must especially employe hys trauayle, and that the successe is not so vnlikely, but that labours may reach vnto it, as for this griefe which nowe distempreth you is not so greate but that you maye bee soone whole, your selfe being ther vnto willing. For in this, neither Nature worketh, neither Fortune, nor the stars, nor the celestiall signes, nor any supernaturall influence as you suppose, but onely the fancie and likinge of man, the selfe same in effect with that which in the sicke is to desire to be whole and in the thirstie to drink. And whosoeuer with the consente of his owne will attempteth the breaking of these snares which hys fancy layeth to entrappe him in, may scape scotfree, and helpe others in lyke necessitie. Otherwise if this loue were naturall to all men, as all men then should loue by Nature, so should they not forbeare it, either for shame or friendes displeasure, and if it proceeded from Fortune, or by grace inspired, whereoff the cause is not knowen, but the euente is euident, then were our libertie herein <unclear>irrecuperable</unclear>, and

in that the principall suite was wythout vs it might excuse the infirmitie of the pacient, whereas both experience proueth, that loue hath bene remoued by reason, and we dayly chide their impotency which are not able to resist the dartes of <name rend="roman">Cupid</name>.

First <name rend="roman">Tullus Hostilius</name> had his cradell in a shepheardes cottage, and his bringing vp in the wide field. Then the two <name rend="roman">Tarquins</name> were sonnes to a Marchaunt and exiled their countrie. <name rend="roman">Seruius Tullius</name> was sonne to a bondwoman as his name importeth, all which notwithstanding in their times were kinges of <name rend="roman">Rome</name>, and if from thence we take our way to other Nations round aboute, what a flock of sheph<unclear>e</unclear>rds, surgeons, labouring men, founders, &amp; such like seruile occupations shall we méete which aspyred to the highest palce of gouernment in their countries. <name rend="roman">Alexander</name> a crowned kinge was a gardeiners sonne, <name rend="roman">Pertinax</name> Emperour of <name rend="roman">Rome</name>, borne of a slaue which lyued by thrashing of graine &amp; selling of wood, <name rend="roman">Seuerus</name> the seuenth Emperour of <name rend="roman">Rome</name> was bred and brought vp amongst surgions, &amp; these of the meanest sort. <name rend="roman">Agathocles</name> king of <name rend="roman">Sicile</name>, sonne to a potter. <name rend="roman">Maximianus</name> &amp; <name rend="roman">Maximns</name> chiefe men of the Empire, the one of base byrth, the other doubtfull whether a smith or a carpenter, and yet neither barrell better herring. <name rend="roman">Vespasianus</name> which was called the good Emperour, rose from low degree, &amp; by his vertue blotted out y^e infamny of his progeny, &amp; to haue more notable testimonies, who was father vnto y^e great <name rend="roman">Caesar Augustus</name> y^e ruler of y^e world. <name rend="roman">Virgil</name> in a iest made him a bakers son but his own minde misgaue him otherwise, as for a truth

worse be they which ryse to glorie from the mislikinge of their parents, like as <name rend="roman">Hercules</name>, <name rend="roman">Perseus</name>, &amp; <name rend="roman">Iug<unclear>u</unclear>rtha</name> the kinge of <name rend="roman">Numidia</name>, all begotten in aduoultry: and lykewyse mightie <name rend="roman">Alexander</name> kinge of <name rend="roman">Macedon</name>, as concerninge whom his fahter <name rend="roman">Philip</name> on his death bedde denyed him to be his sonne by the reporte of his mother <name rend="roman">Olympia</name>, for which cause after his fathers death hee woulde needes be called the sonne of <name rend="roman">Iupiter Ammon</name>:<name rend="roman">Constantine</name> the Emperour was borne of a younge mayde before lawfull espousalles: and <name rend="roman">Iepthah</name> in the Scriptures was sonne to a harlot: Or if you will madame that for lyke examples we runne ouer the histories whervnto my witte can not carry me in so sodeine speach, yet I remember that fewe yeares since there dyed in <name rend="roman">Spayne</name> a stoute kinge of the <name rend="roman">Gothes</name> called <name rend="roman">Bamba</name>, which as I haue heard was a labouring man, and at that time when he was to be crowned king was faine to sticke his spade in the ground to receiue the scepter, beeing neither lesse feared then his predecessors and not reserued by me to the last place, as one of least credite amonge others. Remember your selfe of the great king <name rend="roman">Arthur</name> your progenitour, of whom (with your graces leaue) I doe not thincke that men of mallice doubted whose sonne he was: and we maye boldly speake of these and other thinges so longe a gone passed, without suspect of misliked affection. But why meruayle we at these thinges? doth not the wise man saye. That if our life were long we should see many kings become bondmen, and of many bondmen crowned kinges: the reason beeing the same as I haue rehearsed, that in elder age the onely Herolde to pronounce a man either noble or vnnoble was hys owne good deedes which aduaunced his good name and renoune aboue the inferior deedes of kinges or Princes.

in the body of this trée there are many braunches, some higher and some onely waterboughes, from whome the toppeboughes keepe of the comforte both of Sunne and showers, yet no man I trowe wilbe so enuyous as to hinder the growth of the inferior, if they be more faithfull then the superior, as not alwayes the tallest men doe the best seruice, and the best borne for wealth or mighte proue not the best alwayes for the manners and worshippe. Witnesse hereto the sonnes of <name rend="roman">Scipio</name> and <name rend="roman">Marcus Aurelius</name>, of which two descended two peruerse imps, far more infamous thē their parēts wer famous. And ther ar infinit moe lykewise to improue the succession of vertue, in the succession of enheritaunce. And yet for all this long discourse, I cannot choose but reserue my former purpose towards you, for I am afrayde that the most parte will not be of my iudgement. In a worde therefore, to make an ende in that wherwith he first beganne, you must consider both by what meanes and for what causes the times are altered, and therevppon take aduise according to the time. And sith that for our sinnes God hath giuen vs euer to a wrong iudgement in matter of high estate, rather to preferre wealthe then vertue, and sith you are nowe fallen vnto that time, wherein this errour generally hath ouergrowen the truth, and is strengthened by consent of men I would counsayle you to yéelde vnto the time, that is to take it as you finde it, &amp; to make the best of your chaunce: for it were great folly for you, and no lesse daunger to resist a multitude, and you knowe your friends will neuer be brought to estéeme so highly of vertue in a base personage, although a precious stone can neuer be but precious whether sette in Leade or Copper. You must forsake him then, and that is the onely remedye, for according as I haue reade and haue hearde the first remedye agaynst a fitte of loue, is to exempt our selues from the companye of the beloued, or to shunne and eschew the things which maye bring it agayne to our remembraunce, the nexte

is to driue in our thoughts the things which be contratrary therevnto: as to thincke with how many breaches of sleepe and with what continuall care we desire a thing eyther filthy, if vnlawfully coueted, or at the least wyse transitory though neuer so honest, with all to sette before our eyes what hames, what robberyes, what murthers, what madnesse it hath caused in the world, whereoff ther be to many historyes: but yet from all this you may well acquite your selfe, if you will seperate from you your former conceit. And if none of these will suffice, there is an other remedy behinde, which is to bestow your lyking vppon such a one as may be machable to your estate. For as one naile driueth out an other so men say that the new loue dispossesseth y^e old, which remedy as I haue red was put in practise by <name rend="roman">Assyr<unclear>o</unclear>us</name> y^e kyng of <name rend="roman">Persia</name>. And this is my opinion, which it may be your grace woulde not mislyke, were it not somewhat troublous, but if you haue an eye to your benefite, thereby I doubte not but that you wil wel ouercome the trouble, &amp; I pray you spéedely take some way or other, but the best I saye still is the former for to alaye the flame. The next is, to take awaye the wood, and so to forgette loue, is to remoue from beloued, for otherwise that which you quenche in a moneth wilbe kindled in an houre.</p><p>Nowe the meanes to achieue your purpose, is by writing your selfe to <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> to this effect, that hee abandon your presence for euer, my selfe wilbe the carryer: althoughe I haue some compassion on hys payne.

The king excusing himsefe to the Princes for his owne dealing towardes <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> became verye sadde and heauy for him, as also those which were néere with him not being able to ghesse of his retourne: and in deede if they had ben certein of his long absence, it would much more haue bene grieuous vnto them, so rare was the loue they all bare to him.

But this thou takest to be impossible for thou art not touched wiht the lyke passions and none knowes the bitternesse thereoff but the experienced, as appeareth by thée which hast ministred a medicine not of force against my disease.

Withall sayth shée this ought presently to bée put in practise, for by the griefe <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> tooke at the sight of your letter, I ghesse that hee is eyther departed thys lyfe or auoided the countrey.

Now are there fewe alyue, and those eyther striuing for lyfe vpon the grasse, or in weake case vpon foote, readyer to flye then to fight: but presently ther came fresh succours from the other Castle. For the other sonne of <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name> with more then thirtie knights in great hast came agaynst this good knight not being idelly occupyed among the other knightes.

Sunne saying. Knight the most valyant that euer I met withall, I knowe not how to reward you for the greate friendship you haue shewed to me, but tell me your name I praye you and I shall account my selfe the happiest man this day lyuing, and while I lyue will I remember your valour. The Knighte of the Sunne noting the greate slaughter of knights with y^e manglyng of armour in that place wher y^e first batattayle had bene fought, besides the monstrous blow wherewith the firste Gyaunt had béene slayne, and after viewing his personage, his bearde but now burgening he pulled of his helmet and after the manifesting of his beautifull lookes suche as passed all the knightes of his time he aunswered gently. Right valyant knighte, I am to thancke my Gods for that they haue brought me hether in so good a time as to know so valyant a knight, and to see with mine eyes the knighthoode which I would scarce haue credited with mine eares: but whereas you demaunde of me who I am, know you that I am called the Knight of the Sunne for the deuise which I beare in my armour, and for my birth I can shew you no farther neither know I more of my estate: but the aduenture which brought me hether hath bene by occasion of a storme which draue me on this shoare, and this is the firste lande whereon I sette foote since this tempest tooke my ship, and courtesie commaunded me to lend mine aide when I saw you ouermatched with number. And thus much for aunswere to your demaunde: but now agayne that I haue tolde you that which you required, so I pray you tell me your name, and for what cause this cruell battayle hath bene foughte betwéene these Gyants and you. While the Knight of the Sunne spake thus, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> beheld him very sadly, and hearing him say that he was the Knight of the Sunne and that he knew no more of hys estate, he thought that peraduenture this same might be his brother of whome <name rend="roman">Artemidoro</name> had tolde him suche meru<unclear>a</unclear>yles, but leauing this suspicion til he might questi-

Your friendeshippe was great, and so I make reckning of it, otherwise I should not haue happened on so good a time to tell you my name in which biscause you woulde learne of mée, you shall vnderstande that my name is <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>, and that I was of good report in the court of kyng <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> the king of great <name rend="roman">Britaine</name> although my mishap causing it I doubt mee so much that my name is once mentioned amongest them, but that matter I will leaue off as not pertinent, this which you require aboute our fight sprong vppon thys occasion, and so hee shewed the whole order both of the receiuing of his <foreign lang="fr">Auant Cheualier</foreign> at the kyngs hands: the first dayes iusting: the second dayes combatte with <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name>: the honoure of the iustes: the enuye of <name rend="roman">Candramarte</name>: and poynt by poynte the whole story as you hearde before.</p><p>Which tale <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had scarsely finished, when the gentlewoman which all this whyle remayned in the ship cryed out, wherat they tourning their heads, saw in what manner she outraged saying.

There was a fence or closure made of tall high trées, some of them with so loftye toppes that it weryed him for to looke vpwardes.

The outward wall of the Castle was harde Marble hewed out of the Ilande <name rend="roman">Paros</name>, rounde aboute the Castell there was a déepe ditche with a deuyce, that albeit there was no springe in it to nourish it, yet was it mayntayned with a freshe flowe partly by the fall of waters from the mountaynes, partly by the ryuers we named amongest the meddowes, which at euery spring cléered the channell. Vppon this water there stode a bridge with thrée strong Turrets one in the beginning, the other in the middest, the other in the ende towards the Castle.

might be the house of his Gods, when they descended frō heauen to soiourne amongest vs. So very desirous to know the ende thereoff, he came vnto the bridge where he stayed a while ere he procéeded farther, for he iudged that according to the great strength of the archers, the depth of the water and the height of the wall, that no man might enter without leaue asked. And as he there wanted not matter or meruayle for the wonder of the castle, so meruayled hée that néere so rare &amp; mangificent buildings he met no person of whom he might demaunde to whom the fayre Castle did belong. Amid these thoughts it seemed best in his fancie to call to them within, if perhaps any would aunswere him, and therefore comming to the gates of the first turret which was then néerest to him he found a porch opened, and right before a faire stately court enclosed with walles of Jasper, and in the midst before him a payer of stayers of a x. or xij. degrées which ledde vp to a fayre piller, wherevnto was fastened with a chaine of golde, a fayre horne and a rich brawdricke to it. The horne was tipped all with golde, and in the ende were set many precious stones. The riches thereoff might haue contented a right couetous eye: vnderneth the horne vppon the same piller there were engrauen letters which the knight of the Sunne perceiuing and hoping there to learne some more newes he mounted vp the stayres and read as héereafter followeth.</p><q><p><hi rend="roman">¶ This Castle belongeth to the beautifull Lindaraza, the gates may not be opened to any saue to him which windeth the horne.

This beast was from the breast downeward as high as any man on horsebacke, and the tayle theroff was tenne paces in length, wherewyth he sweeped the grounde. Nowe the stronge Gyant comminge out of the gates let loose the Dragon and tooke the barre of yron in his handes paceing towardes the knight whiche was nowe in descending from the piller. Ere the knyght could easely come to the grounde the Gyant mette hym with a counterbuffe on the sheelde that he missed two or thrée steppes in comminge downe. The monsterous Dragon beneath was ready to receiue him. But the nephewe of <name rend="roman">Alicante</name> lightly estéemed all thus, and rather tooke courage in thys that there was some thinge worthy his paynes behinde when the Castell was kept by suche ougly porters, and drawinge out his swoorde hee stroke at the Serpent a blowe on the toppe of the head, but it dyd hym no more harme then if it had lyghted vppon a smythes an<unclear>st</unclear>elde, but it a little benummed his sences and beguyled him of his forehoped grype. Thys little harme which he had done to the Serpent dyd much amaze hym, and the better to saue hymselfe from the Serpente he got vnder the piller, and then hee bestowed an other blowe vppon the Serpents head with all his force. The Serpent so sore stricken waxed woode and brayed out so loude that all the courte range of the noyse, and faine would it haue got betweene the knight

The Gyant abode still at the stayers foote to waite for the knightes tombling on the stayers, at length he came downe headlong where the strong Gyant let driue at him so great a blowe with his barre that the barre burst and the good knight thought his head had bene brused, with this as well as he might, he rose vp, and driuing at the gyant he cut his legges cleane from his body. The Gyant falling to grounde, the Serpent raysing his tayle grasped at the knight of the Sunne, but I can not tell howe the knight escaped it, and withal he tooke vp the greatest péece of the barre of yron which the Gyant had, and hasting towarde the Serpent he gaue him such a blowe therewith vpon the head that hée fell downe, and before he could rise, the knight gaue him such an other that his scull as hard as flinte burst into two péeces, yet for al this y^e great Serpent was not throughly dead but bounded vp into the ayre, and swept the ground with his tayle seeming to be more fierce then at the beginning. The knight of the Sunne purposed to strike no more but quickly gate vp higher on the stayers to be out of daunger, in the ende the Dragon sturred nor more whereby he iudged that he was dead, and meruaylinge what besides this there might be found in the Castle, he hong the fayre horne about his necke, and with the bar in this hands he entered the first Tower, and from thence through the first arche of the bridge till he came to the second Tower which was the midst of the bridge, the gates whereoff were of steele &amp; shut as fast as y^e gates of y^e first arch were. <name rend="roman">Cheualiero del Febo</name> winded his horne and presently the gates were opened and there came issuing out a Gyant no lesse strong then the first, hauing in the one hand a clubbe, and in the other a chayne wherein he ledde a Lyon, the wightyest of lymme and byggest

The bodye as bigge as a Bull, and euery of his clawes was a handfull longe, his eyes shined lyke lampes.</p><p>This Lyon the Gyant untyed strayght and sette vppon the knight, which with no <sic>litte</sic> courage as he had a greater quest in hande awayted him, and at the firste blowe hee strake him so fell vppon the heade, that the braynes starte out, and the monsterous Lyon fell strarke deade without more sturring. When he had this done he encountred the Gyant, and the Gyant lette dryue at him: But the knight now minded at that time to assaye or put his trust to the fine mettall of his enchaunted helmette starte aside, that the clubbe fell vppon the brydge: but before the Gyant coulde reare his clubbe, the sonne of <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> hitte him so stronglye beneathe the knées that hys shinne bones were burst withall, and the Gyant wyth greate clamoures fell downe, the Knighte of the Sunne leauing him sure inough for making resistance tooke vp his heauye clubbe to go farther and to sée what was within.</p><p>This passed he through the seconde tower, till hee came to the thirde and last tower of the bridge, whereoff finding the gates shut as the other he wynded his horne, and with the shrylnesse thereoff the gates burst open making as great a noyse as if the bridge had rente in two presently stepped foorth a huge Gyant, nine foote in height all his bodye couered with a toughe hide so harde and strong that no sworde coulde enter at his wast he hadde a sword, and in his hand a chayne of yron whereto were fastened two Tygers of wonderfull greatnesse, by the fiercenesse of theire lookes able for to haue affrayed anye man.</p><p>For all this the hardy <name rend="roman">Grecian</name> was nothing appalled, for he lyfte vp the heauy club so stronge, as if the greate <name rend="roman">Hercules</name> shoulde haue come to fighte with him onelye with the showe it mighte haue made hym to tremble.

Those fierce beastes so soone as the Gyant had vnlosed them, opening their horrible mouthes, ranne with suche swiftnesse vpon him that it seemed their feete touched not the ground, at such time as they came both vppon him, he gaue one of them such a blowe vpon the shoulder that he burst all hys bones in peeces wherewith the Tyger fell to the grounde. Then came the other and caught holde of him in the shoulder so griping him that he coulde not stirre his arme, neither one way nor other, and grasping almost all the headpeece within his sharpe teeth he thougt to haue crushed it in peeces, but the helmet defended the head and the Magicke armour kepte of the tearinge of his nayles. Nowe the good knyght seeing neither purpose of hys clubbe nor vse of his swoord while he was thus entertayned by the Tyger throwinge away his clubbe, he strugled and wrastled so longe with the Tyger, that in the ende he cast the beast vppon the harde flinte stones with such a fall that the braynes flew out of the head. The wylde Gyant when he sawe the Tyger thus slayne, wiht an hellishe furye he went toward the knight of the Sunne, and takinge his longe swoorde he gaue him such a blowe vppon the toppe of the helmet that there sparckeled out great flakes of fire, and the knight fell vppon handes and knees. But as soone as he coulde, the knight recouering his swoorde requited him so couragiously, the Gyaunt beeinge vnarmed, that had not the stronge hide stoode him in steede of complete armour the swoorde had entered the fleshe, whereoff at this time it missed. Heereat the wilde Gyant taking vp agayne the heauie swoord stroke the knight of the Sunne vpon the toppe of hys headpeece, but he auoided the blow lightly. In such sort y^t the heauy swoord fel vpon y^e ground &amp; brake in peeces, the hilt<unclear>e</unclear> onely remaining in his hands. Now before y^e gyant could raise vp his swoord y^e knight of the Sunne had accōplished thus much of his purpose, he thought

there had bene no more to be done saue now to know the secrets which abode behinde, and wherefore this strayght warding was ordayned. Therefore he went throughe all the bridge vntill he came to a pathway which ledde betwéene the outwarde wall and the great Castle. When he had walked this path, about a bowe shotte off he saw a lyttle dore all engrauen with sundry kynde of portrayture, the straungenesse whereoff, with the varietie of the story wherein portrayed, might haue helde a good caruer a long time: the Imagery was so drawn that it would haue troubled the witte of <name rend="roman">Praxites</name> to haue matched it. The gates were not great, but the chiefe part was of stéele as surely closed as the first.</p><p>The Knight of the Sunne thinking that percase they woulde open at the first push rushed against them with all his force but his laboure was lost and hee preuayled no more then if hee woulde haue broken downe the walles with his féete. Therefore he winded his horne whereat the gates burst open but no man appeared without, saue that when he was about to enter he sawe two Gyantes the one of the one side and the other armed from top toe, with headepéeces of fine stéele, and their armoure a finger déepe in thickenesse they helde in their hands two battayle axes raysed vp aloft ready to discharge their blows vppon the commer in. The fiercenesse of their semblance was so straunge that it is harde to belieue that any man had the courage to enter a gaynst his will, but if it hadde bene the dogge <name rend="roman">Cerberus</name> he could not haue defended the passage.</p><p>This valyant knyght seing them in such sort prepared for the fight albeit he wanted not courage to assaye that fearefull entry, yet he stayed in doubte howe he mighte enter without daunger and warde the two first blowes. For to receiue both their blowes at once was not possible without great hazarde, and otherwise enter he could not, but after long pawsing he came nerer and as if he would

haue passed through he shewed himselfe, whereat the Gyants as if he had entred indéed let driue their blowes, the whilest the Knight stepte in betwéene them, and taking the nexte to hand he hit the one Gyant ouerthwart the pawnch, but his sworde entred not. The Gyantes which at their first blowes had broken their heauy clubs drewe out their broade arminge swordes, and layde at the Knight of the Sunne. The one hee receiued on the sworde, the other hee auoyded lyghtely by stepping aside. And willyng to see the ende of the aduenture he stroke on of them full vppon the visour wherewith he had thought to haue hewed his face, but he was deceiued, for it dyd the Gyant no more harme then if he hadde bene smitten with an hasill wande.</p><p>The Gyants nowe layde on loade, but he <sic>disappoynred</sic> them by y^e delyuernes of his body. And now consider what thought this good knight was in to féele himselfe assayled by two fierce enemyes &amp; not able to hurt againe. Neither was it possible to maister one of them by wrastlyng, for both the weaker of the two was to strong for him, and perhappes while he shoulde deale with the one, the other might displease him. So that neither of these wayes were conuenient, without some present helpe the daunger certeyne, yet in the ende he beganne to rebuke himselfe, euer sayng, Sticke to it, thou cowarde, and albeit as yet it séemes impossble for to escape this perillous skirmish, yet stirre not thy foote, either shalte thou soone ouercome or soone loose the victory, but neuer shalte thou lose thy infamy if thou dye flying, many times such hard aduentures haue bene occasion of greater glorye, and if any body but my selfe achieue it, I shall not lyke my self as long as I lyue<sic>,</sic></p><p>So gazing about to séeke aduauntages he marked the wickette standing open somewhat beneath the Porche where through he mighte well passe by lyttle boweynge himselfe, but neyther of the Gyantes mighte except they

fell on all foure, for they were higher then he by the brest downewarde, when he sawe this dore he bethought him selfe how to be out from the daunger of blowes which fell into his brayne at a time of néede. Thus it was as the Gyants were desirous to hitte him he euer stouped vnder and watchinge one of them, as hee was lyfting vp his armes, before the blowe could descende he ran and closed with him, and taking him by the gyrdell carryed him by strong hande and with all his force ranne agaynst the wickette that the Gyant not being able to passe through burst both heade and shoulders agaynst the wall, the Gyant there dyed in hys armour.</p><p>This done the strong knight passed farther, and letting the body fall with so muche spéede as hee might hee ranne to méete with the other Gyant, which then approched with his sworde in both his handes to haue smitten him. But these Gyants lyttle acquaynted with feates of armes, and the Knight of the Sunne by the dexterytye of his body defended himselfe lyghtly from them and obtayned victory.</p><p>For when the Gyant had lette his sworde fall out of his handes he embraced the Gyant with both his hands and tourning himselfe twice about at the thirde time hée lette him fall that through the wayghte of his body hys gall burst in his bodye, and he dyed presently. This meruaylous combat béeing ended, the good knight was now wery: and therefore tooke his ease vppon a seate of stone which was in the porch there to occupy himselfe he behelde the strong buyldings of the Castle. After roominge about to finde some other way to departe thence he found at one ende an other gate all of yron and the gates shutte as all the first, whereby he sawe that he had yet father tryall to abide.</p><p>And therefore he rested him selfe where he sate, after which done he arose and passing through the first wall to the seconde hee founde the gates shutte, and therefore

he winded his horne, presently the steele gates opened, and there came <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 word"/> thereoff a flame of fire accompanyed with great smoke as if it had bene some place of hell, vntill the smoke vanished awaye he could see nothing. After hée saw before y^e gate a beast in forme lyke a Crocodile but somewhat more hyd<unclear>eo</unclear>us, as it wer a mishapen monster purposed by nature to show the lothsomenesse of deformity. Out of his mouth he sent great flakes of fire, in the fangs ther <unclear>sate a tus<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter"/>e</unclear> without the mouth about halfe a yearde very sharpe and cutting.</p><p>The good knighte abashed nowe to sée so many fierce kéepers in that Castle as if it had ben nothing but a lodge of warders, (as he supposed) to kéepe in durance the sons of <name rend="roman">Titan</name> which once rebelled against <name rend="roman">Iupiter</name>. The which tale he had often heard in his Gentiles lawe, and yet the trauayle of conquering grieued him not alyke to the long looking for of the end but not minding to debate y^e matter at this time, he tooke his sworde in hys hande, assayinge the entry, but the ougly beast cast out suche a flash of fire that the Knighte of the Sunne lyttle lyked of it. And not being able to endure it, he gaue backe tyll the heat should slake.</p><p>This may a man say that it troubled the knight more then all that had passed, one cause was for the extremitye of heate, an other for that he sawe no waye to come nere the beast, for before he might approch it the beast woulde be all on a lyghte fire, but remembring himselfe of the club which he had lefte in the first entrye and thinking that it shoulde be the best weapon he might haue he ran to fetch it, and retourning spéedelye he founde the monster as you hearde before spitting his fire. The Knight of the Sunne with his long reach in his hand gaue the beast vppon the foreheade such a blowe, that the heade rent into two, and the terrible beast fell to grounde, beating his feet against the grounde so harde that it séemeed the Castle shooke with all, and the smoke which it sent foorth, as at the quenching

of a great fire so blinded the Knighte of the Sunne till it was starke dead that hee might not enter: from thence after he came to a faire courte the sumptuous buyldinge whereoff amazed him much, that in comparison the golden statues which <name rend="roman">Nero</name> the Emperour of <name rend="roman">Rome</name> erected might not more delyght him: no, nor yet the wonders of the worlde the stately <name rend="roman">Pyramides</name> of <name rend="roman">Aegypt</name>, wherein only their kings are buryed, and wherein they wasted the most part of their substance might lyke delyght them. In beholding the straungenesse of these buyldings I can not tell precisely his thought for euery circumstaunce, but if his thought were as my thought, or if the report be true which first came from him, surely ther was mater inough to gaze vppon, but what thincke you he noted especially? Nothing but a marble stone, but as it fell out to some good purpose.</p><p>In the marble stone were engrauen the valyant actes of all knights alyue or dead in such order of time as they lyued.

For albeit commonlye wee make much of our Elders vertues, it is but as commonly many things shew faier a far off whereas when they come to tryall they are but as ordinary.</p><p>After this hee mused in himselfe who that <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> might be for he neuer hearde of such a man: but by the draught of the picture he tooke him to be a comlye personage, of a milde and sadde countenaunce and it did him good to beholde him: so looking farther he saw the whole story of the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trabatio</name> drawen vnderneathe, from his first landing in <name rend="roman">Hungary</name> till that houre of hys enchauntment in that Castle. Nowe he was in the company of <name rend="roman">Lyndaraza</name> without knowledge of himselfe, or witting to his friendes. Now did he at length learne the purpose of the strong wardes which was to holde in the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> there beitched for the companye of <name rend="roman">Lyndaraza</name>, whome before he could restore to the knoweledge of himselfe, he must bringe from that péece of the Castell which was enchaunted to that onely effect. This when he vnderstoode it pitied him much that so good an Emperour shoulde there by in holde by false meanes to the great sorowe of his subiects and principally of his wife the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> whome he sawe lykewise all cladde in balcke lyke a widdow, and to worke some meanes of his deliuery, he looked about him which way was best to take, and lyking best one of the galloryes the which was néerest to the paued courte, that he followed mownting vp a paire of stayrs all made of Jasper in the midst wheroff he mette comming downe a bigge knight armed with rich and glistering armoure, his face bare and of a fresh colour, which approching to him drewe out his sworde, and without saying oughte, layde at the Knighte of the Sunne as fiercely as he could.</p><p>The knight of the Sunne woulde rather haue talked with him to haue learned some newes but it could not

be, so it behoued him to drawe his sworde and to defend himselfe. There beganne a whotte skirmishe that the clattering of their armoure and the flashinge of theire swordes range throughout the pallayce, This fury notwithstanding lasted not longe for the Knight of the Sun in a cholericke rage hitte his aduersary so sure vppon the toppe of his helmette that the bigge knighte fell downe and laye for dead.</p><p>The knighte of the Sunne stayed not to make dispatch of hym but rather hauing compassion on him (for he séemed a noble knight) he vnlaced the knights helmet to giue him ayre, but not being able then to recouer him, he passed farther and comming to the gallorye hee then went vp an other payre of stayres so wide and broad that if two were goyng vp néere the two endes, scarcelye the the one might knowe the other. Nowe in this his way albeit many things were which might haue stayed either as idell gazer or a curious eye, and manye thinges beside to haue inuited a weryed man to take his rest, yet the desire of finding the Emperour carryed his féete, and overcomming the paynes of the waye he came to a portall curiously wrought, to the entrye wheroff, there led thrée steps of beaten siluer. By them he entred into the great chamber where first Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> had a sighte of the faire and beautifull <name rend="roman">Lyndaraza</name> and was bereaued of his wittes.</p><p>In this chamber he was greatly abashed at the coste and workemanshippe of riche Tapestrye and other ornaments, and euer though the stuffe were of the costlyest, yet the workemanship bettered the matter. Hence must he as I tolde you conuaye the Emperour if hee meane to make himselfe known.

vertue that no enchauntment might preuayle agaynst it, by this he was bolde to enter the chamber, &amp; being within was frée the charme. Out of this chamber he came to the Orcharde wherevnto this chamber looked, so fresh and delectable that if euer pleasure might rauish the sences of man, a man might affirme it of that place. In the arbour neere the entry he sawe a number of faire gentlewomen clothed with silke, their breasts bare and white as snowe, some played on instrumentes and other sange swéetly to them.</p><p>Such kinde of Mermaydes woulde haue beguyled a well stayed <name rend="roman">Vlysses</name>, or such Musicions aswell for theire cunning song as their company, woulde haue broughte a watchefull <name rend="roman"><corr>A</corr>rgus</name> to a sléepy heade.

vyolence was offered, but she replyed wyth teares, saying. Alas my Lord I shall dye vnlesse you do iustice on this knight which hath here entered without my leaue, &amp; which hath interrupted our ioyes by the destroying of my kéepers. Heerewith the Emperour very angry spake to the knight, saying. Sir knight why haue you come within this place without the lisence of this lady, it being hirs &amp; kept by strong keepers for hir vse. The knight of the Sunne gently aunswered. Noble Emperour I confesse I demaunded no leaue, &amp; till now I met with none which would aske wherefore I came, but my arrant is for your selfe which heere liue vnknowen, &amp; haue forgotten your wyfe and Empire. The Emperour angerly replyed: neyther thou nor the whole world may bring me hence, &amp; for thy good zeale to put me from my ioy, stay awhile and I will acquite thee thy fee. So hastely he flang to a chamber where he armed himselfe, the while that <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> whom it touched as in especiall reuiled the knight of the Sunne for his thether comming. O saith she, thou saucie and vnmannerly knight howe hast thou had the face to enter my castle in despight of my porters, either departe hence quickly or tarry to abide the Emperours puissance. And if my minde deceiue me not I shall soone be satisfied for this disgrace. The knight of the Sun knowing how grieuous it would be vnto hir that the Emperour should leaue hir layd contrarywise w^t faire woords to perswade hir to giue consent to his departure, saying: Worthy lady may you not content your selfe with so many years in which you haue detained this noble &amp; famous Emperour: both from wife &amp; kindred, from land &amp; subiect, but wil you also for your pleasure, neither lasting nor honest vndoe a whole countrey, &amp; take a man from his wife which hath mourned for him xx. years. I beseech you madame contēt your selfe with y^t which is past and let him not wade farther in this errour which if it may plese you to remoue to your great honour at my entreatie. Hereat <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name><pb n="290" ed="digital" entity="13801:121" pages="146"/><milestone n="[146L]     The Myrrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
all <unclear>flr</unclear>ie could not abide the end of his sute, but with great outcries in insence y^e poore emperour, she put him off. The Emperour béeing armed, in great choller ranne vpon the knight of the Sunne, &amp; without saying any thing laide at him with all his force. The knight of the Sun knowing that what y^e Emperour did, was but as done in a dreame, would not strike him to do him harme, but onely to saue himselfe &amp; to finde the meanes whereby to bring <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> from that enchauntment. Therevpon by little &amp; little he gaue back, that the Emperour following him, he might in the end bring him frō the inchaūted chamber. This came to passe accordinly, for as he made show of lacke of resistance, so y^e emperour thinking to follow the aduauntage pursued him to the great chamber wher the enchauntmēt first tooke effect. In short by this foresaid meanes ther also this emperour was brought to the point of auoiding the chamber, whereat <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> fearing least he might be led cryed w^t a loude voice. Stay, stay, my lord, for this knight is full of falshood, and if you go out of this chamber both you &amp; I shall dye. Héereat the Emperour who was not desirous of any thing but to please hir retourned backe. The knight of y^e Sun would not follow him, but stil kept at the pitch of the entry, &amp; the Emperour would not come to him for feare of <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name>.</p><p>Well, this deuise not succéeding the knight of y^e Sun thought now to try if he might carry him by maine force. This he knew woulde be a daungerous matter for the courage which he knewe in the Emperour, but all was well employed if he might set him at liberie. So towardes the Emperour he goeth, whome not prepared to fight, he sodeinly catcheth in his armes and with a lusty courage raiseth him from ground to haue carryed him away, but before the knight might get to the doore y^e Emperour catching holde likewise held the knight so shorte that for a while they tumbled in the hall, neyther parte gayning any great scantling of grounde, but the ods was

the knightes, &amp; in the ende he quickly lifting vp the Emperour would he or not, he brought him without y^e chamber. The Emperour strugled to recouer the doore, but in their strugling they both tumbled downe the stayers. Nowe hath the knight of the Sunne played the man, for ere they came fuly to the ground the doores of the inchaunted chamber clapt together, wherewith and wyth the noyse thereoff a great part of the edifices sanke withall. The Emperour retourned to his former wittes presently sawe that he thought he had not stayed there past a day, and that which passed betwéene him and <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> had bene but a short and pleasaunt dreame. After calling to minde his wife the faire Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name> &amp; the great hoast which he had left before <name rend="roman">Belgrado</name> he became so sorrowfull that the teares trickled downe his cheekes in great measure. But of this manner and condition are we mortall men, that for our pleasures we sometimes forget our spouses the one halfe of our selues:sometimes neglect our children the more halfe of our selues: (as in whom the hope of posteritie resteth) and lastly sometimes we ouertourne our countrey which ought to be déerer to vs then our selues, neyther mindefull to what vse wée are created, namely to the benefite of others, neyther carefull what losse ensueth, as in especiall our owne discommoditie, but that which is more then carelesse, is the little thought of chaunge, and the lothinge to depart from it.</p><p>That when we are at our wayes ende wée séeme but as it were nowe to begin a freshe: It is like a swéete sléepe, but let vs shake off thys drousie humoure, and let vs open our sleepy eyes. Let vs vse our selues so that sometimes we haue recourse to matters of more importaunce, and to thincke of heauen, to despise the vayne temporall thinges of this world, to seperate our selues from the man of felshe, and willingly to leaue him least he leaueth vs against our willes.</p><pb n="292" ed="digital" entity="13801:122" pages="147"/><milestone n="[147L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><p>Little shall remaine thereoff after scores of yeares, &amp; that which remaineth shalbe shame &amp; griefe for the life passed, besides desperate repentaunce which is a double torment. And much after this same manner was this valyant Emperour for his long delights with <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name>, now xx. yer<unclear>e</unclear> was but a Summers day, &amp; yet there left him not shame of his fact to fret his conscience, albeit he aduised himselfe the best remedy which I haue read off which is amendement of life, the safest hauen for a weatherbeaten penitent. First therefore knowing that this knight was hee which had as it were awaked him from his dreame, he pulled off his helmet &amp; embraced him, giuing harty thanks for his deliueraunce. Withall, professing that he thought himselfe vnable to requite that great courtesy, yea, euen with the bestowing of his Empire, so assuredly hee ment not to forget it, if peraduenture God would shewe hym the occasion of dooing him seruice. For (saith he) you haue not saued my life, here might I haue liued without daunger of swoord, but you haue saued my soule .&amp;c. Extolling the greatnesse of the benefit, &amp; in the ende, he prayed him of courtesie to tell him his name and countrey with the cause of his comming to that Iland. The knight of the Sun answered him gently. Valiaunt emperour y^e thing which I haue done in your seruice is not like to y^t which I wish for, as your valour forceth my will, so my wil sueth a desert on your part, more vnto you then to all the knights of the world. But wit you I am called y^e knight of the Sunne, my countrey I know not, but my bringing vp hath ben in <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, where I was tolde y^t I was foūd vpō y^e sea, being a very child, my cōming to this castle was by chaunce, my boat being driuen by tempest vpon y^e shore wher séeing it so fresh &amp; faire I had desire to know y^e owners, &amp; fortune being fauourable, I passed through al killing y^e kéepers till I came within this court where I saw engrauen your whole history frō y^e time y^t you wer married with y^e princes <name rend="roman">Briana</name> til time you were brought hether.

There knewe I the manner of your bewitching, &amp; albeit your selfe were vnknown to me, yet I thought I would set you frée if that I might, from whence thys hath procéeded which you haue séene. When he had ended the Emperour embraced him many times with greate pleasure as well wondring at his greate prowesse, for he could not be ignoraunt of <name rend="roman">Lindarazas</name> power, as also at hys boldnesse for a matter not touching hym in any respecte by all appearaunce. For he neither knewe countrey nor parents. But as the remembraunce of his wyfe &amp; Empryre caused in the Emperour much griefe, so he besought the knight of the Sunne that they might departe from thence to goe into <name rend="roman">Greece</name> where he might better thancke him then he had earst done. The knight of y^e Sun with a good affection to beare him company condescended easily rather yet vpon desire to know the countrey wherin he had heard to be right valiant knightes, then of any hope of reward. So when they came néere the outward court they found that knight (whome the knight of the Sunne had left in a traunce) nowe retourned to himselfe and vpon his féet safe and sound. The knight when he sawe the Emperour and the knight of the Sunne cōming downe, giuing great sighes and wéeping bitterly began to say. Oh what a dismall day is this for me, now my sister <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> is dead and I haue lost a swéete companion, I would rather that I had bene killed by this straunger which hath destroyed all our good, then that I shoulde liue and susteyne such anguish. Little haue the monsterous keepers preuayled whome we put in our Castle to defende hir lyfe, and to defende the death which so sodeynly hath taken hir away. The Emperour hearinge him and knowing him ran to embrace him, saying. My déere friend <name rend="roman">Flamides</name> howe chaunceth this heauinesse in your countenaunce? Why doe you fetch such deepe sighs and spill so many teares with so great sobbes. If it be for my departure and for the libertie which you haue

receiued by this knight, you know how long time I haue héere remained out of my remembraunce, and forgetfull of my Empire and kingdome, and shall I not go to comfort hir which long time by my absence hath bene comfortlesse. My Lorde sayde <name rend="roman">Flamides</name>, I can not denye but your reason is good, and that the iniurie hath bene great in detayning you so long from thence, but as your excellencie knoweth there is no loue more naturall then betwéene brother and sister. O the death of my sister <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> pearceth me to the heart, and I had rather then my life haue accompanied hir in death, then thus to bewayle hir lacke after death. For so soone as you came out of the inchaunted roome, my sister dyed presently, so was it appointed by y^e destinies, that no longer then she should enioye your presence she should liue. Blessed man, sayde the Emperour, &amp; is <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> dead, yea assuredly quoth he. Now on my honour (sayd the Emperour) hir death grieueth me, and during my life shall I be sad as oft as I shall call hir to remēbraunce, &amp; although my case is such as in more néede of comfort then likely to comfort others, yet me thinckes I may tel you that you ought not to bewaile hir death so much, for belike a long time haue you knowē y^t hir life should not last after my departure. Now wherefore do you lamenet hir so sore as if it were but now thought on &amp; not before foreséene. Againe your ouermuch carefulnes in fortifying your castle was but néedlesse, for it is giuen to man to haue y^e mastery ouer beaste which either by Art or Nature become tractable. And be it your castle had bene inexpugnable for all men in y^e world, yet what fence had you to shut out death. A man in no place can warrant himselfe such safetie as that at euery step he draweth himselfe néerer vnto death. Whether we be frée or bond, on foot or horseback, sléeping or waking, whole or sick, we dayly draw nere vnto our end: or if you wil speak more truely to our perfection, for then man beginneth to liue in déede when he goeth out of this miserable world.

Your reason satisfieth my vnderstanding, &amp; I confesse it true that we ought not to wéepe when death assaileth vs, neither ought we to make straunge of it, for in the end we must leaue this world, &amp; then is there nothing more certeine, but my conceit builded vpon outward sence béeing contrary to reason troubleth againe that part where affections are &amp; maketh it rebellious, and howsoeuer men be prouided for death by continuall thought that they muste dye: ordinarily notwithstanding we thincke our selues immortall till death attacheth vs. And what olde man onely for age is so féeble that he hopeth not for a day to liue: But as to <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> my sister, I beléeue that although you had stayed here many dayes, the secret of this aduenture had neuer bene disclosed vnto you, neither do you knowe the cause why you were brought &amp; put héere. But I will tell you plainly. My sister <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> &amp; I had both one father named <name rend="roman">Palisteo</name> being the second son to y^e king of <name rend="roman">Phrygia</name>, my father not being borne to the kingdome fell rather to seke his owne delight without enuy, then to trouble him selfe with the care of gouerning. Aboue all he studied the Arte Magicke, where by his paines at length came to the most absolute perfection of all in <name rend="roman">Asia</name>, he was matched wyth a Lady of high parentage, by whome he had two children, my sister <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> and me, wee were of young yeares when our mother dyed in labour of y^e third child, so ther remained none else but our father aliue, &amp; louing to be solitarie came &amp; dwelled in this Iland, bringing w^t him my sister &amp; those waiting women

which you haue séene, by his greate skill he buylded thys Castle, heere he lyued vntill my sister and I were of some discretion to guyde our selues. Héere he drewe many histories of thinges passed in the worlde, and among other the picutres of many valiant knightes which were thē on liue, with the rest you were so liuely drawen that it happening my sister to enter one day where y^e Imagery was, by the sight of your picture she was surprised with your loue. Our father <name rend="roman">Palisteo</name> knowing hir disease deuised you should be brought by following your owne wife carried from you. For this cause was this enchauntment made in that quarter of the castle wherein you abode without making your selfe priuie to your owne estate that if your knights came to séeke you they might not perswade you hence, neither could euer perswasion haue serued, onely force which this man hath vsed. When the wise man our father had done all this, he declared vnto vs the secretes of these thinges, and farther tolde vs by his Arte that the time should come when you should be deliuered from the enchauntment, although he knewe not when nor in what manner. He tolde vs that at such time as you should bée at large, my sister <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> should dye, either for the griefe that she should conceiue, or for that the fates had so appointed. Moreouer that you shoulde haue a daughter by hir which might not hence depart till ther should come a knight which should winne the entries once againe, &amp; after marry hir. Of this knight he said that there should spring the race, whence issueth y^e two noble families much spoken off throughout the world, the one house to be called <name rend="roman">Mongrana</name>, y^e other <name rend="roman">Claramonte</name>, me he charged not to leaue the Castle till my néece <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> should be acquited. After this, out father <name rend="roman">Palisteo</name> béeing sore sicke dyed, since his death hitherto euery thing hath fallen out accordingly. And thus you haue heard the whole processe of my tale, and the cause why your daughter <name rend="roman">Lindaraza</name> can not goe from hence at this time.</p><pb n="297" ed="digital" entity="13801:124" pages="149"/><milestone n="142 [149]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/><p>The Emperour and the knight of the Sunne had very attentiuely lystened to all that which <name rend="roman">Flamides</name> had spoken: and albeit the Emperour was desirous to carry his daughter <name rend="roman">Lyndaraza</name> with him, he could not yet refuse to leaue hir when he coulde not otherwise chuse, and he besought <name rend="roman">Flamides</name> that at such time as they came both out that they should take the way to <name rend="roman">Greece</name> there to reioyce with him.

In this manner the father and the sonne trauayled running ouer in their discourse straunge thinges of the enchaunted Castle, till that they approched the mayne sea wheras yet the lyttle boate stoode in which the Knighte of the Sunne had come thether. Now for that along the shore there were no more boats, the Emperour was somewhat sorrowfull seeming to him that hee was ill furnished to go whether he purposed, and telling it to the Knighte of the Sunne. The knight of the Sunne aunswered. My Lorde I pray you be not agrieued with this, for the boat is guyded by a wise man a friende of mine, one as I beléeue so carefull to carry me hence, as he hath friendelye sent me to worke your delyueraunce. Besides, this boate will holde vs both, and if it be so you will vouchsafe my shippe you shall neuer sayle more safe neither better prouided for victualls.

God be praysed sayd the Princesse for the names of so high Princes oughte not to be concealed, especially héere where the Emperour my Father would be glad of such knights for the honour which his court should receiue thereby, and I for my part would thinke it a great courtesie in you, if you would stay héere till I were knighted<sic>.</sic> for by such noble Princes might I be honoured.

Yea but so are not we sayd the gentlewomē shall we say they venture imprisonment vpon our knights and they lose nothing, they may betray vs if they wyll, but we feare rather that it will not be in theire power.

And when al things wer in readines, one night secretly they cōuaied thēselues out of y^e citie &amp; so straight to y^e sea side where they entered into a ship prouided for that purpose, &amp; hoising vp sailes they were carried, they neither knew nor cared whether, for the courages of these two princes resolued to y^e search of worthy aduentures would not let them be quiet, so y^t any thing might better content their ease at home. But as soone as they were gone the wise <name rend="roman">Lyrgandeo</name> knew of it, and waying the great commoditie which might ensue thereoff to themselues &amp; others, he would not hinder it, nor it make as if he knew it, yet had he gret care to guide their ship wherein they sailed, &amp; they reached thether in .xv dayes which to other is an ordinary monethes sayling.

rently appeased. Now all matters quieted in <name rend="roman">Persia</name> for y^e princes absence, we may the fréelier beare y^e knights company which are yet sailing on the sea, so y^t the xv. day after they were departed from <name rend="roman">Persia</name>, they landed in a hauē of <name rend="roman">Polonia</name> where their ship stood stil, &amp; taking land to learne some newes &amp; know the country ere they had long trauailed they saw before them a little towne to their iudgemēt pleasant, &amp; round about great flocks of men &amp; women scattered, &amp; making great cries as if some great mischaunce had happened to them. <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> demaūded of them the cause of their sorrow, whereto an auncient man amonge them answered, y^t a fierce gyant w^t more thē fiftie knights had come this morning vpon thē to steale away y^e princesse <name rend="roman">Clarinea</name> daughter to the king of <name rend="roman">Polonia</name> their liege lord, y^t he had killed the greater number, &amp; spoiled the residue. And as he thought was ere this time on his way with y^e princesse in his carriage, from whom if it so be not all the world may recouer hir? why so said <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> &amp; where is y^e king, or where are his knights y^t they do not defend their lady. The olde man answered, they are in a town iiij. mile off, not mindeful of any such matter &amp; it hath not ben past viij. daies since y^e princesse came to this towne, &amp; now this which you haue heard hath happened to hir: when y^e three knights heard this of y^e olde mans relacion, w^tout staying longer they galloped w^t their horses so fast as they might, &amp; comming néere to y^e towne they saw issuing out of the gates a great troup of knights, y^e ere part driuing y^e other before it. For so it was y^t the gyant hauing the princesse in his power was carying hir away &amp; y^e townsmen fought with him, but their power little preuailed, the gyant was strong, his knights many, &amp; so they murdered al y^t came, in such sort y^t the town dwellers fled: then came y^e other knightes which slew many of them.

riddaunce of these thrée, he tooke no more kéepe but rode away softly with the princesse. The princesse cried out so loud y^t it was great pitie to heare hir, &amp; those which heard hir of hir own knights, came pitifully crying to y^e knights straungers y^t for the honour of god they should go help hir. When this was spoke, <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> besought his companions to stay ther in y^e battail, &amp; to giue him leue to follow y^e gyant, which whē they graunted him, he putting the spurs to his horse followed the trace, the whiles the knights of <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name> throughly galded their enimies. For y^e one of thē matchable I dare auouch with y^e auncient <name rend="roman">Franconio</name> the <name rend="roman">Troyans</name> sonne, of whom he descended: for he putting himselfe in prease among them, to some claue their heads, to other some their sheelds murdering many &amp; felling many, y^t at length there was none so hardy which durst stand him a blow, but euery of thē did his best to saue one. His vnckle <name rend="roman">Armineo</name> in y^e broile helped not a little, for he was a valiant knight &amp; much esteemed off in <name rend="roman">Fraunce</name>. But let vs leaue them &amp; speake of the prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> who pursued the Gyant. He rode so fast that ere the gyant came within a flight shot of y^e sea, he ouertoke in a large plaine &amp; crying aloud bad him redeliuer y^e princes false faytour as he was. The gyant loked back to se what he was, &amp; seeing but one though riding in hast he cared not for him, saue y^t not to be foūd vnprouided, he losed y^e princes frō betwéene his armes &amp; set hir on groūd: y^e prince cōming to him spake neuer a woord, but drawing his sword hit him so great a blow vpon y^e helmet y^t he made him boowe his head to his brest, wherwith y^e gyant encreased in choller &amp; gaue him y^e like: this begā y^e skirmish between thē wherein y^e noise was so great y^t y^e princesse <name rend="roman">Clarinea</name> before in a sound retourned to hir selfe, &amp; seeing y^e battaile with so little hope as y^e one onely knight should aduenture hir deliuerance, fell into a sound again, wherein she had dyed for sorrow had not god prouided hir y^e means she looked not for, &amp; the comfort she hoped not: &amp; she was y^e rest of y^e battaile a ioyful beholder.

Whē they had thus fought an houre, it was a wōde: to se their brused armour w^t their hacked shieldes, but euer y^e stéele coate defended the biting of their swoordes, especially <name rend="roman">Brandizels</name>, which made by Art Margicke had this vertue that no mettalle might pearce it. The Gyant was hurt in many places, whereat as at the force of his aduersary he was greatly estonished &amp; blasphemed his gods in desperate manner which had made him stay that good knightes comming. The Princesse <name rend="roman">Clarinea</name> séeing the Gyantes bloud thus couer the ground, was very glad &amp; hir colour became fresh which much encreased hir beautie whereto also (Fortune willinge to be fauourable) it was so that the Prince <name rend="roman">Brandizel</name> beholding hir was enamored of hir beautie and entierly loued hir. For his heart nowe set on fire augmented his courage, and he buffeted y^e Gyant, so that in short time he vnarmed hym in many places. In the ende the Prince desirous to gyue end to y^e battaile, raysed in his styroppes, stroke a full blowe at the Gyant vpon the shoulder that his swoorde entered a handfull and the gyant fell dead. The Prince séeinge him fall, presently leaped from his horse and pulling off his helmet went to the Princesse to recōfort hir, sayinge. Madame I beséech you accept in good part this little seruice at his handes which desireth to do you much more.

I shal not be able to requite it you, but if you wil y^t this good which haue done me do like me in déed, shew me so much fauour as to cary me to y^e king my father, for hither wil come y^e residue of y^e gyants knights, &amp; thē my liberty is to begin again: y^e prince gently taking both hir handes in his, kissed them &amp; said vnto hir.

I left my companions fighting with thē, who I am sure haue done their parts, and yet they shall do vs no wrong though they be many. But in far greater ieopardy am I of my life by you, if you vouchsafe me not your seruice, wherwith y^e princesse was nothing offended for she liked very wel his comedly personage, but she answered nothing.

Now retourned he to <name rend="roman">Arguirosas</name> shippe wherin she with the olde man receyued him, <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> salutacion to the Princesse after this exployt was in this wise.

Now when <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had so sayd the Princes and y^e olde man sta<unclear>r</unclear>ed a good while without speking word for the consideration of their owne daunger, past recouery if this man fayled, made them the more wary, and so betwéene the examination of <name rend="roman">Rolandos</name> valour and <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> hardinesse.

To which deuice after he had made them priuie, and promised that they shoulde not be disclosed till it so serued for their auayle, they were better comforted, and sailed with so good winde that they tooke landing in a hauen neere the place where the king was, taking lande he made the Princesse to put on a muffler, &amp; the olde knight to couer his heade, besides bidding both to counterfayte for the tyme some straunge behauiour either in holdyng downe theire heades or in disguysing their attyre. To either of them he gaue their horse, and himselfe mounted vppon a courser the best of all <name rend="roman">Candramartes</name> stable. In the coole of the evening they tooke their waye to the néerest Citie, where then were many knightes and Ladyes comming out of the Citie to disporte them in the shadowe. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> being of a comly personage and so lustely mounted praunced forth to be séene, and was well lyked off and praysed amongst them all. As they followed on their iourney toward the gates of the Citie, the king at y^e time came out accōpanyed with his nobilitye to solace himselfe in the fielde as at other times before hee was accustomed. The king rode vpon a mightie horse, with trappings and harnesse most of beaten golde, hys borse being so braue and himselfe so fierce and sterne to looke to that it would haue daunted a right good knighte to haue but spoke to him. So soone as the Princesse, and hir vnckle saw him, they counterfayted the best that they could, and for feare their blood sonke down into their bellies. The valyant <name rend="roman">Greeke</name> knowing that this was <name rend="roman">Rolando</name> whome he sought for, as nothing afrayd of his terrible lookes, but rather glad to haue met with him so conueniently, &amp; in the company of so many knights, willed the Princesse &amp; the knight to follow him. So came they al iij. before the king, <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> speaking to him &amp; saying.

for that thou art the king and shouldst aboue all men repulse the wrong doer, (so further discouering of the kings duety.) Now the while <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> spake thus, <name rend="roman">Rolando</name> behelde him very well, lyking both his courage and personage, and albeit of his owne nature he neither feared God nor kept iustice in things which perteyned to hymselfe, yet hearing in <name rend="roman">Rosicleers</name> discourse, himselfe to bee made on now and then as of a ryghte Judge, and that he woulde not consent to that other then iustice should be executed in his kingdome, he was tickeled therwith, and badde <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> tell on, for hee woulde heare his matter willyngly. <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> strayning his voyce, that what hee sayde might be hearde and noysed abroade, spake as followeth.</p><p>Knowe you mightie king that the father of thys gentlewoman was Lorde of a great possessions, which marrying with an honourable woman begatte on hir this Lady.

But it was the kinge hath spoken it sayde <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name>. And know for truth that the knight which hath done this iniurye is thy selfe: the gentlewoman which receiued it is the Princesse <name rend="roman">Arguirosa</name> which heere standeth by me the lawfull enheritour as thy selfe knoweth of this kingedome: thou without iuste title hast intruded vppon it: therefore doe that which thy mouth hath witnessed to be iust. When <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> had sayd, <name rend="roman">Rolando</name> much amased at his greate presumption, and not beinge able to bridle his choller aunswered despitefully.</p><p>Thou foolish &amp; vnhappy knight, how hath so great madnes entred into thee, as to appeare before me with such a demaunde, that were it not for the sentence which I haue giuen, I would ere this haue abated thy pryde: but I will not keepe long from thee the rod of due correction, I am content to take the battayle, and with the condicions which thou hast named harde enough I warrant thee for thy selfe and that woman whome I will so cage vp that she shall no more seeke such knights as thou art.

But you carrie hir not away, sayde the Emperour, for sooner shall you die then touch hir honour.

For the Emperour albeit very inclinable to any reasonable pitie, yet was in this poynt very rigorous, not to spare the dishonourers of virginitie, his saying was, that it quenched the naturall loue betweene father and mother, sister and brother, betweene kiffe and kinne: that the bastard broo<unclear>d</unclear>e seldome came to good purpose: that it was partly the sinne of <name rend="roman">Sodomy</name>, &amp;c.

That you go secretly to the monasterie and carry away the Princesse from thence, scarce letting hir selfe know whether you shall go, saue that behinde you you may leaue a letter which shall signifie the whole effect of that which is passed.

So it is that my sister and hée haue bene marryed eyghte yeares and haue had no children, wherefore he fearinge y^t after hir decease the Dukedome should retourne to hyr kinne, as by right it <unclear>w</unclear>ould being hir onely enheritaunce, and minding to establish the state in his owne name, hath suborned a desperate person to challenge hir of adultery. By which meanes she being executed as false to hir husbande all hir lands and goods are forfayted to the husband as it were to make him amendes of his wiues wronge.

For there is a knight in the lande called <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> Lord of y^e blacke wood by reporte y^e strongest knight which euer was in these parts, albeit very lyke vnto the Duke in his ill lyuing, him hath the Duke made hys friende and accuser of the Princesse.

The Emperour lyked well of <name rend="roman">Clandestrias</name> speach, and so he stayed in a place which she prouided for him, the whilest that the gentlewomen went to the Princesse. Some will thinke that the Emperour shoulde be much chaunged this being the xx. yeare of his absence, but it was not so, for when he first <sic>enrred</sic> the Castle of <name rend="roman">Lyndaraza</name> he was but xxxv. yeares in age, and no more was he when he came from the enchauntment, neither his age encreasing, nor his beautie decreasing. When the Emperour lefte the Princesse <name rend="roman">Briana</name>, she was but xiiii. yeares olde, and counting the time that she had liued afterward she was iust one yere vnder him wherein hir beautie best appeared, and the great sorrowe which she before had taken did not so abate hir coloure, but that the ioy of his retourne fetched it agayne more fresh and lyuely then it was before.</p><p>But the story saith that the gentlewomen found their mistresse alone prayinge deuoutlye vppon hir knées, and more merry then she was before, whether by inspiration or by immagination, conceiuing hope in the dreame I tolde you off: but hir gentlewomen were very gladde to be witnesses of hir mirth.

For why didst thou not bringe him before me that my selfe might haue hearde it of his owne mouth, would it not then haue bene pleasaunt vnto me to haue séene that knighte which so lately sawe my louing husband: and to haue knowen of him in what manner he mette with him, and for what cause he commeth not so soone as the other.</p><p>Madame be not agrieued with this sayde <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> for the knight which tolde it me is not so farre hence but that within a quarter of an houre you may sée him if you haue desire thereto.

The Princesse was somewhat afrayde to sée so bygge a man all armed, but the Emperour pullinge off hys helmette quickly shewed hys louely face, the whiche shee had imprinted in hir remembraunce. And wyth hasty paces hée made towardes the Princesse, whome hée kyssed on the mouth so swéetly that their tongues this while were slent, not to interrupt the ioye of theyr first méeting. Anone after the Princesse whiche in déede had the chiefest wrong spake to the Emperour thus:</p><p>My Lorde and onely lyfe what cruell Fortune hath detayned you from this lande, and bannished you so long from my presence. In what straunge and hydden countryes haue you bene that we coulde neuer heare woorde of you.

The Emperour courteously thanckinge hir, badde hyr saye on what had happened, whereat she graciouslye blussinge, tolde him that she had bene deliuered of two children at one burthen béeing two goodly boyes with straunge markes in their bodies.

Gentlewoman if your businesse had bene so great to the court as you woulde haue vs thincke, you would not haue stayed for so small a matter. The gentlewoman very angry replyed shortly. Call you it so small a matter, marke what I saye, you are not so courteous as I tooke you for, if you so little estéeme womens sutes, you béeing a knight, nowe know you that a woman estemeth hir beautie aboue al, and that there is no iniury so great for a woman, as to say that an other is fayrer then shee: I tell you that I had rather be called any other name of reproch, then not a well fauourd woman, and beeing as I am I account my selfe much fairer then <name rend="roman">Albamyra</name>, or rather would I all my greate businesse vndone, then to confesse that which the knyght of the bridge doth will me too.

and she bad them aloude to remember the comparison of <name rend="roman">Albamiras</name> beautie &amp; hirs, from this time she liked much better of hir selfe, but age comming vpon hir, hir beautie decayed, as there is nothing more vncertayne, either empayred by sicknesse, or withered by age, or by sundry accidents in mannes lyfe corrupted and depraued, and what should I talke of the harme that thence issueth. It is at home a bréeder of vnrest, a robber of ease abroade, a continuall care, a cause of many daungers, a sea of trauayles, and an euerlasting griefe whether comminge or goinge: but what néedeth this so long a digression, the rest let vs leaue to those that are ydle, to discourse at leysure, nowe more at large of our necessary matter.

Now at the comming in of this knighte with the deuice of the Sunne there was sodainly a great silence belyke by occasion of some in the company which had seene his valour proued vppon <name rend="roman">Florinaldes</name>. And the Knight of the Sunne glad of such cōuenient time of hearing, after he had humbly bowed to the king, spake as followeth. Mightie king I am a knighte and a straunger neither of your courte, countrey, nor relygion: but Fortune casting me vppon this coast, it was my chaunce to méete with this gentlewoman, sister to the Duchesse of <name rend="roman">Pannonia</name>, whom you holde prisoner. This gentlewoman trauayled to séeke a knight which woulde aunswere the accusation that the Duke hir husband layeth agaynst hir, and lyghting vpon me she hath opened to me the whole trechery and packing of the Duke hir husbande with the periured <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> of the blacke woode. In the iustif<unclear>i</unclear>yng of which woordes spoken by the gentlewoman, and the improuing of <name rend="roman">Arydons</name> false and shamelesse slaunder, I am hether come to proue that he belyeth the Duchesse vppon his body. The king now and all which were present beheld the Knight of the Sunne very earnestly, and were abashed to sée him being so young to speake so couragiously. <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> verye angry rose vp, and to the Knight of the Sunne spake on this wise. Sir knight it appeares that thou art bothe young and a straunger in this countrey, for if thou werte of yeares or knewest <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> which nowe talketh wyth thée, thou wouldst not be so hardy as to defie him in presence, and were it not for the King my Lorde I woulde in some wise tell thée of thy rudenesse, but there néedeth no such hast, I hope I shall haue time inoughe sith thou canst not detract the battayle whereto thy selfe hath first made offer, but lette vs to go to it presently and ende it in this place. <name rend="roman">Arydons</name> highe disdayne sore displeased the Knight of the Sunne as appeared by his looke, but he refrayned for honour to the king, and for the rest he desired

The king aunswered him gently that daye it mighte not be, both for that it was néedefull the Duchesse of <name rend="roman">Pannonia</name> should appeare openly to put hir quarrell into his handes, and for that also Judges must be ordayned of the fielde, and the lysts erected: which coulde not be prouided in so shorte warning. The knight of the Sunne yelded to the kinges pleasure, and after that he had witnessed his forwardenesse to defende the Duchesse, hee toke his leaue of the king and to his host he goeth. The king as soone as he was gone, but occasion of this young knight, calling to minde his sonne <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> whome he had not hearde off in long tyme, wept bitterly and sayd a loude that diuers hearde it. If my sonne <name rend="roman">Liriamandro</name> be lyke to this lusty knighte, and haue a care to be notable, no doubt he will excell all his auncestors. Whereat those which were there by declared to the king what themselues had séene of this knight and howe strongly hee had ouerthrowen <name rend="roman">Florinaldes</name>: which report did in a manner discomfit <name rend="roman">Arydon</name>, that he would haue wished his stake out at y^e dealing with all his heart, but in déede a very desperate contempt both of God and the worlde brought him to his ende.</p></div><div id="mirrour056" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The battaile betweene the Knight of the Sunne and the strong Arydon.

Thou O God as I beleeue hast sent this young man from heauen to reuenge my misreport, otherwyse who is <sic>his hee</sic> in this worlde which mighte haue sate so quiet in his saddel after so violent a push as I haue giuen him, or who might haue annoyed <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> so, and with a deperate rage he drew his sworde to haue sheathed it in the knights horse bellye, but y^e knighte descended &amp; with hys sworde before him went toward <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> y^t betwéene them the battayle beginneth. The king and the Princes ther present were very glad to see so good a beginning of the Duchesse delyuerance. And <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> fayled not to do his best, that the knight of y^e Sun could not bust take him for a strong knight, the battaile endured a great while no man being able to iudge who had y^e better, til y^e knight of y^e Suns courage grew as his honour encreased for he was not angred at the first. The ende of this battayle

(for it was not long neither very equall) was in this manner, <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> hitte the knight of the Sunne on the headpéece that he bowed his knées to the grounde. Then the knight of the Sunne gaue him an other that he staggered with it, the seconde time <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> hitte the knight of the Sunne a blowe vppon the headpéece, whereat the last time the knight of the Sunne stretching himselfe and following his blow, withal his mighte hit <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> so sure, that <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> fell vppon the ground mouing neither hand nor foote. The knight of the Sunne thinking it to bée but an amase stoode still while <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> might recouer agayne.</p><p>The whilest all the beholders much praysed the knight of the Sunne for the best knight lyuing, as well commending his courage as his actiuitye. The Duchesse <name rend="roman">Elisandra</name> likewise now hauing some hope by hir knight gate hir colour agayne, and hir ioye was as much as hir husbands sorrowe. But you haue not yet hearde the worst of the wicked Duke, for <name rend="roman">Aryden</name> reuiued: whom when the knight of the Sunne saw raysing himselfe vp he came hastely and holding the poynt of his sword agaynst <name rend="roman">Arydons</name> throate he spake saying. Thou shalt dye false <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> vnlesse thou confese the treason that thou hast deuised agaynst the Duchesse, and if thou doest dye in thys obstinate minde of concealyng so great outrage thou hazardest thy soules health. <name rend="roman">Arydon</name> as it wer halfe awake, and yet not so loth to die as stroken with a terrour of his owne conscience aunswered. Thy words haue abashed me more then the death which thou threatnest, the faulte which I haue committed hath bredde a greater horroure in my flesh: but make the Judges come néere and I will declare the whole.</p><p>The knights of the Sunne called the Judges, they comming néere hearde these wordes of his owne mouth, the substaunce of the Dukes shifting to wring his wiues enheritaunce to himselfe, in such manner as you haue

heard in <name rend="roman">Eliseas</name> report. The Judges strayghtwayes declared it to the king, who detesting theire fact, caused the Duke to be apprehended and both to be executed in that place</p><p>For albeit many of his nobles entreated for their pardon, yet the king so abhorred y^e villany that nought auailed: and at this time was the lawe first enacted in <name rend="roman">Hungary</name> that the law of punnishment for whoredome should stretche aswell to the man as to the woman, and that equall penaltie should be assinged to lyke offendours, whereas before the men escaped the women onely were in danger. Nowe after this execution, the Duchesse <name rend="roman">Elisandra</name> was sette at large, and the Quéene <name rend="roman">Augusta</name> receyued hir with great honour into hir company. The knight of the Sunne was very desirous to leaue the Citie: but the king desired much to knowe him, and to haue hym abide for some time in his court. In the time of his abode the knight of the Sunne grew in more familyar aquaintaunce with the king, and was much lyked of him bycause he séemed to resemble the Princessse <name rend="roman">Briana</name>, but one day the king importuning the younge knight to knowe his kinred vsed such lyke wordes.</p><p>Sir knight wee thancke you heartely for the paynes that you haue taken in the Duchesse of <name rend="roman">Pannonias</name> behalfe and for the maintayning of hir honour, whereby if shée haue receiued commoditie of lyuing and auoyding shame: so haue I receiued some quietnesse in my realme by the open detecting of such malefactours, &amp; their punnishment wilbe occasion of feare in others: for this cause I haue willed you to stay héere, as thereto I pray you heartelye, but I pray you lette me knowe your name and wher you were borne, for I know not how to call you. The knight of the Sunne well nourtered in the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> court after his humble thanckes for his Maiesties most gratious proffer and the promise of acceptaunce being a thing in déede very conuenient for the certefiyng of the Emperour

began as followeth. For your maiesties fauour I shall most willyngly doe your highnesse seruice and for the Duchesse I am glad that the equity of hir cause surdered my attempt, and for my name or countrey, I can better tell you the story of my lyfe since I came to yeares then declare that. Yet am I called the Knight of the Sunne by my deuice, and my education hath bene in the <name rend="roman">Souldans</name> courte at <name rend="roman">Babilon</name>, thether I being brought by the kings sonne in lawe, the king of <name rend="roman">Persia</name> when I was but a child and as it hath bene tolde me, found in a lyttle boate <sic>vp-</sic> the Sea, for my lyfe hetherto it hath bene in armes, and that doe I meane to pursue. The king and those which were with him were greatly amased tha thee had come from so farre a countrey, and had bene founde vppon the Sea, and that he knewe no more of his estate, but they thought that yet he was of some noble birth. The king thancked him and in this order the knighte of the Sunne stayed with the king <name rend="roman">Tiberio</name> for certeine dayes where he gayned many friends and one onely enemy, by name <name rend="roman">Florinaldes</name> which could not forgette the shame receiued before his mistresse, although it had done him no scathe: for in the ende <name rend="roman">Albamira</name> preferred him before the Earle <name rend="roman">Orfeo</name>. So as I say yet <name rend="roman">Florinaldes</name> seing the honour of the knight of the Sunne dayly to encrease to the discredite of the borne <name rend="roman">Hungarian</name>, his stomacke rose agaynst him, and one day he sette vppon the knight of the Sunne at vnawares, but to his owne losse, had not the knight of the Sunne bene more merciful, after they were made friends.

The matter is mine olde sute y^t you wot off, my desire is that at least I may be assured of hir good will. Sure I am if I moue the king in it that I shall obtayne. The Princesse <name rend="roman">Rodasylia</name> moued in déede w^t hir brothers afflictiō promised y^e uttermost of hir paynes, and within a while after she had some talke with the Princesse about that matter, hir wordes tending to lyke effect.</p><p>Madame you knowe right well the great loue which since I came to this courte I haue borne vnto you, and how I haue done you seruice in al that I was able, that which more is, in what manner I haue absented my selfe from my parents onely to be in your company, which if you know and confesse to be true, you must lykewise beléeue that that which I shall say now, rather procéedeth of good zeale towards your honoure, then of any purpose to worke mine owne contentment, though I cannot deny but that if I obtaine it will content me highly. But I doe not desire the thing which standeth not with your honour, and for my paynes reward seeke I none, but that I may be heard.</p><p>If I erre in ought wherin I shall counsaile you, then may you blame me, and yet I doubte not but when you shall haue throughly examined the whole, you shall rather impute the faulte to lacke of skill, then to any lacke of good meaning, and as I am certeyne that you haue this same opinion of mee without any farther suspecte,

so will I tell you my minde flatly. You knowe that you are the onely enheritrix of this kingedome, that your father the king my Lord must néedes marry you with such a one as may equall your estate, both for the naturall care which he hath ouer you in respect that you are his daughter, and for the profit which shall thereby redounde to his subiects, which cannot be well gouerned, the seate wanting a rightfull heire: you are withall at this time marriageable, my sute therefore is that héerein you will haue a more regard of the Prince <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> my brother a worthy knight of personage and valour, of an high birth, a kings sonne and heir, besides louing you so entirely as he can nothing more, long hath he endured this torment and neuer would bewray it to any but to me, and I haue hetherto suppressed it not to molest you now for compassion towardes him whome I must loue and honoure myne owne brother I require this that at least you shew him some good countenaunce whereby he may be encouraged to demaunde you of the kynge your father, which suite shall not be impossible if onely your lyking maye be wonne.</p><p>The Princesse angry at the heart with this speach for it was the thing most contrary to hir wish replyed shortly. Madame <name rend="roman">Rodasylua</name>, if I had thought that the zeale and loue which you haue professed and I doe confesse had tended to this issue, I shoulde lesse haue lyked your company, and I cannot thinke wel of it, that either you should breake with me of such matters or shoulde haue communication thereabouts with your brother, who as you say lacketh boldenesse to discouer his affection, which cannot be, doth he loue so earnestly, when he vouchsafeth not to speke vnto me but by a messenger. I suspect your words perhappes if I had hearde the man speake I miggt haue iudged in his countenaunce whether hee had lyed yea, or no.</p><p>But for truth you knowe I am of young yeares at

this instant, neither haue I will to marraige, I pray you therefore name it no more vnto mée, and yet when I am of yeares I may not choose my husband, and I am at the kinges commaundement whom I must obey. The princesse <name rend="roman">Rodasylua</name> so sharply rebuked by the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name>, and thereby gathering the little good wyll shee bare vnto hir brother, demaunded pardon of hir speache, and retourned to hir lodging whether she sent for the Prince <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name>, and to him she tolde the whole talke with the Princesse aunswere, willing him notwithstandinge not to gyue ouer but to make a better shewe as if hir aunswere mislyked hym not, and couertly to laboure the king for his consent.</p><p>This can hee not denye you, and after you maye winne the Princesse, for as yet hir excuse is but of yeares. The Prince liking hir counsayle departed from the Princesse his sister, and the next daye findinge the king at leysure he requyred his maiestie of a secret matter. The king commaunded those in presence to auoyd, &amp; tooke him to a windowe, where the Prince after his duetie done, began on this sort. Wyth your graces fauour I tust, I haue this longe time bene a welwiller to your daughter the Princesse <name rend="roman">Oliuia</name> and to haue hir to wyfe, whereto if it might please your highnesse to condiscend, I know my parents would wel agrée therto, for y^e great loue which they beare to your maiestie &amp; to me their sonne, &amp; thereby should I take my selfe to be the best rewarded for my long tarrying that euer prince was: I humbly beséech your highnesse to let me know your minde héerein. This demaund of the prince was nothing straunge to the king <name rend="roman">Oliuerio</name> for he suspected this matter long before, &amp; therfore his answere was short, that he was content to accept him for sonne in lawe, aswell for his owne worthinesse as for his birth, and for the friendship betwixt their people, yet sayth he, you shall giue me leaue to thinck thereon, &amp; you shall haue a more resolute answere: the prince hoping y^t his
<pb n="354" ed="digital"/><milestone n="[178L]     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
desire would take effect. Nowe the king to knowe the princesse minde therin went himselfe to the princesse lodging, where finding hir alone, hee counsailed hir in this sorte. It hath pleased God that the Prince <name rend="roman">Edwarde</name> thy brother should be lost in the realme of <name rend="roman">Hungary</name>, I hauing none other child but thee thinck it conuenient both for mine owne liking, and the common profit of my subiectes to haue thee marryed with some Prince of lyke estate. This haue I thought on a long time, and now vppon mature deliberation had wyth some speciall of my counsaile, I haue founde one: a prince which both for his power may, &amp; for his courage will, &amp; for his nobilitie is worthy to beare sway in so great an estate as this is, him am I content to take for sonne in lawe, and to commend my title vnto you. This Prince is <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> Prince of <name rend="roman">Lusitania</name>, whom you knowe right well, a comly knight of personage, valiant in armes, of a couragious spirite aboue all vertuous, and in his dealinges circumspect, courteous of speach and of highe estate, as I know fewe like. Ther are besides to commend this match the entercourse of trafficke betwéene our subiectes, and the friendshippe betwéene his parents &amp; mée. Héerein therefore say your owne fancy, for so farre as reason wyll, I am content to heare you: Thus sayd the kinge. But the Princesse whom these woordes more galled then swoord or speare, not knownig how to shift off the king hir father and not to aunswere his demaund, stoode in amaze for feare. The king séeing hir so silent, asked the cause why? she aunswered nothing yet a while. In the ende forced to say somewhat, she rather excused hir silence then <sic>reresolued</sic> the doubt. My Lorde and father sayth shée, I haue not aunswered you hetherto bicause I knowe not how to doe, neither may you now looke for a full answere. The matter is so straunge vnto mée, as that I neuer thought of it before, and your highnesse knoweth that I am of young yeares, &amp; as yet I haue no desire to marry,
<pb n="355" ed="digital"/><milestone n="178     The Mirrour of Knighthood." ed="1579" unit="page"/>
the time groweth on when I shall be of more age, and then perhaps shall I haue more desire, which whensoeuer it falles out shall be of your choise more then of mine owne. The kinge thinckinge that she had spoke as shéee ment, and that hir young age had bene hir onely staye, tooke in good part this excuse, willing hir notwithstanding to remember what he had sayd. So the kinge departed and the Princesse remayned somewhat better apayed by the kinges liking of hir aunswere, but hir hope was that <name rend="roman">Rosicleer</name> would come, and that he beeinge present the kinges minde might be altered as touching <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name>, and for this cause she made many a secret vowe for his spéedy retourne, but aboue all she looked for <name rend="roman">Fidelia</name>. The king at his retourne caused <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> to be called, to whome hée declared his talke with his daughter, and hir aunswere, adding moreouer that heereafter hée thought the matter possible inough, for hir good likinge, beside his, whereoff he might be assured. <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> was the gladdest man aliue, and thancking the king, for so high fauour, for that time he departed from the king, but the Princesse grewe to be more melancholyke then before, for she espyed what courage he had taken by the comfort which the king had gyuen him. After <name rend="roman">Don Siluerio</name> thincking the matter sure enough, departed the Realme with his sister <name rend="roman">Rodasilua</name>, where let vs leaue him and tourne to the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name>.</p></div><div id="mirrour058" type="chapter"><head rend="roman">¶ The Emperour Trebatio carried away the princesse Briana from the monastery of the ryuer.

ther of them thought themselues happy when they wer in the others company. This loue betwéene them was in other manner then that which aryseth by a blaste of beautie: and it endured so longe betwéene them, that neither yeares, nor sickenesse, nor death scarcely could once empayre it, and for thys loues sake could the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> willingly haue forborne both kiffe and kinred, and acquaintaunce in his owne countrey, and for hys loue durst the Princesse aduenture to flye hir Fathers Realme, and to abandon hir selfe to vnknowne passages, and to trauayle with <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> into <name rend="roman">Greece</name>. As the Emperour <name rend="roman">Trebatio</name> finding oportunitie tolde hir that he had counsayled with the knight of the Sunne as touchinge their departure, by whom he vnderstood y^t both for themselues and for the king <name rend="roman">Tiberio</name> it was méetest to depart, otherwise saith he, may y^e king your father be blamed for the death of the Prince <name rend="roman">Edward</name>, and our ioye might finde ende if I were discouered, but for the dispatche of thys whole matter, he sayd that he would leaue a letter in hir chamber wherein should be shewed both what and in what manner all thinges had bene done which you haue heard off. The Princesse yelded thereto gladly, and betwéene themselues they prouided thinges necessary for their departure, none being priuie thereto but <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> and the other gentlewomen. The day before the Princesse should depart, she tolde hir gentlewomen that shée had vowed ix. dayes fast in hir lodging, charging that for that time none should trouble hir, saue that she woulde haue <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> as she was wont, and this gentlewoman for necessary occasion. The Princesse was thus wont to doe very often which made it probable. The next day when all were ready and had voyded the princesse lodginge, the Emperour threwe in his letter and <name rend="roman">Clandestria</name> shut the doore. So by the secrete posterne they all departed: This was a good while before daye, and they tooke such horse as had bene prouided by the
