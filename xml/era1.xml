Foremost among these consecrated spirits, and serenest singer of them all stands, and will ever stand, the name of Lucy Stone, and although many months have passed since she whispered this her last message to her followers, "Make the world better," and then rested from her labors, yet to the many tributes already paid must ours be added lest the circle be incomplete. The public life of Lucy Stone begun early as all ardent, consistent and persistent abolitionist, and only after the emancipation of a race was secured did she consecrate herself to the work of freeing her sex from the many legal disabilities under which they rested, serenely indifferent to their humiliating position until some conspicuous case of the miscarriage of justice awoke them to a realizing sense of the helplessness of an unrepresented class, and to a suspicion, that law and equity was not always interpreted to mean the same thing for that class. For her untiring efforts to smooth the rough paths for all women, and for the strength and dignity she lent to their own feeble efforts to make life easier, we would have all women everywhere remember the debt they owe her. To the dismay of her loving, trusting followers she was mustered out of this, into higher service before the full realization of her dream of the complete disenthrallment of woman was realized; yet she lived long enough to see the world moving steadily, if slowly, on to the perfection she demanded of it. Let her fragrant memory be kept alive as a quicking force for all women who feel the responsibility of the part they must play in the coming regeneration of the world.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_1308" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_01.03" type="ClubNews"><head rend="center">NEWS FROM THE CLUBS.</head><div xml:id="era1_01.03.01" type="ClubNews"><head rend="center">New York Letter.</head><p xml:id="era1_1309">Mrs. W.E.

Cook</docAuthor><p xml:id="era1_13014">The Washington Colored Woman's League was organized in '92. Its officers are Mrs. H.A. Cook, president, Mrs. J.B. Bruce, and S.I. Fleetwood, vice-presidents, Mrs. C.L. Gruinke, recording secretary, Mrs. A.J. Cooper, corresponding secretary, Mrs. F.D. Shaw, treasurer, and the Board of Managers, Mrs. J.P. Bailey and Mrs. C. Terrell, Misses M.J. Patterson, M. L. Jordan, and C.L. Franklin.</p><p xml:id="era1_13015">This League has just issued its first annual report which cannot but prove interesting reading to ALL women. The club has reason to feel proud of its record and it is with pleasure that we make selections from the report by its President.</p><p xml:id="era1_13016">The object of the Woman's League as outlined in the Articles of Incorporation, is "the education and improvement of colored women and the promotion of their interests." It was conceived that this improvement must proceed on two general lines; the training of the mind and of the hand; the formation of classes for educational and for industrial work; and the first essential was a place in which this work might be carried on. It was therefore proposed that a stock company be formed with not less than a thousand shares at five dollars per share. Also, that each member of the League should be requested to take five shares of stock (amounting to twenty-five dollars) only one of which would be paid for each year.</p><p xml:id="era1_13017">This plan has been followed, with the result that 380 shares, equal in value to $1900 have been subscribed for. As only one-fifth of the whole amount is to be paid each year, only one fifth of the $1,900 will be immediately available. To this sum, however, must be added, $35, the price of 7 single shares of stock at $5 each, making $415.</p><p xml:id="era1_13018">But this house, the property of the League especially adapted to its purposes, is still a thing of the future. Until it becomes an actual and substantial possession, the educational and industrial work before referred to must be carried on by some other means. To this end classes, which meet in the parlors of the Y. M. C. A., have been formed in German grammar and reading, in German conversation, in English Literature, and in Hygiene. Though they have assembled only a few times, they have been well attended, the largest class numbering twenty-one. In each one there has been such evidence of interest, even enthusiasm, as to make the meetings a real pleasure to the committee which has the work in hand.</p><p xml:id="era1_13019">A series of three lectures, for the benefit of the girls of the High and Normal Schools and of the Eighth grade schools were offered by the Woman's League to the Trustees of the Public Schools and accepted. The first of the course, on Hygiene, by Dr. Julia R. Hall, and the second on Physical Culture, by Miss Mary P. Evans were delivered on the 12th and 26th of the present month. The third and last paper, on Dress, was read by Miss Elizabeth A. Cook on Friday, February 9th.</p><p xml:id="era1_13020">Another endeavor in the line of mental training is the promised payment of half the salary ($10 per month) of a lady who is to be employed as a Kindergartner by the University Park Association.</p><p xml:id="era1_13021">In the direction of Industrial Work I must first state that the League has two representatives in the Nurses' Training school, recently established in connection with the Medical Department of Howard University, that is to say, the League has paid the tuition fee of five dollars each. When the idea was first presented of including in our industrial efforts so admirable a feature as the instruction of trained nurses, the lectures at the Medical School had been in progress for some weeks and it was necessary for us to take our representatives from the classes already formed.</p><p xml:id="era1_13022">The Industrial Association formed in 1884, nearly all of whose members were also members of the League, decided in June, to continue their work as a committee of the Woman's League. They accordingly gave up their separate organization, turning into the treasury of the League, $50 in money, and furniture valued at $35, with the stipulation that they might at any time give public entertainments or make any special effort to raise money for carrying on their special work.</p><p xml:id="era1_13023">They are now engaged in a sewing school consisting of 88 pupils and 10 teachers. The directress is it lady whose knowledge and experience enable her to pursue the best methods of instruction. The Industrial Committee have also established in connection with the Sewing School a Mending Bureau by which they hope to accomplish several objects--to train the older girls in all kinds of repairing and mending, to keep up their interest by paying them a small sum for their work and to so manage the enterprise that after all expenses are paid, there will still be something left to provide material for the use of the school.</p><p xml:id="era1_13024">To conclude, the Woman's League now has in progress:</p><p xml:id="era1_13025">The purchase of a house and lot toward which $1,935 have been subscribed;</p><p xml:id="era1_13026">A course of lectures delivered at the High School and at Howard University;</p><p xml:id="era1_13027">Classes in German, English Literature and Hygiene;</p><p xml:id="era1_13028">The instruction of two students in the Nurses Training School;</p><p xml:id="era1_13029">A Sewing School and Mending Bureau;</p><p xml:id="era1_13030">The payment of half the salary of a Kindergartner.</p><p xml:id="era1_13031">May January 1895 find at far higher degree of advancement on all these lines and new avenues of usefulness opening in other directions.</p><signed>HELEN A.

The constitution adopted was that drawn up by the Washington Association, although a few by-laws were added to meet the special needs of our case, as from the first we intended to make our work largely industrial in character, since in a young and rapidly growing city like our own constantly receiving an influx of various nationalities it is exceedingly necessary that the industrial avenues shall be open to our young people.</p><p xml:id="era1_13034">The next step, in order to inspire confidence, gain permanence and be ready for the transaction of business was to become incorporated under the laws of Missouri. This was accomplished through the legal efforts of our friend, Lawyer Sublette. Committees were appointed for various departments of the work. About the first of April one room was rented and classes in fine needle work and in the English
<pb xml:id="era1_13033" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
branches were formed, the latter class consisted of old ladies over fifty years of age, yet in spite of their years and other difficulties they learned to write their names to read etc., by spending a portion of each Saturday afternoon with their teachers.</p><p xml:id="era1_13035">By the first of May the league was financially able to move into larger quarters, four rooms were rented in a very pleasant, respectable quarter and tastily furnished through the co-operation of the league and the Attucks Club, the latter composed of gentlemen who represent the moral and intellectual bone and sinew of our city.</p><p xml:id="era1_13036">During the month of May a dress-making department was added to the regular work of the league and it has been in operation ever since. We hope to add millinery, hairdressing and other industries as soon as practical. For the dressmaking department we purchased two sewing machines; aside from regular dressmaking we buy from the wholesale stores bails of gingham, white goods etc., to be made up into aprons, dresses, skirts waists, etc., by members, and these articles are sold at regular prices. By buying a little better grade of material than is usually given in the stores we create a demand for goods. During the summer months the ladies made the rent money, payments upon the machines, and other expenses in this manner and by selling ice cream and cake at the rooms.</p><p xml:id="era1_13037">At stated times during the winter months coffee, sandwiches and oysters will be sold and at intervals entertainments will be given. We desire as soon as possible to buy a piece of property and conduct a regular industrial school, ladies exchange, and other matters we have in mind. It will require at least five hundred dollars cash to make even a beginning of purchasing and when we found that it would require some time to raise this amount among ourselves and that meanwhile we would in practise be as far from saving our girls as ever, we determined to make a beginning in rented property and if possible by results impress the public with the idea that such an association as ours was a necessity to the city.</p><p xml:id="era1_13038">We are especially anxious to better the condition of women and girls, yet the first charitable work done by the league, and at its second meeting, was to collect money from the members to assist in sending an invalid boy to his home in the South.</p><p xml:id="era1_13039">A colored woman was sentenced to be hung in Kansas City in June '93; having made a very thorough investigation of the entire case we were fully persuaded that Justice to the woman and above all to the womanhood of our race demanded that the sentence should at least be commuted to life imprisonment. We drew up and circulated a petition to this effect which was signed by a large number of the most prominent men and women of both races; from these parties nearly one hundred dollars was collected to defray the expense attending such an effort. The petition was taken to the Governor of the state by a worthy representative from the U. T. C. N. and the president of our league with the result that the <choice><sic>sentenct</sic><corr>sentence</corr></choice> was commuted to a term of fifty years, although the death had already been set over the unfortunate woman.</p><p xml:id="era1_13040">Several girls who have found themselves friendless and alone in our city have been provided for in our rooms until they could obtain employment. An orphan thought the agency of our society sent to a good home out of the city.</p><p xml:id="era1_13041">Notice was brought to us of a blind woman whose little girls were in need of clothing. They were fitted out with gingham dresses and we intend to see that they are properly clothed for school during the winter and as much longer as is necessary.</p><p xml:id="era1_13042">These are a few of the things accomplished thus far. We are very far from the results we wish so earnestly to bring ,about but we hope that to some extent we occupy a niche in the community. In addition to the regular meetings we have a Junior Society composed of young girls from fourteen years on through the average school age. This forms an auxiliary to the regular league and meets monthly. A mother's meeting also forms a part of the work, at which time, practical talks upon the rearing of children, housekeeping, homemaking etc., form the basis.</p><signed>J.

Lee</docAuthor><head rend="center">WOMEN'S LOYAL UNION.</head><p xml:id="era1_13043">After the organization of the Women's Loyal Union, the idea of forming clubs among women began to grow in the minds of the women in other sections. Not least among them were the Women of New Bedford. Mrs. J. T. Fairfax and Mrs. Martha Webb were among those most zealous that Miss Wells should be heard in our city. They secured one hundred women to agree to labor earnestly and give Miss Wells an opportunity to lay her wrongs and those of our race before the people here. Miss Wells lectured in this city on the sixth of February and for that night's work those one hundred women pledged themselves to make what was then the Wells Circle a permanent organization. About April the Wells Circle became an established club with a membership of about twenty. Matters pertaining to our race in any way were discussed at each monthly meeting. Finally it was thought best to engage in more active work, and in July the name was changed to the Woman's Loyal Union. It was at the July meeting that each member agreed to bring as many names as she could secure toward forming a committee of one hundred or more who would pledge themselves to trade with the dry goods dealer employing a colored girl. Three or four important stores were visited. The result seemed then rather encouraging. One proprietor refused to do anything whatsoever for a colored girl, the second would give no direct answer either way but said if he had a place for an inexperienced girl, he would employ a colored girl. The third promised, after three days consideration, to employ a colored girl as soon as a place was found. That was three months ago, and yet new faces appear behind the counters of these stores. Since that time (last November), the monthly meetings have been poorly-attended, and all interest seems to have become dormant, except in the minds of eight or ten women. It is sincerely hoped that something can be done soon to arouse our women to the need of their measuring arms with the women of other sister cities.</p><signed>

This excellent report was published by the Boston Reflector and we feel sure that it will prove interesting reading to sister clubs already formed and in embryo; remarks from so many notable club women will be read with interest, we have no doubt.</p><p xml:id="era1_13050">Since this meeting, the club has grown to a membership of one hundred and four and has greatly enlarged its field of work. The chief feature of the club is its division into committees. These committees are formed to include every member of the club and are as follows--Ways and Means--matters pertaining to race, Domestic Science, Civics Literature, Philanthropy, Temperance, Current Events, Moral Reform, Press and Corative.</p><p xml:id="era1_13051">Every other meeting of the club is in the hands of some one of these committees, which provide suitable subjects for discussion.</p><p xml:id="era1_13052">As will he seen, the work of the club generally is chiefly educational, though each committee carries on practical work along its own line, with or without the active co-operation of the club. The Ways and Means Committee with the assistance of the whole club has just raised a scholarship for Atlanta University and the Domestic Science Committee has under consideration the agitation of more industrial training in certain of the public schools. The Committee on Civics is also preparing for a large meeting for the discussion of the civilization of Africa.</p><p xml:id="era1_13053">Mrs. Josephine Ruffin presided, and in a few well chosen words introduced Mrs. LAURA ORMISTON CHANT of England.

Clubs make women read and think in order that they may not sit like idiots when some bright paper is being read.</p><p xml:id="era1_13054">A great deal of the advice given to women about their staying at home, she said, is wrong altogether, for if a woman stays at home too much she will forget how to manage that home. At the club she will get new ideas from other women of how to live and manage her home, and great help in training her children, and to gain experience in various domestic trials. Women's clubs are educators of mothers and women who have not homes.</p><p xml:id="era1_13055">Not all women are intended for mothers. Some of us have not the temperament for family life. 'Tis a parody on love to try to love those near you.</p><p xml:id="era1_13056">Clubs will make women think seriously of their future lives, and not make girls think their only alternative is to marry. Clubs are great playgrounds for losing worry. A club teaches women to forget little cares and learn to discuss great things. Mutual admiration societies are better than scandal.</p><p xml:id="era1_13057">MRS. FLORIDA RIDLEY, secretary of the club, read the following report:
<lb/>
The idea of a Woman's Club, not necessarily a colored woman's club, but a club started and led by colored women had been dormant in the minds of a few women of Boston for some time. Of women's clubs there seem to be no end, and the field for women's work in this direction so completely covered as to leave little room for a new struggler. And yet with so many organizations, many of which were willing and anxious to receive colored women as members, there seem to be reason and indeed an earnest call for an organization of colored women. There are so many questions which in their application to the race, demand special treatment, so many questions which, as colored women, we are called upon to answer, more than this, there was so much danger that numbers of women would be over-looked unless some special appeal was made to them, that in February last, at the time Miss Wells was creating so much interest in her crusade against lynch-law, it was it a good time to carry out the club's idea, call the women together and organize, not for race-work alone, but for work along all the lines that make for women's progress. The result was that a club was formed with a membership of twenty, which has been more than doubled since that-time.</p><p xml:id="era1_13058">The actual work done by the club since its formation is small but most promising. Much of the time has been spent in getting into working order and in arousing interest. One practical effort, put forth by the club, however, has met with unexpected success. At the time of the Denmark lynching, it was thought and decided that we as colored women could not afford to overlook an event of such significance, we concluded to record a protest which should demand a little more attention than the usual form of resolutions, the result was that the leaflets were printed and sent in every direction. The responses that they have brought forth have been unexpectedly numerous and encouraging. More than one person has acknowledged that these leaflets have aroused them to a consideration of the subject, and more than one person of influence has announced their intention of doing something towards awakening public sentiment. Large demands for the leaflets have, been made, two hundred being called for at one time and a postal note being received from St. Louis calling for as many as could be spared.</p><p xml:id="era1_13059">This reception of the leaflets has revealed to the club a line of work which has been little used and which the club can incorporate with its other work with advantage. This is the publication and circulation of matter that refers especially to the race, not alone, but also such matter as shall be for the advancement and encouragement of the race, and to quote from our constitution "to collect all facts obtainable, showing the moral, intellectual, industrial and social growth, and attainment of our-people."</p><p xml:id="era1_13060">To this end the club has under c<gap extent="7" reason="tape repair"/>tion the publication of the answer, <gap reason="tape repair"/>Ingalls on the Negro question by M<gap extent="7" reason="tape repair"/> Deitrict and the stand taken by <gap extent="7" reason="tape repair"/>College and Massachusetts legislature<gap extent="7" reason="tape repair"/> Lewis affair.

"Another line of work of the club is the discussion of current topics. It is not our desire to narrow ourselves to race work, however necessary it is that such work should be done and particularly by colored women. It cannot but be admitted that we, as a race, have too frequently limited ourselves to this field with the result of contracting our vision, enfeebling our <choice><sic>impluses</sic><corr>impulses</corr></choice> and weakening our powers. We the women of the WOMEN'S ERA CLUB enter the field to work hand in hand with women, generally for humanity and humanity's interests, not the Negro alone but the Chinese, the Hawaiian. the Russian Jew, the oppressed everywhere as subjects for our consideration, not the needs of the colored women, but woman everywhere are our interest.</p><p xml:id="era1_13061">The club now numbers forty-five, it is hoped to make it three times as large and to that end we invite all eligible women, black or white who are in sympathy with our cause to unite with us.</p><p xml:id="era1_13062">MRS. LUCY STONE BLACKWELL spoke of the afternoon devoted to colored people, by one of the congresses at the Chicago Fair. At the congress she saw Mrs. Harper of Philadelphia, and another colored lady.

Fred Douglass was there, and was asked to address the meeting.</p><p xml:id="era1_13064">Mrs. Blackwell pathetically described how the venerable gentleman was <choice><sic>chocked</sic><corr>choked</corr></choice> with emotion to

see that he lived to witness the day when one of his sisters could address such an august body. Mrs. Blackwell cursorily viewed the life of Hon. Fred Douglass, and said that he was a pattern.</p><p xml:id="era1_13065">MRS. EDNA D CHENEY, next spoke. She said she would speak especially to the ladies of the Women's Era Club.</p><p xml:id="era1_13066">The New England Club asked her to bring their congratulations to the members of the Women's Era Club. Mrs. Cheney thought before coming, that it would be well to bring a few ideas as to the lines which the club should follow, but having heard the report from the secretary of the Women's Era Club she thought that they could teach her in the art of managing clubs.</p><p xml:id="era1_13067">Mrs. Cheney also complimented the new club on the broad stand which it takes, stating, that it was the way to secure union. She referred to the elm tree, how it grew until its branches finally formed an arch, a great touch of the Cathedral. Mrs. Cheney was especially pleased to find that the club set no barrier. We are to have a great composite civilization in America.</p><p xml:id="era1_13068">At the formation of many new clubs which Mrs. Cheney attended she was asked whether it would be right to leave politics and religion out. She replied emphatically no. It is there they are to learn and discuss such questions broadly, and they ought to find no better subjects to help them. It is such thought that is absolutely necessary, and puts one in nigh estimation, and enables one to cope with the questions of the day. Charles Sumner was able to do what he did by long training.</p><p xml:id="era1_13069">MRS. ABBY MORTON DIAZ ex-president of the Woman's Industrial and Educational Union, was the next lady who addressed the meeting. Mrs. Diaz spoke on the philosophy of life. She said there is no subject of more importance to the human being than the subject of humanity. The highest question of human beings is the object of humanity. It is customary with calculators to determine life by the amount of work done for the <choice><sic>sustainance</sic><corr>sustenance</corr></choice> of the body. But this was only animal. To enjoy thought in its highest <choice><sic>anges</sic><corr>ranges?</corr></choice>, music, art or any such <choice><sic>hing</sic><corr>thing</corr></choice> is the highest of life. Mrs. Diaz holds that men's clubs should be on such basis; thought is the ideal.</p><p xml:id="era1_13070">Go to these gatherings, and one will be able to get practical knowledge. She showed that in everything the feminine and masculine made the whole sphere. One without the other was incomplete. So to make the whole element was to join the two. Then people coming together is religion. The more we do this, the more religious we are. This is why Mrs. Diaz is in favor of this new club. Thought is the great leveller. When we get on the plain of intelligence, we are better together.</p><p xml:id="era1_13071">MRS. A. H. SPAULDING, who was the next speaker was thoroughly in sympathy with the WOMEN'S ERA CLUB. Many years ago it was with great difficulty that she could join a club. The influence that was exercised over men in their clubs was anything but what it should be; and drawing conclusions of clubs from these, she objected to them. But Mrs. Spaulding found out that women's clubs took a different line. The WOMAN'S ERA CLUB is a happy arrangement, and what they need is the consideration of great questions together. Women must learn to think independently.</p><p xml:id="era1_13072">Mrs. Spaulding said that she was glad to welcome the club into Boston club-life; glad to hear from the secretary's report such a broad and generous platform of principles. She said that she was thoroughly indignant at the injustice done a people whose only revenge was efforts to a higher education and a better equipment for the duties and responsibilities of a higher American citizenship.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_01.03.09" type="Club_News"><head rend="center">The Primrose Club.</head><p xml:id="era1_13073">The Primrose Club consists of young women associated together under the auspices of St. Augustine's Church, Phillips street, Boston, for mutual improvement.

The as it is oftener called, domestic science, is thus the very key-stone of the political arch. A civilized home may be fitly compared to a greenhouse in which are to be grown the choicest products of the people and over whose management the mother<gap extent="24" reason="tape repair"/> chief g<gap extent="24" reason="tape repair"/>ducts<gap extent="24" reason="tape repair"/>be ignorant, indifferent, or incompetent in the performance of her duties. So broad is the knowledge, so varied the skill, so incessant the performances demanded of her by her office that any woman might well tremble before her responsibilities. She must not only know how to keep her own health but how to foster and preserve the health of others, and this means that she must understand what is most wholesome to eat and drink and how food and beverage may be made most appetizing. Health for the whole household also demands that the housekeeper shall know the evil effects of dust-catching carpets, draperies, and stuffed furniture in small, crowded city apartments, as the comfort of the whole household likewise depends on her not filling the dwelling with more than can be easily cared for and kept in exquisite cleanliness. She must understand what constitutes the best bedding from the standpoint of durability, comfort and healthfulness, for as a third of every human life is spent in sleep, the sleeping-place is a matter deserving profound consideration. She must understand something of plumbing, of drainage, of heating, lighting and ventilation, for the germs of fevers and diphtheria lurk in bad plumbing and bad drainage, catarrhs and consumption are born of over-heated ill-lighted, and unventilated houses and all bodily and mental weaknesses may be traced to ignorance of the science of sound living. But not yet have we come to the end of the list of the good housewife's requirements. She must comprehend not only what food should be eaten in order to have the best nourishment at the least expense, but how to buy it, and how to cook it, for she may impoverish her family by ignorant purchasing, and even should she not have to cook it herself, she can never be sure of having food well-cooked unless she herself understands what good cooking is according to scientific principles. And she must also know everything possible to know about kitchen fuel, unless<gap extent="14" reason="tape repair"/>the family earning<gap extent="104" reason="tape repair"/>in buying every article that comes into the household, that by her wise investments she shall save time that would otherwise be wasted in constant shopping, save time in making garments of durable, instead of flimsy, perishable material, and save money in buying what is really good and lasting of its kind instead of what only makes a good show for a brief season. But though the housewife starts out on her career equipped with all knowledge as to fuel, food, drink, furnishings, clothing, drainage, plumbing, heating, lighting, and ventilation, not even yet has she learned the full course requisite for wise home-making. All this is but a preparation of the soil for the plants that are to be grown in one of the nation's private gardens. The wisdom needed to tend the plants themselves--the little children, who arc to be reared not only in health, knowledge, and industry, but in happiness (for happiness in a home is as essential as any other good feature), what preparation can too well fit a mother for this branch of domestic science? The mother thoroughly trained in domestic science will have learned all that the experience of other parents has collected and recorded in those cyclopaedias of childhood known as Babyhood, the Mothers' Nursery Guide, and so on, edited by wise teachers and physicians, she will have carefully studied the principles of kindergarten culture. She will steer safely between the dangers of over-indulgence on the one hand and over-severity on the other, and until each little human plant has gained a firm start in life, a wise domestic scientist will make its welfare her highest consideration.</p><p xml:id="era1_13084">Now it must be apparent to a reflecting person that she is a rare woman, and rarely situated in life, who can even faithfully superintend, much less herself perform, as they should be performed, all that I have here sketched as the duties of a wife, mother and housekeeper in our modern civilization.</p><p xml:id="era1_13085">In our modern <gap extent="100" reason="tape repair"/> Does the <gap extent="8" reason="tape repair"/> with an independent inc<gap extent="8" reason="tape repair"/> few or no children, and <gap extent="9" reason="tape repair"/> or many servants, live, d<gap extent="9" reason="tape repair"/> and have her being thus<gap extent="7" reason="tape repair"/> without considering all the cost of imitation at once the woman with no fixed income, with many children and with no servants, strives to rival the other's expenditure. O! the folly of the things bought, not because they are at all needed, or really for themselves wanted, but bought simply because Mrs. so-and-so has them. O! the misery of debts contracted, of money wasted simply and solely for the sake of doing what other people do.</p><p xml:id="era1_13087">The first result of a true training in domestic science is the gaining of courage to be one's own self, to live one's own life, to model one's own home in blissful independence of the rule of that social tyrant, Mrs. Grundy, the courage to have one's floors bare and serviceably painted, if one cannot afford a carpet in the first place, or the still greater expense of having a carpet properly and frequently renovated thereafter. The courage to have sleeping-rooms and kitchen well and comfortably furnished and equipped, even if the parlor has to wait long for any furniture whatever. Here the domestic scientist is strong. Honest comfort and health she will have first, luxury, if it come at all must wait her perfect convenience. The domestic scientist will begin her career by determining to sometime own her own home: for this she will plan, manage, and save, here a little, and there a little until her dream becomes a reality. National solmity demands ownership of <choice><sic>indivi-</sic><corr>individ-</corr></choice><pb xml:id="era1_13086" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ual homes. Life under another man's roof is unstable, whether it be in a West End tenement or in a gaudy apartment on the Back Bay. There is no greater joy in material possession than the joy of the home built as a result of one's own saving and planning.</p><p xml:id="era1_13088">But while so large a part of the population have to live close together in apartments, high and low, a great field lies before the domestic <gap reason="tape repair"/>avor <gap extent="30" reason="tape repair"/> this <gap extent="30" reason="tape repair"/> good I believe to be some form of cooperation, by which a dozen housewives living under the same roof may be spared the necessity of carrying on, separately, the same branch of labor. It may not be practicable to have one stove do the work which it could do just as well as the dozen separate stoves, to have one cook with one or two; assistants, do the work which she could do just as well as twelve separate cooks; for there would be great difficulty in suiting the tastes of twelve families and in serving the food hot in twelve separate dining-rooms, and without a separate dining-room for each family the best feature of home-life is gone. But I do not see why it is not perfectly practicable among any group of friends in a neighborhood to have the laundry-work in co-operation. There are many ways in which this might be done, but when it is remembered that one fire will heat as many irons as three separate fires, that two women working together can do nearly three times the work of one woman working separately, everyone must see the actual saving in expense, to say nothing of comfort, in even the simplest method of consolidation. Men long ago learned that better work was done by division of labor. This lesson housewives will be forced to learn if they do not want to sink beneath a mountain of toil and trouble and become mere stolid, patient drudges. It is a law of nature that there is a corresponding loss for every gain, and the gain in mental culture to the inhabitants of cities has been attended by a loss in physical strength. The complexity of city life, with its incessant drain upon the mental faculties and the sympathies, render it more and more impossible each year, for the average housewife to keep in touch even with her acquaintances, to say nothing of charities, clubs and church-work, and at the same time comfortably bear the burden of domestic life as her ancestors bore it under more primitive conditions. Wisdom dictates that women, as well as men, should make machinery do such hard drudgery as that of the laundry. The woman's club that would seize this idea and put it into practical operation would, indeed, open a new Woman's Era. As we look around us at the waste, discomfort, even misery, arising from the ignorance which prevails over the great mass of so-called homes, it is hard to think of waiting patiently, as we must wait, while the slow, <choice><sic>leven</sic><corr>leaven</corr></choice> of growing knowledge raises this mass to better living.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_01.05" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">Editorial Notes.</head><docAuthor>Ellen Battelle Deitrick</docAuthor><byline>ELLEN BATTELLE DEITRICK.</byline><p xml:id="era1_13089">The account of the first public meeting of the Woman's Era Club is lengthy, but will repay reading.</p><p xml:id="era1_13090">It is pleasant to record a number of subscriptions on the strength of the prospectus alone.

The night of the meeting was an intensely hot one and Mrs. Stone's strength was then on the wane but she cheerfully left her home on the breezy heights of Pope's Hill, and came down into the hot, dusty city, to give almost her last, as were her first public services given, in the interests of the colored people.</p><p xml:id="era1_13092">The article on Domestic Science which appears in this number of the WOMAN'S ERA was read before the Woman's Era Club in January and led to an interesting discussion. Mrs. Dietrick is a prolific writer and an authority on the subject of household economics. It is not too much to say that the great interest in household matters which is shown by the women of to-day, was aroused by the Women's clubs which were the first to consider the subject scientifically.</p><p xml:id="era1_13093">The next number of the WOMAN'S ERA will contain an article on the N. E. Women's Hospital by Mrs. Eduah D. Cheney. Colored women have always been in evidence at this hospital, either as nurses or internes, and it is to the keen foresight and generous cosmopolitanism of Mrs. Cheney, who as one of the founders of the hospital insisted upon no race lines, that we owe the opening up of this trained industry to the <choice><sic>coloaed</sic><corr>colored</corr></choice> young women.</p><p xml:id="era1_13094">Mrs. W. E. Matthews (Victoria Earle) the talented president of the Woman's Loyal Union of New York and Brooklyn, writes as follows: "I should be glad to have our Union represented in your forthcoming issue. I think with you that it (the paper,) is a positive necessity--for as the trend is toward organization among our women as among others, it will truly serve not only as a centralization of ideas, but will stimulate and encourage and revive the hopes of those now earnestly engrossed in the work of organization of women generally. I sincerely rejoice in any effort put forward for the advancement of our women. Such endorsement from such a source means much to us.</p><p xml:id="era1_13095">THE REFERENDUM.--much misunderstanding exists concerning the recent Supreme Court decision on the matter of the "referendum." Evidently it is thought by many that the decision deals a death blow to woman suffrage in this State. This is not so. The court was asked to rule on the constitutionality of three points, raised by the opponents of Woman suffrage in the Massachusetts legislature, and decided that all three forms of referendum were unconstitutional, and could not therefore be submitted to a popular vote. The matter stands now just where it did before, in the hands of the legislature, which has ample power to immediately pass a law giving full municipal suffrage to women.</p><p xml:id="era1_13096">It would take a paper twice the size of the WOMEN'S ERA to accommodate the matter that has come in for this issue. The publishers have been more than gratified by the hearty and ready response of our women, it is indeed gratifying to come into communion with so many fair-minded women. Should the paper receive proportionate financial encouragement the publishers will be only too ready and willing to enlarge it.</p><p xml:id="era1_13097" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era1_13098">A Congress of the colored women's leagues and clubs of the Country was suggested long ago should we not be moving in the matter now?

The need of such a journal has long been felt as a medium of intercourse and sympathy between the women of all races and conditions; especially true is this, of the educated and refined, among the colored women, members of which class may be found in every state from Maine to Florida, but in nearly all of these places an important factor, and one that receives little or no recognition, and the one more than all others which prevents her from making the most of herself and taking her <choice><sic>legitamate</sic><corr>legitimate</corr></choice> place among the advanced women, is the limitation of - her surroundings and the circumscribed sphere in which she must move. The impossibility of mingling freely with people of culture and learning, and so carrying on the mental growth begun in schools and colleges, shuts her in with her books but shuts her out of physical touch with the great world of art, science and letters which is open to all other ambitious women.

During the winter months many industries are always quiet and there are always many out of employment at such times, but the season that has passed has seen more than the usual number out of work for a longer time than usual; although appeals for aid have been generously met by the charitable, yet it takes more than money for such a crisis and just how such a crisis should be met or averted .)r prevented is and will be a subject for serious consideration.</p><p xml:id="era1_130109">Although the problem of the unemployed is occupying the minds of earnest thinkers, yet it like the "Negro problem" seems to many laymen no problem at all. They both seem to be cases when a "judicious letting alone" would prove the solution, and which, if left to natural laws, would adjust themselves. Only give the negro an equal chance and then leave him alone to improve it, and he will come out all right.

Good farms everywhere are still being deserted because the men who should be tilling the soil are crowding into trades and factories that are already overflowing, and young housekeepers are still losing health and spirit because girls who would find good homes and wages in domestic service prefer to crowd shops and factories.</p><p xml:id="era1_130111">But, some say, since this is the case what can be done about it, we can't make people do what they don't want to and we can't see them starve? No we can't, but we need not encourage people to do the things it would be best for them not to do, oftentimes many of the women who are urged to work in the interests of working-girls' homes and rests and clubs, etc., are women who themselves would gladly offer in their own homes a refuge for good girls and who are worn to death trying to do the work they are willing to pay to have done, and working in the interests of those who should not need to be worked for.</p><p xml:id="era1_130113">Labor problems, in a large measure must be left to adjust themselves "creating work" for

the unemployed can do no permanent good. Let the people understand the law of supply and demand be made to realize the hopelessness of any chance of prosperity in those trades which are already too full. Such education would be of much more value to them both morally and financially than any possible system of "aids."</p><p xml:id="era1_130114">There are cases of more than one factory girl out of work who when asked to go to service have replied that they "would starve before they became servants." There must be something wrong when such a situation is possible and if from the present distress men who should be working the earth and women who should be working in the house are led back to their proper field and are made to realize that the dignity of labor lies with the laborer entirely, the winter's suffering will not be in vain.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_01.07.03" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">DIFFICULTIES OF COLONIZATION.</head><p xml:id="era1_130115">None but fools seriously believe that the colored people of the United States can be colonized without their consent. Their deportation would bankrupt the government. It would require one steamer carrying a thousand souls to sail every day to deport the thousand negro babies born daily. It would simply be impossible to convert the property of the colored people, amounting in round numbers to three hundred million dollars earned by them and one seventh of all the property of the government amounting to many millions more into cash, for of course any scheme of colonization which could hope to get the consent of the civilized world would have to secure to the people removed from the country their property. What kind of a commission, composed of what kind of men can be appointed by the ingenuity of human beings wise enough to determine where Ham leaves off and Japhet begins? Who is to say what men are colored and what men are white? The colored people decline to be driven from their homes and their country. Will some sage point out the part of the constitution wherein is found the law authorizing a government to deport one seventh of the people, the citizens, the makers and owners of the government? There is some authority for apprehending and exporting or punishing the blatant demagogues political or clerical, native or alien who go about the country preaching such stuff which tends to stir up the people and lead to internal dissension and sooner or later to strife and bloodshed. It is a physical and legal impossibility to deport the colored people. It is not impossible to keep out of the country the rifraff of other countries who owe no allegiance to man or God, who are opposed to any government that compels them to work for a living and to observe and not encroach upon the rights of other men. The audacity of foreigners who flee their native land and seek refuge here, many of them criminals and traitors, who are here but a day before they join in the hue and cry against the native born citizens of this land is becoming intolerable. No government upon earth would permit it but the United States, and all the signs of the times point to a time not far off where self defence and self protection will force this government to protect its own people and to teach foreigners that this land is for Americans black or white and that other men are welcome and can come here only by behaving themselves and steering clear of plots and schemes against the people and the citizens who are here by right.</p></div></div><div xml:id="era1_01.08" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_130116"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we111.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 2.

This lack of knowledge among women i<gap extent="24" reason="tape repair"/> read the <gap extent="24" reason="tape repair"/>,/gap&gt; do not read <gap extent="19" reason="tape repair"/> The average woman is content to read the sensational news, the fashion and the society columns, and pass over the more solid matter as uninteresting. The daily papers give a synopsis of the history of the world for the past twenty-four hours, and, if read understandingly, presents situations as startling and dramatic as are enacted on the stage at any time. It is not only necessary to know what to read, but it is also necessary to know what not to read. It is <choice><sic>indicatative</sic><corr>indicative</corr></choice> of a certain want of refinement in the mind that selects the murders, scandals divorces and such matter, to the exclusion of the larger things of life. The great attraction of French women lies in the fact that they take interest in the things in which men are interested, and keep themselves thoroughly in touch with the affairs of <choice><sic>goveinment</sic><corr>government</corr></choice>.</p><p xml:id="era1_130135">There is one room in the Boston Public Library of which very few women seem to be aware, or perhaps, wrongly suppose that it is reserved for the exclusive use of men, <choice><corr/><sic>since it is resorted to almost en-</sic></choice>since it is resorted to almost entirely by the sterner sex. This is the Magazine Room at the right of the Lower Hall. Women share equally in the privileges of this room, and a table is reserved for the use of women only, by way of encouragement. It is hoped that more of our women will find how restfull it is to spend a half-hour in the Magazine Room after a shopping trip down town.</p><p xml:id="era1_130136">An event worthy of special attention is the publication, in one volume of the entire poetical works of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. This is the Cambridge Edition.

It treats of the time when slaves were owned extensively <choice><sic>thoughout</sic><corr>throughout</corr></choice> Massachusetts and Connecticut, and the period immediately following their emancipation.</p><p xml:id="era1_130138">Harper's also contains an article by Dr. T.

For instance, even if one has outgrown the stories of the Youth's Companion, one can never be too old to enjoy the historical sketches, or the articles on the aspects and customs of other countries.

The average housewife sees before her visions of <choice><sic>innnmerable</sic><corr>innumerable</corr></choice> things to be done before summer, and usually, even before <gap extent="6" reason="tape repair"/>ing the first contempl<gap extent="18" reason="tape repair"/>palling di<gap extent="120" reason="tape repair"/> best suited to <gap extent="10" reason="tape repair"/>pression, must, before results can be achieved, be dispelled, and some sympathizing friend recommends a bottle of somebody's "Sarsaparilla" as the most efficient means of eradicating the ills that "flesh is heir to."</p><p xml:id="era1_130147">Now, while the spring bitters of our grandmothers was undoubtedly productive of wonderful results in the way of physical renovation, the average patent medicine of to-day is from nature so far removed that only in extreme cases is benefit derived. Nature is, however, kind to us, and in taking her as she is we can test her powers. Few things are so beneficial to tired and nervous dispositions as a daily draught, one hour long, of pure air and sunshine; in other words, outdoor exercise is the spring necessity. Bright, balmy mornings are in themselves an invitation to enjoy them, and opening buds, birds and scenery furnish the needed diversion-the by-path where rests is found.</p><p xml:id="era1_130148">Spring is a rather more favorable thus for the formation of walking clubs than fall, and an hour in the early morning say from six to seven, the most favorable time. Of course when breakfast must be prepared and household duties performed some later hour must be chosen--but the remedy has been prescribed--and the only other directions are, "Take regularly each day."</p><p xml:id="era1_130149">Apropos of the early walk, a cheerful disposition is worth the cultivation. You have all heard of Dr. Joy's Golden Specific for "the blues"--the little couplet thoroughly digested--
<q><lg type="couplet"><l>Whenever you are feeling blue,</l><l>Something for some one else go do.</l></lg></q></p><p xml:id="era1_130150">"The blues," however, is now an obsolescent phrase, and, its cure hardly needs further comment.</p><p xml:id="era1_130151">In a recent journal I noticed after a somewhat lengthy exegesis on "Nervousness in Girls," a good doctor's suggestion for its banishment. He said the only necessity was for the child to feel that it was loved. There are few ailments productive of so great suffering and so little sympathy as unstrung nerves. Naturally a girl looks for sympathy from her mother, and it is astonishing to think how few mothers understand how to give real sympathy that can be felt. They give their time, health and means oftentimes, and while the child is blessed with external luxuries all her cares and petty grievances are kept <choice><sic>t</sic><corr>to</corr></choice> herself. There is but one thing necessary. Let the mothers remember that they once passed through the same experience, and that it means only a little self abnegation to put them<gap extent="17" reason="tape repair"/>thizing plane with their <gap extent="160" reason="tape repair"/>of repeated <gap extent="30" reason="tape repair"/> housemaker are still looking in this direction for the evolution of the problem of domestic service.</p><p xml:id="era1_130152">A scheme for cooperative laundry work has been talked about here and even if not carried out, the idea might serve for others. A lady who has a large and convenient laundry in her own home proposed to four or five friends that they send their laundry to her to be done by one laundress. This is a simple and practical scheme, one that can be carried out by any lady with a saving of time, fuel, money and annoyance.</p><p xml:id="era1_130153">The number of women (and women who dress well and beautifully, too) who want the matter of dress simplified, grows every year. Women live too largely and broadly in this time, to be bound down to every change of sleeve or skirt, besides this, sensible women will not long consent to give up at the command of unknown rulers, fashions which are sensible and comfortable. Dressing well, is becoming a terrible burden to women of small means. Amateur dressmaking will not do nowadays, fashions are changing continuously and dressmakers charges are growing slowly but certainly upward. Does the worry and strain which all but the very rich are forced to endure to "keep up" pay in the results? It is to be hoped however, that whatever the future brings us, it will let us keep blouse waists, loose outside garments and short skirts. These all have the true beauty, the beauty of appropriativeness.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_01.11" type="Article"><head rend="center">CHATS WITH GIRLS.</head><docAuthor>Leslie Wilmot</docAuthor><salute>

Mrs. Cooper sent Rev. Shaw a note explaining the situation and that lady came flying down to see her, expressing her righteous indignation, but that did not change the rules of the house. To a Chicagoan (?) the whole thing is such a ridiculous farce.

What business had it to blow so violently? It was but natural that Mr. Brougham having a cold should draw out that handkerchief, and how could Miss Myrtle's plants get air if she did not open the dining room window.</p><p xml:id="era1_130237">So at ten minutes past eight, Mr. Brougham, passing Miss Myrtle's cottage, drew out his hankerchief, as we have said before; of <choice><sic>cousre</sic><corr>course</corr></choice> he should have been more careful for that very morning, Mrs. Brougham had given him the handkerchief with his initials worked with her own hair, it being the anniversary of their wedding day. Though Mr. Brougham, who was never romantic and whom six years of married life had rendered less so would have preferred something more substantial, still he had thanked Mrs. Brougham and was now about to use, well, he was just taking the handkerchief from his left breast pocket, (to please Mrs. B, he had put it in his left breast pocket, although he had much rather put his cigar there because it would be handy, but as the pocket in question was right over his heart and as it was the anniversary of his wedding day, it became him to discommode himself a little, at least until he was out of sight). But we must go back to the wind. This mischievous, naughty wind seeing the handkerchief in Mr. Brougham's hand and Miss Myrtle's window open thought what fun it would be to snatch the article from its owner's hand and waft it into the window. Oh, what a mischievous wind it was! No sooner thought than done and a second later, Mr. Brougham stood looking thoughtfully in every direction while the handkerchief lay thoughtlessly on the dining room floor.</p><p xml:id="era1_130238">"Great Powers! what a wind," said Mr. Brougham I must confess that he used a much stronger term, but I am not versed in the orthography of it. Mr. <choice><sic>Brongham</sic><corr>Brougham</corr></choice> buttoned up his coat and continued his walk, and his nephew, who lived opposite and was observing him, nearly died of laughter as he afterwards said. Not contented with the mischief it had already wrought, the wind broke off a <choice><sic>beaut ul</sic><corr>beautiful</corr></choice> calla lily. Now when Miss Myrtle entered the room the first thing she saw was the lily. "O, my beautiful calla!" she exclaimed, "Could the cat have done it?" "Puss, puss," she called but no cat appeared. Then she spied the handkerchief. "It is not mine. I wonder where it came from," she murmured. And then she said, "Oh, the wind most likely." Tossing the handkerchief on the table, she closed the window.</p><p xml:id="era1_130239">At half past ten, precisely, Mrs. Grant stepped in to see Miss Myrtle. Now, Mrs. Grant had two faults--she loved to talk and she always saw the worst side of human nature. After telling Miss Myrtle that she could not take off her bonnet;  that she had only dropped in to borrow some knitting needles; that her plum preserves were probably boiling over on the stove at home; that Tom Crane had cut his hand; that Lena Smith was flirting dreadfully with the Baptist minister; that Samuel Cole's son had been robbing the Skimps' orchard and would surely be hung some day, and that if he were her boy she would manage him better, she rose to depart and as she neared the door saw the handkerchief. Now; Mrs. Grant had been at Mrs. Brougham's the <choice><sic>eveing</sic><corr>evening</corr></choice> before, admiring the same handkerchief and then Mrs. Brougham's hair had a peculiar color. When she was young, her admirers called it auburn, golden and other names, but her brothers (who tell the truth like relatives?) said that Maria had the queerest kind of red hair that they had ever seen.</p><p xml:id="era1_130240">At any rate, Mrs. Grant saw the hankerchief and recognized it at once. Hurrying home, she rescued her plum preserves from instant destruction and putting her dinner on, started for Mrs. Brougham's. She ran into the house all out of breath. "Why, what is the matter?" inquired Mrs. Brougham.</p><p xml:id="era1_130241">"Now, Maria Brougham, you and I have been friends so long that I think it would come better from me than a stranger," cried Mrs. Grant, which considering that they had always quarrelled when schoolgirls, and had been rivals in most things ever since, this friendship seemed remarkable.</p><p xml:id="era1_130242">That this speech foreshadowed some bad news to herself Mrs. Brougham, well knew.</p><p xml:id="era1_130243">"What is it?" she asked impatiently.</p><p xml:id="era1_130244">"I would say nothing about it but I think you really ought to know,</p><p xml:id="era1_130245">"Know what?" demanded Mrs. Brougham in a sharp tone.</p><p xml:id="era1_130246">"Well my dear, don't get angry. Every one has trials though I did think this would be spared you. Men will be men and even poor Grant in his lifetime--"</p><p xml:id="era1_130247">"Is it anything about Mr. Brougham ? " inquired his wife.</p><p xml:id="era1_130248">About him! Well, you see as I was saying that we can't expect men--"</p><p xml:id="era1_130249">"Sarah Grant, tell me what you have to say or hold your peace," screamed Mrs. Brougham.</p><p xml:id="era1_130250">You need not be so high and mighty about it," answered her tormentor. I saw that handkerchief you showed me last night in Miss Myrtle's house this morning, and they do say that he prefers Miss Myrtle to his own wife."</p><p xml:id="era1_130251">"Who says so?" <choice><sic>demended</sic><corr>demanded</corr></choice> Mrs. Brougham.</p><p xml:id="era1_130252">"Everybody, but I never believed it until now. "</p><p xml:id="era1_130253">"I don't believe it!" said Mrs. Brougham.</p><p xml:id="era1_130254">"Not believe it! You might as well tell me I am lying," screamed Mrs. Brougham.</p><p xml:id="era1_130255">"I mean, perhaps, you are mistaken," cried poor Mrs. Brougham, who felt no desire to quarrel at that moment.</p><p xml:id="era1_130256">"Mistaken!

Its object is the intellectual and social improvement of its members We represent the "queens of the fireside," as all of us are wives and almost all mothers. Naturally our attention was at first given to home training and domestic economy. Papers were read and discussed and useful and beneficial suggestions were adopted by us. This, together with "Current Topic Talks," comprised the first year's work. Each lady felt herself so much benefited that it was thought best to double our number, therefore, twelve more ladies were invited to associate with us and we formed an institute and successfully carried out a plan of study last year, in which we succeeded fairly well. The knowledge we gained made a generous impression upon us, and it was concluded that if we could help ourselves in short talks and a few hours' study each day, that much good could be accomplished if we founded an industrial school for our women and children. On the first Tuesday in January 1894 we adopted resolutions to the effect that we would use every effort this year to get means to purchase a lot and erect a cottage for the salvation of our girls. We are moving along nicely with twenty-four willing workers and twelve who are friendly to our cause. WE hope to have $500 by next January and a home. Already we have been encouraged by the results of the entertainments. We have just begun on industrial work this month. We instituted a lecture course and the presidents of the W. C. T.

Of the four afternoons and evenings during which it was held, there was only one evening when the weather was pleasant, for the rest although the beautiful little hall was elaborately decorated and the cafe stocked with "good things" to eat, the rain snow and sleet were the obstacles which prevented the public from enjoying these features in large numbers. </p><p xml:id="era1_130364">In spite of the storm, however, Children's Day found the hall well filled with happy youngsters and admiring parents. Those who braved the storm were amply repaid, for there are few prettier sights than that of children dancing.</p><p xml:id="era1_130365">Some of the features of the Carnival was the sale of home-made bread, pies and cakes, of household articles and implements, delicious home-made tonics, hot chocolate and the exquisite cups in which it was served. Besides these there were the usual features in tables for aprons, flowers, fancy goods and an especially attractive tissue paper table. No pains were spared to make the carnival a great success and had the weather been favorable the sum cleared above the great expense would have been much larger.</p><p xml:id="era1_130366">Other leagues may find in this rather detailed account some suggestions which may be used to their advantage.</p><p xml:id="era1_130367">The club meets bi-monthly, the first meeting each month being devoted to business, the next six meetings are arranged, the literature, the temperance, and the civics committee will each provide for a meeting with appropriate speakers.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_02.10" type="Article"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">SHALL WE HAVE A CONVENTION</seg> OF THE COLORED WOMEN'S CLUBS, LEAGUES AND SOCIETIES?</head><docAuthor>J.

I am of the opinion that great good would result from an interchange of ideas as to how we could best accomplish the more lasting results of the Work each league is engaged in. By understanding the object of each league's work, I believe we could so harmonize our efforts that it might be uniform throughout the country and much good result therefrom. To the second question I beg to reply in favor of Chicago as the place and the month of August as the time for holding the Congress. You will pardon me for naming Chicago, however, I am convinced there is not another place in the United States that affords its good facilities for the meeting as the great convention city of America. We have a Woman's Club here with a membership of more than 200 ladies all enthusiastic in all matters pertaining to the elevation of woman and the good of the race in general. The scope Of our work is unlimited, and it would afford us great pleasure to have the opportunity of greeting and entertaining the noble women of our race in the first grand congress of colored women.</p><p xml:id="era1_130384">I think the ladies would gain inspiration by breathing the free air, and mingling with the broadminded women of Chicago.

I favor it to such extent that I would urge it among our women. My experience in association work hardly entities me to offer a suggestion as to the time and place of such a convention. I really think with the Women's Era in its opinion.</p><p xml:id="era1_130389">Concerning the Washington League under Mrs. Cooper's splendid leadership, so far as I know at this time, the most general opinion is that Philadelphia is centrally located, thus convenient to all.</p><p xml:id="era1_130390">August, in any judgment, is for several reasons the best time for holding conventions. I favor a Congress, first because I believe it would arouse the interest, and center the attention of our women in common, which will lead to not only an interest generally, but a deeply rooted local pride in the matter of organization and this practical support of the same. The interchange of the views of thoughtful women as to the needs of the home will prove not only instructive, in itself, but will lead to, or should lead to the general adoption of a broad plan or method of action, Organization among our women is, practically speaking in the experimental stage, to the average woman--conservative, refined educated woman--the formation of associations for the avowed purpose of the advancement of race interest, is handicapped by a certain lack of precedence and unfortunately enveloped in uncertainty as to method--so much so that there is a marked disposition among them to consider the movement as one embracing many difficulties, and are inclined to stand off and see to what degree of success the originators of the club movement will attain, prudence is to be commended always, but it is wise to consider the adage.</p><p xml:id="era1_130391">"In the absence of the best, the worst will prevail" and as the various organizations are permanently organized, it <choice><sic>behoves</sic><corr>behooves</corr></choice> those to whom light is given to think for the future, and assist in the matter of establishing a high standard, in the very beginning, a Congress would ventilate for good all such views--therefore if I have any voice at all I raise it to hope that the WOMEN'S ERA will agitate the matter.

Unfortunately the beginnings of their club work are still so unimportant to any but themselves that, the great medium of intercourse, the newspapers, does not bring them to acquaintance with each other. Little bands here and there are trying each in its own way, to lift those that can reach to a higher plain. But as yet the colored women workers are missing the sympathy, the encouragement, the larger wisdom that comes from intercourse with others who are pushing on towards the same ideal. If the WOMEN'S, ERA Had expired the first issue would yet have set the ball rolling toward what seems to me the next effective move for progression, the fellowship of Colored Women's Clubs, and Boston as the place. I choose Boston for the reason that I know of no other city where the attitude of the press and that of the general public would be as respectful; nor where the impressiveness of such a gathering would receive such recognition.</p><p xml:id="era1_130396">May we have a congress with all its means of mental strengthening, to say nothing of the quickening influence of the hand-clasp, and a look into the faces of the women who are striving to realize the same ideals.</p><signed><name>MARIA L.

An experiment in domestic science started, apparently, under the most highly favorable conditions, in <choice><sic>Cambrige</sic><corr>Cambridge</corr></choice> some years ago, came to utter grief and failure from lack of <choice><sic>learing</sic><corr>learning</corr></choice> this first lesson. The ambitious experimenters started a co-operative store for groceries, a co-operative bakery, and a co-operative laundry, all at the same time, and with no previous experience of such undertaking among their members. Naturally, their enterprises were soon wrecked upon the rocks of their own utter inexperience. And yet there is no reason in the world why any one of the three, adventured alone, might not have gone on to brilliant perpetuation. You are, possibly, all familiar with the history of the 28 poor weavers in England, who, just fifty years ago, clubbed together to buy their own tea and sugar at a wholesale shop in order to get a better quality at a less price than they could obtain at retail groceries. Each one saved a little out of his weekly wages until they jointly accumulated <choice><sic>enought</sic><corr>enough</corr></choice> cash to buy one chest of tea and one hogshead of sugar. Then each one bought from this common stock, paying cash for it and giving the same price charged at the retail groceries. When they reckoned up account before re-investing they found they had made for themselves a handsome profit, in fact they had saved the profit they had formerly given to the corner grocer, and had also had a much better quality of tea and sugar. As the news spread, the enterprise grew; other laborers joined them; as their profits accumulated they began to buy other things in the same way, bread, wheat, and clothing then others, and still others, until to-day that society, called the Rochdale Pioneers, has become a vast concern carrying on a yearly business of much over a million dollars.</p><p xml:id="era1_130457">The full history of the working of this wonderful enterprise is well worth careful study, for it is one of the most encouraging recitals of what may be <choice><sic>accomplised</sic><corr>accomplished</corr></choice> from humble beginnings to be found in human experience. There are now, altogether, 1,120 of these co-operative societies in Great Britain, with over a million of members and whose joint-stock capital, or savings, together amounts to about 35,000,000 of dollars. Is not this indeed a tall oak to grow from such a little acorn as the saving of enough to buy a little tea and sugar? Now I see no reason why the women of Boston <choice><sic>shonld</sic><corr>should</corr></choice> not, in some such fashion, start and build up a cooperative laundry.</p><p xml:id="era1_130458">It is true that <choice><sic>co-operativ</sic><corr>co-operative</corr></choice> labor would be more difficult than co-operative buying, but bright minds have overcome greater obstacles than that.</p><p xml:id="era1_130460">But, meanwhile, the domestic science department of this club may find a much-needed work ready prepared for their hands; And that is to make an organized, persistent effort to have domestic science taught to girls from ten years of age and upward, in the schools of this locality. When we reflect what careful preparation is now deemed necessary in order to teach teachers how to teach, we would not wonder that so large a number of mothers who have domestic knowledge themselves but are not trained in the art of teaching, do not know how to successfully train their own daughters. And when we reflect upon how many mothers themselves do not even have a high grade of knowledge of any kind, we need not wonder that thousands of girls are now growing up in ignorance of this most vital science. Undoubtedly, what could be taught in the schools would be but an outline and a beginning, and foundation to build on in the future, but even this foundation of domestic science would be well worth all the time and trouble that might be spent in procuring its establishment, and it would be a great credit to the WOMAN'S ERA could this be <choice><sic>acheived</sic><corr>achieved</corr></choice> through their endeavor. If possible it would be well to have such scientific <choice><sic>traning</sic><corr>training</corr></choice> given equally to boys and to girls, for such teaching would have a moral result, as well as technical value, in teaching boys to properly estimate what they are now apt to scorn as inferior work merely because they deem it women's work. To the true scientist no work is inferior work though there may be reasons why persons of great capacity should leave certain kinds to be done by those of less varied capability, but there is no question that our life is richer if we have sometime each tried our own hand at every branch of human labor within reach of our experiment. The woman who has never herself actually performed any of the duties of the household is at as great a disadvantage as the <choice><sic>manuufacturer</sic><corr>manufacturer</corr></choice> who has never performed any part of the labor of a manufacturing business. As I have before stated, I believe in division of labor, and I think all household labor will be better, done when women evolve some plan by which cooking may be done by a highly skilled and scientific cook, laundering by an equally <choice><sic>accomplihsed</sic><corr>accomplished</corr></choice> laundress and general cleaning by another expert specially trained for this branch of work, just as in a manufacturing establishment, one was a fireman, another engineer, another book-keeper, and so on. But many of the richest manufacturers in the country are now requiring their sons to begin at the bottom of the business ladder, as humble workmen in their father's or some other person's factory, learning the work of every department by actually doing the work. Just so, I think young women should begin to learn domestic science by going through every operation from cleaning stoves and building fires, to the artistic arrangement of a parlor. I have myself gone through every step of such discipline, and for no amount of money would I part with the feeling of independence, that has come from possession of <choice><sic>thi</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> practical knowledge concerning every branch of labor that can be carried on in a household. It seems as if every person who can hold a brush ought to know how to scrub a pine table or floor. Imagine then my astonishment when the domestic scientist who was my instructor proved to me that the way I imagined it should be done was of all others the worst way. I wonder how many present have learned that an unpainted wooden
<pb xml:id="era1_130459" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
table can only be kept in its most beautiful state of whiteness when scrubbed with cold water? It was, at any rate, a revelation to me, who had supposed grease could only be extracted by the use of the hottest of hot water. In one of the classes which I attended was a mother of a family, over 40 years of age, who had never before learned the scientific mode of building a fire. She was as delighted as a child with a new toy when she finally knew how to go successfully through every step of this process, from cleaning the grate, to properly laying the kindling, and putting on coal so there could be no failure. One housekeeper in this class discovered that $2 worth of prepared kindling wood could be saved each month in the kitchen, simply by a scientific use of kindling, to say nothing of the saving of comfort and increase of pleasure which came from having the process quickly and correctly performed.</p><p xml:id="era1_130461">So it is all through the various ramifications of household science. The average woman actually knows so little that she has not yet discovered how much there is that she does NOT know. To spread the divine discontent with such <choice><sic>igorance</sic><corr>ignorance</corr></choice>, to open up new opportunities for gaining household knowledge, to exalt the high calling of the maker of homes--such is the noble work which I hope is to receive fresh impetus from the domestic science branch of the WOMAN'S ERA.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_02.14" type="Article"><head rend="center">Health and Beauty from Exercise.<lb/>PAPER NO. 1.</head><docAuthor>Mary P. Evans</docAuthor><byline>By MARY P. EVANS.</byline><p xml:id="era1_130462">Two important reasons exist for taking physical exercise. Health depends upon it and it strengthens body, mind and face, and beautifies them.</p><p xml:id="era1_130463">The person who takes no exercise, who performs no physical labor, who does not develop the muscles of the body, is, as a rule, weaker, less healthy, and more apt to contract diseases, than is the person who by physical exercise strengthens and develops the muscles.</p><p xml:id="era1_130464">Fortunate indeed is the girl endowed with beauty, grace and mind. She is a power, an influential centre around which constantly revolve opportunities for usefulness. These three are mutually dependent. The cultivation of one alone is done at the expense of the other two. And only by developing all does the well balanced, well proportioned and strong woman result. Very often the homeliest faced girl may obtain this proportion by regulated exercise and study. There is no royal road to a graceful, elegant body, as there is not to a cultured mind. <choice><sic>health results.</sic><corr>?</corr></choice></p><p xml:id="era1_130465">If the muscles of the back are weak and unable to keep it erect and to hinder a cramping of the abdominal organs, curvature or crookedness will result, and worse still, the spinal column will be weakened, and all or very many of the nervous diseases which come from a weak spine will follow as well as general debility, and the worse forms of nervous irritability.</p><p xml:id="era1_130466">Many people not born beautiful may become so by physical exercise, proper habits and mental and moral development. A beautiful face with a weak, unhealthy body is all object of pity, A strong, active mind burdened with such a body loses much of its power and usefulness. While a sound, healthy body without grace and uncontrolled by refinement and intelligence makes its owner but a little better than any other healthy animal.</p><p xml:id="era1_130467">If sufficient exercise is not taken, respiration, or breathing, is poor, and, as a result, the elastic wall of the chest is either not fully expanded or becomes abnormally contracted. The lungs from this cause are unable to supply the blood with oxygen, the great blood purifier, and consequently the surest means for disease of heart and lungs follow.</p><p xml:id="era1_130468">If the muscles of the abdomen are neglected and left undeveloped, they cannot aid in strengthening digestion and breathing. By digestion blood is formed from the food we eat, and if digestion is poor, the formation of healthy blood is hindered; and if the breathing is not strong and good, the blood is not purified, and bad<choice><sic/><corr>health results.</corr></choice> To acquire either requires hard, earnest work, much industry and courage.</p><p xml:id="era1_130469">A face was never made permanently beautiful by cosmetics. Wholesome, healthy beauty is from within. It cannot be secured by any system of veneer. Strong, sound lungs, healthy muscles and easy, graceful limbs cannot develop when confined in stays and girdles. The mind surrounded by narrow and bad influences becomes dwarfed and weakened. The soul which is broadened by contact with other souls, which feeds on noble thoughts, is quickened by noble deeds and aids in making the weak strong, and better and happier, will soften and often make beautiful the hard, unchiseled, and irregular lines of the homeliest face. Both body and soul must have room in which to grow and neither must be poisoned or weakened by drugs or evil surroundings.</p><p xml:id="era1_130470">Before speaking of the kind of exercise to be taken something must be said about food, ventilation of living rooms, dress and bathing.</p><p xml:id="era1_130471">Food makes blood and blood makes flesh and muscle. The better suited the food, the better will be the blood, the flesh and the muscle. Any food which weakens the digestive organs ought to be avoided. Too much greasy and highly spiced or very rich food is a great enemy to good digestion. Generally speaking, plain wholesome food which can be easily digested, and which contains sufficient nutriment, is the food which ought to he eaten at regular intervals.</p><p xml:id="era1_130473">The juices of meats contain the best nutrition,
		  and meats, beef, veal and fish, lose their value as
		  food in proportion to the destruction of this
		  nutrition by boiling and salting. Milk and eggs are

ily digested and good food, as are wheat, rice, potatoes, turnips, beets. carrots, parsnips and fruit. Chocolate or cocoa powdered and mixed with water or milk heated to the boiling point is refreshing and highly nutritious. All these foods are more or less valuable as blood and strength producers as they are properly or improperly prepared and eaten. The time of eating must be regular and the amount of food at each meal must be neither too much nor too little. As a general rule for an active person two and a half pounds of solid food and three pints of liquid food and three pints of water make a day's allowance.</p><p xml:id="era1_130474">The tone, the health and life of the human body are dependent upon the blood. And the health, the strength and life-giving quality of the blood depend upon the food we eat and the air we breathe. Air is mainly composed of nitrogen and oxygen, four parts of the former and one part of the-latter, And when air is deprived of its oxygen it will not support human life. And each time that the same air passes through the lungs it loses a part of its oxygen. The blood starts from the heart fresh and pure and strong. It goes through the arteries to various parts of the body, deposits its nutrition or flesh making qualities, and then goes back through the veins to the heart again. On its return before reaching the heart, it passes through the lungs and exchanges the carbonic acid gas which it has gathered in going about the body, and which will not support animal life, for oxygen, which is necessary to the support of animal life.</p><p xml:id="era1_130475">If the blood does not exchange its carbonic acid gas for <choice><sic>orygen</sic><corr>oxygen</corr></choice> when it goes through the lungs on its way back to the heart, it becomes sluggish, loses its tone and health and instead of carrying nutrition and health and life to all parts of the body, it carries poison and we quickly see the result in pale faces, physical weakness, nervousness, depressed spirits, sallow complexions, weak minds and stunted growth.</p><p xml:id="era1_130476">How different is the result of vigorous blood, full of oxygen and life. The person who breathes fresh air, not air already breathed by himself or other persons once or many times, will grow up strong, ruddy, active, with healthy body, skin and brain; and in condition for the very best physical and mental work.</p><p xml:id="era1_130477">Too much emphasis cannot be put upon the necessity for an abundance of pure, fresh air in the sleeping room, the sitting room, the school room, concert hall, lecture room, sick room, and wherever time is spent. Wearing apparel, bedding, rugs, carpets, and indeed every thing that can hold disease germs ought to be thoroughly aired each day.</p><p xml:id="era1_130478">Dressing is a matter of taste as well as health. One of the most satisfactory evidences of the progress of women is seen in the change from a style of tight lacing and tight dressing which cause the body to grow out of natural symmetry and grace, for a style of easy, comfortable and sensible dressing which allows the limbs to have free play and gives the blood a chance to circulate and flow to all parts of the body. Lacing and tight waists compress the liver and stomach and interfere with the movements of the diaphragm; this often causes headache, dyspepsia, shortness of breath, womb disease, weak back and many, many aches and pains. Women are beginning to learn that it is better to dress for health than for style, and, that the best dressing is that which aids and does not hinder healthy growth.</p><p xml:id="era1_130479">When taking physical <choice><sic>exereise</sic><corr>exercise</corr></choice> the dress should be light and loose, and so made that the limb can have free and easy play in all directions.</p><p xml:id="era1_130480">Any rule regulating bathing must be elastic. Too much bathing is as dangerous as too little is bad. Frequent cold water sponge baths properly taken are among the best aids to good health because they strengthen the skin and keep it free from the impurities which the body is constantly trying to throw off through the pores. The best time for the bath is immediately after rising because the body is then rested and the circulation is at the best. Bathing immediately before or after a meal should be avoided because the rubbing removes the blood from the stomach to the surface. Care must be taken to avoid the shock to a delicate organization given by cold water. Begin with the tepid bath and gradually work up to cold water. All vigorous physical exercise should be followed by a bath to remove the impurities brought to the surface, avoiding a bath while the body is too heated. Take it after the heart has begun to beat normally and follow it with brisk rubbing with a coarse towel.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_130481" n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_02.15" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_130482" rend="center">--ADVERTISE--<lb/>

This is deeply regretted by us and we feel that we must apologize to the many kind friends, who have received this venture with so much sympathy and enthusiasm. In spite of its late appearance and rather too frequent typographical errors, we think that we are justified in speaking of the many compliments upon the appearance of our <choice><sic>pape</sic><corr>paper</corr></choice> received by us. "Blowing one's own horn," vulgar as we consider it, is considered by many in this day and time, legitimate business. We have no intention, however, of indulging in this all too common pastime, but in the face of the almost eloquent silence with which our paper has been received by contemporaries, we feel that we must speak and express our gratitude for the enthusiastic personal endorsement received by us. For the rest, good work tells; we appeal to and expect to be supported by the strongest women of the country, women who will appreciate a high class paper and recognize one when seen.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_02.17" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">OUR WOMEN'S CLUBS.</head><p xml:id="era1_130489">The growth and development of women's clubs is little less than marvelous; thinking people who at first gave little attention to the movement, have been forced to stop and seriously consider the meaning of such an uprising. Organized woman is showing herself to be a tremendous power, and happily a power almost without exception for good.</p><p xml:id="era1_130490">In the general movement, the colored women of America have felt the quickening influence and are responding nobly. Washington, New York, Kansas City, Boston, Chicago, New Bedford, Providence, and Lawrence can all boast clubs of women organized for mutual improvement and for good works. The impulse and general plan of work of each of these leagues is the same, and yet, each adapts its work to the special needs of its members and its community, that this is so, shows the spontaneity and value of the movement.</p><p xml:id="era1_130491">This organization of colored women means much; through it our women are brought more closely in touch with the world and the great questions of the day; by organization, not only are their own minds and talents strengthened and developed, but they are enabled to give a helping hand to those less favored; through it the inspiration of congeniality is felt, besides this each organization is a strong factor for the general elevation of the race.</p><p xml:id="era1_130492">A certain independence of action in the leagues is admirable, but still, even here the power of organization should be recognized and used, a general interest in each other's work is not enough to gain the greatest power. To do the most good the leagues should be united to a certain degree.</p><p xml:id="era1_130493">The especial work of this paper, is the binding together of our women's clubs, to give a knowledge of the aims and works of each to help in every way their growth and advancement and bring the colored women together in great and powerful organization for the growth and progress of the race.

Tourgee proposed as a remedy to prevent the lynching of colored people at the South, that the country where lynchings occur be compelled by law to pension the wife and children of the murdered man. This, he said would make murder costly and in self defense the local authorities would put a stop to it. At first blush, this is an attractive suggestion. But why not hang the murderers? Why make a distinction between the murderers of white men and the murderers of colored men? If the punishment for murder is hanging why hang the murderer in one case and in the other let the murderer go free and exact of the county a fine? If an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth is the rule in one case why should it not be the rule in the other case? No, the truth is this, nothing is to be expected from the South. The colored people must look to the general government. It has a right to their services and lives in time of war. They have a right to its protection certainly in time of peace. It is idle to say that it must leave to state governments the protection of the lives of its citizens. Why not leave to state governments the punishment
<pb xml:id="era1_130494" n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
of counterfeiters? If the United States government can protect money, the property of its citizens against destruction at the hands of the counterfeiter, it can protect the owners of the property against loss of life at the hands of the murderer. It is an astounding proposition that a great nation is powerful enough to stop white <choice><sic>moonshines</sic><corr>moonshiners</corr></choice> from making whiskey but is unable to prevent the moonshiners or any one else from murdering its citizens. It can protect corn but cannot protect life. It can prevent the sale of tobacco unless the seller pays a revenue to the government but it cannot protect its citizens at any price. It can go to war, spend millions of dollars and sacrifice thousands of lives to avenge the death of a naturalized white citizen slain by a foreign government on foreign soil, but cannot spend a cent to protect a loyal, native-born colored American murdered without provocation by native or alien in Alabama. Shame on such a government! The administration in power is particeps criminis with the murderers. It can stop lynching, and until it does so, it has on its hands the innocent blood of its murdered citizens.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_02.19" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">TOURGEE IN BOSTON.</head><p xml:id="era1_130496">Whatever difference of opinion may exist as to the manner in which the telling blows of judge Tourgee were given in his recent Boston speech, all will agree that they were effective -in stirring up healthy discussion and even warm controversy among good friends of the cause he came to advocate. It is however only the old difference of means to a desired end. The methods of the christian soldier appeal most to one side, while those of the earnest student into cause and effect impress the other. Who shall say which is doing most? All kinds of methods are needed to be tried to meet the infinite <choice><sic>varity</sic><corr>variety</corr></choice> of objections to the human rights of the negro in this country. In their different ways both Judge Tourgee and Wm. Loyd Garrison are conscientiously playing their parts and both are proven friends of the needy negro. In the intense earnestness for the cause that absorbs him, that courageous champion Albion Tourgee rides rough shod to his mark. He wields a free lance and cuts right and left in placing the responsibility for the continued lawlessness of the South on the people of the North, black and white, for their apathy and indifference. Individuals churches and other organization, all came in for a share of the scathing rebuke of this wounded martyr to the cause of exact justice. If the words uttered by this man with a mission blunt and forceable as they were, shall prove effective in injecting some of his self-sacrificing ardor into the young man who now contents himself with only criticism of the ways and means used by those who are doing the work and bearing the odium of this unpopular cause, then may we hope for a speedy recognition of the futility of mere talk in the vindication of his race manhood.

Although several months have <choice><sic>elasped</sic><corr>elapsed</corr></choice> since its publication, it is worthy of special mention in a journal devoted to the interests of <choice><sic>colorod wemen</sic><corr>colored women</corr></choice>.</p><p xml:id="era1_130525">Miss Jefferson says very truly that the soul of civilization is incarnate in womankind, and the type finally assumed by any race of people can be best prophesied by a careful <choice><sic>stndy</sic><corr>study</corr></choice> of its superior womanhood. She advocates that the Negroes have an unquestioned right to all the opportunities of American citizenship, and speaks of what the Negro woman has endured through unknown centuries of paganism, and more than two centuries of bondage. She states that there are certain qualities that uniformly appear in the Negro women of the better sort. Among these she names the genius of good manners, a prodigious capacity for hard work, a boundless love for childhood and homemaking, and a natural love for the beautiful. The entire article is very encouraging, and cannot help but elevate Negro womanhood in the minds of all who may read it.</p><p xml:id="era1_130526">The old saying that "A prophet is not without honor save in his own country," does not apply to <choice><sic>Jndge</sic><corr>Judge</corr></choice> Tourgee. <choice><sic>Althongh</sic><corr>Although</corr></choice> not a native of North Carolina, he has been so long identified with that state that it is practically his home. And that he is not without honor is evidenced by the universal esteem and veneration with which he is regarded by the colored people of Greenboro and vicinity. He is unvariably referred to as a friend and benefactor of those persons with whom he has come in contact during his residence there, and they take great pride in pointing out his home to strangers.</p><p xml:id="era1_130527">Judge Tourgee possesses a thorough knowledge of human nature and sees clearly the motives that actuate men, and the causes that produce effects and events. He has, moreover, a genuine <choice><sic>symphathy</sic><corr>sympathy</corr></choice> for the oppressed, and that deep insight into character which classifies and discriminates between the individuals of a race that, is generally treated as a whole. Many of the characters of his early volumes are still living in the vicinity of his home, and the thrilling incidents related by him, are corroborated by the participants.</p><p xml:id="era1_130528">George W. Cable's new novel, "John March, Southerner," which is being published in serial form in Scribner's Magazine, deals with the same period of time as does several of Judge Tourgee's novels, the period of Reconstruction. These years, immediately following the close of the war, will furnish a subject for the novelist, the historian, the philosopher and the statesman for many years to come. </p><p xml:id="era1_130529">There is a revival of interest in Napoleon that is phenomenal in its extent and intensity. A distinguished Frenchman has remarked that "Napoleon has again hypnotised the French people." The Century will shortly publish a history of his life which contains much new <choice><sic>materal</sic><corr>material</corr></choice> furnished by lately discovered manuscripts and the latest developments of research. Thus far no history has appeared in either England or France that is wholly without malice, and which conforms to the laws of historical criticism. A full statement of his <choice><sic>carrer</sic><corr>career</corr></choice>, and its effect on subsequent history can be best written by an American whose judgement would be uninfluenced by <choice><sic>partizanship</sic><corr>partisanship</corr></choice>.</p><p xml:id="era1_130530">Although the reading of light novels may be a frivolous waste of time, and if carried to excess positively harmful, yet a wholesome light story is both refreshing and restful, <choice><sic>epecially</sic><corr>especially</corr></choice> to those whose reading is in the line of study. It paints a picture that quickly fades into indistinctness, but leaves behind a pleasant impression. A few light novels wisely interposed between serious study, break the current of habitual thought and invite a return to more normal and less strained conditions of mind. They who can take the novel of the day for what it is worth and make the right use of it, have learned that the mind needs recreation as truly as the body needs exercise. But this is a good habit that can very easily become a bad one.</p><p xml:id="era1_130531">At a recent meeting of Sorosis the question was discussed whether fairy stories should be told to children. Many were of the opinion that they did more harm than good; yet there were many who made a strong plea for them. It seems a pity that childhood should be robbed of its fondest delusions, but the children who in this practical age really believe in <choice><sic>faries</sic><corr>fairies</corr></choice> are few indeed. In the case of a nervous child who would be haunted in the dark by visions of unfriendly imaginary folks, the harm might be averted if the storyteller would take pains to impress upon the mind of the little one that it was all "only make-believe."</p><p xml:id="era1_130532">In reading the Literary Passions of Mr. Howells, one cannot help but notice at what an early age he was reading the best literature. This seems to be true of most of the men who became eminent in afterlife. We find The Pilgrim's Progress and Fox's Book of Martyrs among the first books read by several of our leaders in <choice><sic>thouht ;g</sic><corr>thought; </corr></choice> books that the youth of today find far from interesting or entertaining reading. This may be due not so much to the difference in taste, as to the fact that entertaining reading matter is much more easily obtained now than it was earlier in the century. And since the best literature can be obtained as easily as that of an inferior quality it is the duty of every one to see that young people read the best from the beginning.</p><p xml:id="era1_130533">The millions who reverence the name of William Lloyd Garrison will heartily welcome the story of his life as told by his children.

They were not particularly interested in any one subject, but thought the hours spent in desultory reading might be made <choice><sic>prufitable</sic><corr>profitable</corr></choice> as well as pleasurable.</p><p xml:id="era1_130536">They agreed to meet once a <choice><sic>fr tnigh</sic><corr>fortnight</corr></choice> to discuss whatever work they <choice><sic>migh</sic><corr>might</corr></choice> have read in the meantime.</p><p xml:id="era1_130538">The first book assigned, was "The Scarlet Letter" because it is classed as one of, if not the very best, of novels. Copies of the Salem Edition of the
<pb xml:id="era1_130537" n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
book were purchased for the small sum of eighteen cents and each member of the class read it before the initial meeting.</p><p xml:id="era1_130539">At that meeting, one read a short sketch of the life of Nathaniel Hawthorne; another, an article on Brook Farm Community; whilst others read short impressions of different characters in the story.</p><p xml:id="era1_130540">Fortunately, at that time Richard Mansfield was playing at one of the leading, theatres, and "The Scarlet Letter" was in his <choice><sic>repertore</sic><corr>repertoire</corr></choice>. The girls attended the play and although the story, being the history of a <choice><sic>hnman</sic><corr>human</corr></choice> heart, is absolutely incapable of being adequately dramatized, still the times, in which the tale is located, are accurately portrayed by the drama in question.</p><p xml:id="era1_130541">When the book was discussed, we had various opinions on its merits. (I think young people are perhaps after all the truest critics. They are not apt to be biased by the opinions of this or that eminent writer, and go at once to the root of the matter for themselves.)</p><p xml:id="era1_130542">One girl could see no reason why it should be classed among the great novels. She thought it morbid and dull, showing, evidently, she preferred mere narrative to minute dissections of a human conscience. Another girl could find no words to equal her admiration for this really fine book and read extract after extract of the best passages.</p><p xml:id="era1_130543">The paper on Brook Farm led to a discussion on communities in general, and the club decided to devote some time to searching for information on that subject.</p><p xml:id="era1_130544">Some of the books suggested for reading were Plato's "Ideal Republic," Sir Thomas Moore's "<choice><sic>Utophia</sic><corr>Utopia</corr></choice>," Bulwers Lytton's "Coming Race," Bellamy' "Looking Backwards," Life of Laurence Oliphant," "The Oneida Community," and a visit was planned for the coming summer, to the Shaker settlement a few miles from our city.</p><p xml:id="era1_130545">The members decided to read at least one half-hour each day or pay a small fine for every day omitted. The money was to be used in purchasing new books.</p><p xml:id="era1_130546">At the second meeting, "Adam Bede," by George Elliot was discussed.</p><p xml:id="era1_130547">Each member reported not only having read the required time, but so interested had they become in the work on hand, that they had spent a great deal of time in the libraries.</p><p xml:id="era1_130548">One read a paper on George Elliot's two marriages; another, on George Lewes' life and works; still, another read extracts from George Elliot's "Life and Letters" by Cross, her second husband.</p><p xml:id="era1_130549">These papers were crude, faulty and perhaps anything but well written, but they aimed only to give information for if 'reading makes the full man' certainly 'writing makes the exact one.'</p><p xml:id="era1_130550">An article on "Dinah" brought up the subject of women as preachers. Much was said pro and con on the subject and finally, the club decided to subscribe to "The Woman's Column" so that they might know what women were doing everywhere.</p><p xml:id="era1_130551">Time nor space will not allow me to report each meeting but enough has been said to show the plan of the work in which this class is engaged.</p><p xml:id="era1_130552">During the winter among the works read and discussed were "Romola," "Life of Savanola," Auerbach's "On the Height," "Henry Esmond" "Life of Thackeray," and Prof. Horsford's "Norumbega."</p><p xml:id="era1_130553">A marked improvement was noted in the papers submitted to the club, some of them reaching the dignity of being considered well written essays and accepted as such, in their school tasks.</p><salute>Yours,</salute><signed>LESLIE WILMOT.</signed></div><div xml:id="era1_02.23" type="Article"><head rend="center">WOMEN AT HOME.</head><docAuthor>M.

ELIZABETH JOHNSON.</byline><head rend="center">SOCIAL ETIQUETTE.</head><p xml:id="era1_130554">Among many residents of our large cities who do not pose as or desire to be "au fait" society people and yet who take pleasure in the small enjoyments of calling and entertaining, it is often a problem just how much formality should be regarded by them towards their friends. It is often thought that the simplicity of their mode of living precludes the necessity of conformation to the rigid laws established by Dame Etequette in this particular; at least, it is so thought for a time, but eventually comes the interruption just in the midst of some important household duty too, that makes us realize that the inconvenience experienced has been self caused, the root of the evil lying at our own door and being nothing less than the thoughtless, friendly invitation to "call at any time," accentuated by a more or less added protestation against formality. Now all of us know that strict, rigid formality would mar the pleasure of any friendly call, but there are a few by-laws, the knowledge of which is essential to make any call a pleasure. So, the next time the unwelcome interruption comes, instead of having the usual behind the scene monologue, and each woman knows just how impressive a performance that can be made, suppose we reason with ourselves along the following lines, and see if the observance of a few social laws will not make life smoother.</p><p xml:id="era1_130555">Each woman should have a certain day or days when she is at home to visitors. This designated on the visiting card is all that is necessary.</p><p xml:id="era1_130556">Immediate friends who share the privilege of unlimited entree should remember that each day or some part of it, has its duties. That if dinner is served at six, the call for a chat should not come at five minutes of six. That if <choice><sic>nusery</sic><corr>nursery</corr></choice> duties must be attended to at seven, half past seven is a better hour to call than half past six. In fact it has long ago ceased to be the vogue for even one's intimate friends to "drop in." Wisdom, which comes with years, has taught people that no friend is so intimate that there may not be times when she is unwelcome, and one's dearest and nearest bow to the law which suggests the paying of a visit at a time when one's friend's are ready to receive.</p><p xml:id="era1_130557">If you have planned a certain afternoon to see your friends no announcement of their arrival is necessary. You are simply ready to see them. Be sure and dress <choice><sic>ueatly</sic><corr>neatly</corr></choice> on such occasions. A house dress consisting of a fancy waist and plain skirt being always in good taste. A tea gown is <choice><sic>permissable</sic><corr>permissible</corr></choice> but it must not have the appearance of <choice><sic>negligie</sic><corr>negligee</corr></choice>, and a street dress can be worn with approval.</p><p xml:id="era1_130558">The custom of serving refreshments is being regarded with disfavor; the at home day is arranged so that one may surely see one's friends, and these friends come not to dine, but to have a little talk, to announce that one is not forgotten, and then to depart without having caused the hostess any worry or put her to any great expense.</p><p xml:id="era1_130559">When calling on sick friends, it is not always well to see them; an inquiry is sufficient, or if not too ill the friend might appreciate your good wishes sent to her on your visiting card.</p><p xml:id="era1_130560">This is only a little talk on some of the more apparent stumbling blocks, large enough to make it worth while to remove them, and therefore gain an equal proportion of comfort and happiness.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_130561" n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_02.24" type="Social_Notes"><head rend="center">SOCIAL NEWS.</head><docAuthor>Irene Demortie</docAuthor><docAuthor>Marion Ridley</docAuthor><byline>IRENE DEMORTIE -- MARION RIDLEY.</byline><p xml:id="era1_130562">The Easter Reception held at Berkley Hall on the evening of the 28th of March, was in every way a success.

A prettier sight has seldom been witnessed than the one presented on Thursday, Children's Day. The little ones, <choice><sic>daintly</sic><corr>daintily</corr></choice> attired, danced, marched, and played games to their hearts' content.

These concerts, which are never widely advertised and therefore take the form of semi-private affairs, attract the most cultivated and critical music lovers; the fact that the audience was as large as usual despite the fact that on the same evening the Handel and Hayden society was giving Elijah in celebration of the thirtieth anniversary of the directorship of Carl Zarrahn, attests to the esteem in which Mr. Jameison is held among musical artists and students. Upon this occasion Mr. Jameison was assisted by Mr. Win. Barton Robinson, basso and Mr. J. C. Manning accompanist. The first number on the programme, concert (No. 2) by Saint Saens (two movements) with the orchestral part played by Mr. Manning opened the concert auspiciously. Mr. Jameison interpreted this number with great <choice><sic>breath</sic><corr>breadth</corr></choice> of style <choice><sic>aud</sic><corr>and</corr></choice> clean cut <choice><sic>techinque</sic><corr>technique</corr></choice>, the two magnificent Steinways responding to every demand made on them.</p><p xml:id="era1_130582">The difficulties of this composition were happily met by the artist and the individuality with which it was rendered made this eminent French composer's work most enjoyable in the hearing.</p><p xml:id="era1_130583">Mr. Jameison's other numbers consisted of a group of compositions by Edward Schutt, Rubinstein and the Rhapsodies Hongroise No. 15 by Liszt.</p><p xml:id="era1_130584">In all of these Mr. Jameison reflected great credit on himself, never having appeared to better advantage than on this occasion the result of his hard and constant study being always en evidence.</p><p xml:id="era1_130585">The audience was large and <choice><sic>enthusiasic</sic><corr>enthusiastic</corr></choice>, and although the colored people present were comparatively few (a fact to be regretted) they represented Boston's solid social worth and that exclusiveness which is brought out only on rare occasions.</p><p xml:id="era1_130586">At the Tourgee lecture the other evening Mr. Sydney Woodward sang "The Star Spangled Banner" in his usual acceptable syle, but the sentiment of the Song brought out a scathing rebuke from <choice><sic>he</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> courageous judge who declared that if there was anything more false and stupid than a white man calling this the land of the free and the home of the brave could be found in a black man doing it.

"Don't he always go to the office past Jane Myrtle's cottage. To be sure it is the shortest way, but John never used to mind a walk, and then he said he had to visit her school lately. Of course he is one of the school committee, still there are other schools besides the one Jane Myrtle teaches. Now,--yes, now I think of it many things prove that he is false. Didn't he say that plain bonnets were more becoming than gaudy ones, and quoted Jane Myrtle as an example. How blind I've been."</p><p xml:id="era1_130612">Mr. Brougham, on his way home stopped and bought his wife a set of garnets she had long admired. He entered the house intending to give his wife the ornaments and say something about their wedding day which was not long ago, either. Full of these thoughts he entered, and when he found no dinner prepared he became seriously alarmed.</p><p xml:id="era1_130613">"What can be the matter?" he asked himself.</p><p xml:id="era1_130614">"Why, Maria, what has happened?" he inquired, on finding her sitting disconsolate before the stove. He thought she had either heard of the sudden death of some of her relatives or was seriously ill.</p><p xml:id="era1_130615">At the sound of his voice, Mrs. Brougham started to her feet and the most casual observer would have noticed how deathly pale she was and Mr. Brougham, who was well acquainted with her, saw at once that a storm was about to burst, for what reason he knew not.</p><p xml:id="era1_130616">"Are you sick?" he asked helplessly.</p><p xml:id="era1_130617">"Sick! yes, sick at heart," she answered, "but what more had I to expect?" "Why did you take me a happy, innocent girl from my father's house to be insulted in this manner? I'm sorry I ever saw you."</p><p xml:id="era1_130618">"Maria, what is the meaning of this? Have you suddenly lost your senses?"</p><p xml:id="era1_130619">"O yes, lost my senses! Probably Jane Myrtle had not lost hers."</p><p xml:id="era1_130620">"What has Jane Myrtle to do with it? I cannot imagine her acting in this inexplicable manner."</p><p xml:id="era1_130621">"That's right. Do take her part. Just what I expected!" and Mrs. Brougham burst into tears.</p><p xml:id="era1_130622">"I repeat that I am utterly at a loss to understand what you mean," replied Mrs. Brougham.</p><p xml:id="era1_130623">"O, you cruel, hard-hearted villain, nothing is too cruel for you to do or say," answered his wife.</p><p xml:id="era1_130624">"What have I done?" again demanded Mr. Brougham, in an angry tone.</p><p xml:id="era1_130625">"Done?" again replied Mrs. Brougham, as the memory of her wrongs came over her, she lost control over herself and bestowed epithet after epithet upon Mr. Brougham. He lost his temper also and a violent quarrel ensued which ended in his saying that she might return to her father as soon as she liked and apply for a divorce at once, in fact the sooner, the better. Taking up his hat, he went out and slammed the door.</p><p xml:id="era1_130626">So the day begun so auspiciously, bid fair to end disastrously enough, owing to the wind and a meddlesome busybody. Mrs. Brougham went to her chamber and began preparing for her departure.</p><p xml:id="era1_130627">"I shall return home," she kept repeating; "but first I'll let Jane Myrtle know what I think of her." Mrs. Brougham therefore, dressed herself as carefully as if she was going to make a ceremonious call and started for Miss Myrtle's cottage.</p><p xml:id="era1_130628">Within a few rods of the house, she met her nephew.</p><p xml:id="era1_130629">"Whither bound this windy day?" he inquired.</p><p xml:id="era1_130630">"I am going to make a call," she answered compressing her lips.</p><p xml:id="era1_130631">Just then a gust of wind coming around a corner nearly took them off their feet, and blowing off Mrs. Brougham's veil lodged it in the snow.</p><p xml:id="era1_130632">Her nephew caught it, returned it to her and remarked, "The wind seems to have a grudge against your family. You ought to have seen Uncle John this morning, the wind blew away his pocket handkerchief and he stood looking up and down just as if he could not think what had become of it."</p><p xml:id="era1_130633">"Where were you,?<choice><sic/><corr>"</corr></choice> inquired Mrs. Brougham, eagerly.</p><p xml:id="era1_130634">"Home," looking out of the window he answered.</p><p xml:id="era1_130635">Then a bright thought entered Mrs. Brougham's head that perhaps Miss Myrtle found the article the wind blew away but she rejected it instantly.</p><p xml:id="era1_130636">(TO BE CONTINUED.)</p></div><div xml:id="era1_02.29" type="Announcement"><head rend="center">CHILDREN'S MAY FESTIVAL.</head><docAuthor>Eva Lewis</docAuthor><p xml:id="era1_130637" rend="center">ODD FELLOW'S' HALL'</p><p xml:id="era1_130638" rend="center">North Russell Street.</p><p xml:id="era1_130639" rend="center">TUESDAY MAY 1 ST '94</p><p xml:id="era1_130640">Solo Dancing,<lb/>

Cheney</docAuthor><byline>EDNAH D. CHENEY.</byline><p xml:id="era1_130673">Among the most important and successful of the movements of the "Women's Era" is that for opening the Medical profession to Women. I cannot take space enough to narrate the whole history of this interesting movement, which was heralded by the brave work of a few pioneers like Harriot K. Hunt, Elizabeth Blackwell and others, and which has now spread through the civilized world, but I wish to give only a few facts in regard to an institution in our own city which has done a great work for the education of women, as well as for enlightened charity on the broadest principles.</p><p xml:id="era1_130674">It is not the first hospital of this kind in the country, being antedated by a few years, by the New-York Infirmary, and the Hospital connected with the medical college of Philadelphia. It has been followed by the establishment of a large number of hospitals in various parts of the Union, most of which trace their origin directly to the influence to one or other of these three institutions.</p><p xml:id="era1_130675">The New England Hospital grew out of a clinical department in the Old Female Medical College but was established as an entirely independent institution in 1862. This was during the civil war when the public interest was absorbed in the struggle for the preservation of the Union and the emancipation of the Slave. It started without any resources but a little furniture, its brave enthusiastic physician, Dr. M.E. Zakrzewska, and the unlimited faith of its founders in the goodness of their cause and the liberality of New England.</p><p xml:id="era1_130676">The Hospital was incorporated in 1863 and the three women who are named in the act of incorporation are all living, after a period of thirty one years to rejoice in its success.</p><p xml:id="era1_130677">Its object cannot be more briefly stated than in the words of the original By-Laws.</p><p xml:id="era1_130678">1st.-To provide for women medical aid of competent physicians of their own sex.</p><p xml:id="era1_130679">2nd.-To assist educated women in the practical study of medicine.</p><p xml:id="era1_130680">3d.-To train nurses for the care of the sick.</p><p xml:id="era1_130681">These purposes have been strictly carried out.</p><p xml:id="era1_130682">One great incidental good has been the lessening of the prejudice against Hospital treatment in the minds of the poor. So many of the poor women suffering from chronic maladies have found comfort and help from the care of physicians of their own sex, and the administration of the hospital has been so simple and homelike in its character, that women are ready to receive help here that they cannot have in their own homes.</p><p xml:id="era1_130683">I am glad to say that this feeling is not confined to women's hospitals, for the improvement in all hospitals has made them acceptable to the general public, but I still think that the woman physician has had a large influence in producing this good result.</p><p xml:id="era1_130684">The surgical work of the Hospital has been especially important and interesting, and many a woman has been restored to the work and enjoyment of life through the help she has received. The great modern improvements in surgery which have made life saving operations safe, which were considered "unjustifiable," thirty years ago, have made, this a most satisfactory branch of the profession.</p><p xml:id="era1_130686">The Maternity work has outgrown its original limits and is now carried on in a new building appropriately dedicated to two of the greatest benefactors of the cause, Sam'l E. Sewall who as a director of the old
<pb xml:id="era1_130685" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
college was the first to insist upon clinical instruction for Women Physicians, and the one who secured the inestimable services of Dr. Zakrzewska; and his noble daughter, Lucy E. Sewall who was first student and afterwards President and Attending Physician of the Hospital, and who served until her death as Attending and advisory Physician.</p><p xml:id="era1_130687">One of the great needs of the management is now that of a new surgical pavilion in which the surgeons can work with the help of all modern conveniences.</p><p xml:id="era1_130688">The object of training nurses was never lost sight of. This was the first effort in the United States to put this branch of education on a thorough basis, and it was mainly to the fine organizing talent of the lamented Dr Susan Dimoch, that it was indebted for its success. Since that time many similar institutions have been established throughout the country, until now almost every Hospital in the country has one connected with it. The good accomplished by these schools is very great, they give to the Physician and surgeon a trained ally who can carry out his orders intelligently, and thus often enable him to make fewer visits and yet treat the case more efficiently. The comfort to the patient is inestimable, and anxious friends have a helper whose skill and fidelity is guaranteed by those who have long watched her course.</p><p xml:id="era1_130689">Another incidental advantage of both the Hospital and the Training School is the instruction thus given to the families of the patients, in the care of the sick, and the principles of Hygiene.</p><p xml:id="era1_130690">But while joyfully recounting the admirable work done by other hospitals and training schools in our city and elsewhere, I am afraid that the New England stands alone in her honorable record of entire and equal justice to all races and colors. She has always received patients of every race, and the Negro, the Indian, the Anglo Saxon, and I believe the Malay have been seen lying side by side in their little beds receiving each the same tender and loving care.</p><p xml:id="era1_130691">When a colored girl applied for admission to the training school it was feared by that the existing prejudices might cause a feeling that would be injurious to the patients, but the Directors refused to take counsel of such fears and quietly carried out their own broad views. Since that time, some seventeen years ago, many colored pupils have been admitted to the school after passing the usual careful investigation into their character and attainments.</p><p xml:id="era1_130692">I am happy to say that these pupils have been up to the average of the school in their standing as pupils, and in one or two cases, at least, have been superior in their qualifications, and have held high positions in the school. In no instance, to my knowledge, has there been any objection made by patients to them on account of their color; on the contrary they have often been decided favorites.</p><p xml:id="era1_130693">While I am very anxious to extend this work among the colored people both at the North and the South, believing that it is a noble profession for which they are well adapted, I wish to add a caution that it is one that requires superior character and intelligence, and a good thorough English education. It is very desirable that candidates should be graduates of high schools.</p><p xml:id="era1_130694">It is especially important that colored nurses should have good education and previous training, because they will be much needed for superintendents of Training schools in the institutions at the South.</p><p xml:id="era1_130695">Colored pupils have also been received as internes or resident students of Medicine. All internes must have the diploma of a college in good standing. The East Indian, Dr. Joshee, was received by exceptional favor for a few months, but unfortunately her health failed and she was obliged to leave.</p><p xml:id="era1_130696">The Hospital is, open to visitors between two and four o'clock p.m., and the Superintendent will be happy to give full information in regard to it.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_03.03" type="Article"><head rend="center">THE DRINK TRAFFIC VS. LABOR.</head><docAuthor>Jessie Forsyth</docAuthor><byline>JESSIE FORSYTH.</byline><p xml:id="era1_130698">The liquor traffic in all its worst features is an especial outrage upon the decent poor. The vice of drinking is not confined to the lower order of society. It is not the working man who supports the barrooms attached to expensive hotels or the fashionable restaurants. And it is a fact that the thousands who make up
<pb xml:id="era1_130697" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the membership of the various temperance organizations are almost entirely of the working class.</p><p xml:id="era1_130699">But the sober working man is compelled to suffer from the annoying and degrading neighborhood of the saloon, with its offensive and revolting sights and sounds and odors. Writing in the <hi rend="italic">Atlantic Monthly</hi> a few years since, George Frederick Parsons says:--"The prosperous taxpayer, who grumbles at the levies made upon wine, may be thankful that his bank account secures him at least partial freedom from the worst products of the saloon. The poor mechanic, whose narrow earnings compel him to accept the <hi rend="italic">life of the tenement house,</hi> cannot shelter himself in the same way. He may be a temperate man himself. He may be a Christian. He may be desirous of raising his family respectably, and of keeping them untainted. But the polluting contiguity which poverty compels makes him an involuntary witness and auditor of all the brutalities and obscenities provoked by drink in the most depraved of his neighbors, and he cannot keep from the ears of his wife or daughters sights and sounds, which in themselves constitute infection."</p><p xml:id="era1_130700">It is <hi rend="italic">the vote of the wealthy class</hi> which is largely responsible for the forcing of the liquor traffic upon the community. It is an acknowledged fact that at the city election of 1892 it was the vote of the Back Bay district which prevented Boston from obtaining a majority in favor of "no license." If the right of local option were extended so as to cover the wards and precincts of the city, and the citizens who vote to license the rum shops were compelled to have them in their own districts, a large proportion of the saloons would be found in the aristocratic quarters of Boston instead of as at present being crowded into the poorer localities.</p><p xml:id="era1_130701">It is an obvious injustice that the poor man should have the saloon forced upon him by the rich man's vote.</p><p xml:id="era1_130702">Another injustice to the well-doing poor, is the fact that the working class, as a whole, is very often judged by the conduct of the meanest and lowest specimen, Often <hi rend="italic">an excuse for keeping wages down</hi> is found in the fact that many men spend a large proportion of their earnings in drink.</p><p xml:id="era1_130703">Again, the man of dissipated habits, no matter what his skill may be, is forced, in order to retain employment at all, to accept work at any price. There are employers who are not slow to avail themselves of this fact, and too often the sober workman finds the price of his labor reduced by reason of the bad habits of his fellow craftsman.</p><p xml:id="era1_130704">It has become the common usage to make excuses for drinking among the lower classes on the plea that they are driven to it by their poverty. "Let him drink and forget his woe," it is said. I sometimes wonder whether a little of the sympathy given to the working man, whose hard conditions have driven him to drink, would not be better bestowed upon his wife and children, whose miseries are augmented by every dram which he takes to drown his own.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_03.04" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_130705"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we131.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 3.

Special aptitude, as well as education is necessary, the nurse should be a good reliable woman, firm, kind and gentle, able to carry out orders with discretion, be cheerful and even tempered, having a love for her work. If she loves her work and is qualified, it would be better to have her even not trained, because often trained nurses are a failure in this branch. Appearances of disease are alike in children, and they (the children) act themselves, and we are able to tell by their actions the seat of their pain.</p><p xml:id="era1_130713">If the love and confidence of the child are won, it is easier
<pb xml:id="era1_130712" n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
to manage it, and this promotes its well-being and improvement. Power not only to observe, but ability to interpret observation is very necessary. Always find out the most important symptoms and indications; the position, appearance and manner of the child are indicative, and the physician relies on the nurse for these.</p><p xml:id="era1_130714">The care of a spoiled child is very hard work; if it were in a hospital it would naturally do as the other children. If the child will not take the medicine or nourishment, the nurse must insist, and compel him to do so. It is better to be truthful and tell the child you are going to hurt him, rather than pretend you are not, when you know better. If the medicine is unpleasant, tell the child before giving it, under no conditions deceive him or let him lose confidence in you.</p><p xml:id="era1_130715">The less he is handled the better: the room where he is sick ought to be light and sunny, with good ventilation, cheerful and pretty. Everything unnecessary ought to be removed, carpets taken up, the medicines, utensils, and plenty of hot water ought to be kept in a little adjoining room. A small oil-stove is always convenient for the use of the nurse. Assume control of the room, do not allow too many to be over it, only one head is necessary. Illness is more visible in children than older people as their organism is delicate and reacts quicker. They generally become <hi rend="italic">suddenly</hi> ill, and either <hi rend="italic">suddenly</hi> improve or die. There is seldom any lingering. In the simplest trouble temperature generally rises and vomiting occurs; other children ought to be kept away. The sick child ought to be lightly fed, bowels attended to. When a medical attendant is called tell the <hi rend="italic">symptoms,</hi> order of development, severe or not, <hi rend="italic">dejections</hi> and <hi rend="italic">urine.</hi> Take temperature always by rectum; pulse and respiration when asleep; a slow pulse is more ominous than a quick one, it may possibly be caused by brain pressure.</p><p xml:id="era1_130716">Subjective symptoms, those which we see, crying, colic, blue color of the mouth. In lung trouble there are low, short moans, a raising of shoulders and head. Sharp screams generally indicate brain trouble. In abdominal trouble the legs are drawn up, the child generally lying on his back. In brain and spinal diseases there is stiffness of the head, muscles of the neck drawn back. Observe closely the condition of the body when undressed, in all cases, for scarlet fever or measles may-be the trouble.</p><p xml:id="era1_130717">If he is to be examined, have him already when the doctor comes, the clothing loosened, and a warm blanket to put the child in, also warm towels for use. Don't let him see the preparations; never let him see hot applications, leeches, etc. Cover the leech with cotton if you have occasion to use it, and when it drops off, bathe well the bitten part, and bandage.</p><p xml:id="era1_130718">Enemas are given for diarrhoea and constipation; also for food, in cases where the child cannot take it by mouth. Always keep a baby clean, bathe every day, have everything around it clean. A draw sheet is a great help. For a bath, put a tub of water, the right temperature, covered with a sheet, into the room where the bath is to be given, after the child has been prepared, then lower the sheet into the water with him on it.

When a sponge bath has to be given, just turn him from side to side, in so doing you will prevent bed sores.

FANNIE HARRIER WILLIAMS,</salute><address><addrLine>Chicago, Ill.</addrLine></address></opener><p xml:id="era1_130731">The good women of Boston are deserving of much praise for the largeness of heart and outlook so happily shown in the creation and publication of the WOMAN'S ERA. At the very time when race interest seems at such a low ebb, when our leaders seem tongue-tied, dazed and stupidly inactive in the presence of unchecked lawlessness, and violent resistance to Negro advancement, it is especially fortunate and reassuring to see and feel the rallying spirit of our women voicing itself in words of hope, courage and high resolves in a journal that seems to spring out of the very heart and peculiar needs of our women.</p><p xml:id="era1_130732">I know of no publication having for its existence and possibilities such inspirations and rare opportuneness as your bright journal. The WOMAN'S ERA is the face of our colored women turned upward to the star of hope. It is the timely message of love and sympathy from colored women to women everywhere. It happily suggests that we can do so much for each other in all the most important interests of our lives, that we will have more time and reason for courage than for despair. To thousands of our women your paper will come as the first intimation of the wideness of the world about them and the stretch of human interest and sympathy. Thousands of them will discover their own strength and a certain sense of importance in this gradual coming together of our women all over the land in clubs and leagues organized for high purposes.</p><p xml:id="era1_130733">Referring to the proposition of holding a convention or congress of colored women's clubs, I feel like suggesting a word of caution against too much eagerness for mere spectacular demonstration of our present enthusiasm for good works. It must readily occur to the more thoughtful readers of the WOMAN'S ERA that large conferences of women inexperienced in the functions of deliberative bodies and without well defined and settled policies of action would be fraught with as many possibilities of evil as of good. We should be careful to avoid the examples of our colored men, whose innumerable Conventions, Councils and Conferences during the last twenty-five years have all begun in talk and ended in talk. We should not degrade our own high purposes into what as yet must be a mere imitation of the methods and work of long established Woman's Clubs. I believe that it is possible for us to work out, define and pursue a kind of club work that will be original, peculiarly suitable to our peculiar needs and that will distinguish our work essentially from the white women's clubs.</p><p xml:id="era1_130734">But I do not want to be understood as opposing a convention of colored women's clubs, or underestimating the large benefits that could certainly result from a conference of our representative women. But having in mind the many and peculiar weaknesses that have too frequently brought the meetings of some of the most intelligent women of the country into ill-repute, I believe it would be wiser for us to postpone the holding of such a conference two or three years, or until we are able to make such a conference impressive and grandly significant by a display of thoughtfulness, definiteness of purpose, and the presentation of facts and figures relative to work done and planned to be done. By extending in every direction the organization of these leagues or clubs, by bringing into them every good and capable woman, and by educating ourselves in all the more important needs of our home and social life, we shall be able in two or three years to startle the country by a surprising exhibition of good sense, intelligent self-interest and dignity of purpose.</p></body></floatingText></div><div xml:id="era1_03.08" type="News"><head rend="center">NEWS FROM THE CLUBS.</head><div xml:id="era1_03.08.01" type="News"><head rend="center">PROVIDENCE, R.I.</head><p xml:id="era1_130738">On April 15 the women of Providence met with Mrs. Brown of John street and organized the Sojourner South Club for their mutual improvement and development.

LAURA ORMISTON CHANT.</p><floatingText xml:id="era1_130750"><body xml:id="era1_130748"><opener><salute>Dear Mrs. Ormiston Chant:</salute></opener><p xml:id="era1_130742">One year ago this month the members of the Woman's Era Club of Boston, Mass., were privileged to have you address them as a body. The occasion was the first public meeting of the club and besides yourself, Mrs. Lucy Stone, Mrs. Cheney, Mrs. Diaz and Mrs. Spaulding spoke. It is safe to say that of all these noble women and fine speakers, no one did more than yourself in strengthening the impulse to good works, in giving fresh inspiration towards right living. Your name and that speech has been to us refreshing memory; think then the shock it has occasioned us to hear that through your efforts, a resolution at the National Conference of the Unitarian church, denouncing lynching, was defeated.</p><p xml:id="era1_130743">We feel assured and do truly believe that you opposed the resolution from a high moral standpoint, but we also feel assured that your position on this subject is the result of influences entirely one-sided, and that you will it least be interested to hear the other side.</p><p xml:id="era1_130744">We, the members of the Women's Era Club, believe we speak for the colored women of America. We have organized, as have our women everywhere, to help in the world's work, not only by endeavoring to uplift ourselves and our race, but by giving a helping hand and an encouraging word wherever they may be called for. As colored women, we have suffered and do suffer too much to be blind to the <choice><sic>snfferings</sic><corr>sufferings</corr></choice> of others, but naturally, we are more keenly alive to our own sufferings than to others', and we feel that we would be false to ourselves, to our opportunities and to our race, should we keep silence in a case like this. We have endured much, and we believe with patience, we have seen our old, broken-down wanderers, their youth and strength spent in bondage. We, ourselves, are daily hindered and oppressed in the race of life; we know that every opportunity for advancement, for peace and for happiness will be denied us; we know that in most sections Christian men and women will absolutely refuse not only to live beside us, to eat with us, but also to open their church doors to us; we know that our children, no matter with what tenderness they may be reared, are considered legitimate prey for insult; we know that our young girls can at any time be thrust into foul and filthy smoking cars; no matter what their straits, refused food and shelter if sought among whites in many sections. We feel deeply the lack of opportunities, for the culture brought by the public libraries, the concert and lecture halls which are everywhere denied us at the South. We view these thing., with amazement, but realizing that prejudice can only be eliminated by time and our general progress, we have tried to bear these indignities put upon us by a professedly Christian people with the fortitude and dignity of real Christians. All this we have borne and do bear with more or less patience, but in the interest of common humanity, in the interest of justice, for the good name of our country, we solemnly raise our voices against the horrible crimes of lynch law as practised in the South, and we call upon Christians everywhere to do the same, or be branded as sympathizers with the murderers.</p><p xml:id="era1_130745">We here solemnly deny that the black men are the foul fiends they are pictured; we demand that until at least one crime is <hi rend="italic">proved</hi> upon them, judgment be suspended.</p><p xml:id="era1_130746">We know positively of case after case where innocent men have died horrible deaths; we know positively of cases that have been "made up"; we know positively of cases where black men have been lynched for white men's crimes. We know positively of black men murdered for insignificant offences. All that we ask for is justice, not mercy or palliation, simple justice, surely that is not too much for loyal citizens of a free country to demand. We do not pretend to say there are no black <choice><sic>villians</sic><corr>villains</corr></choice>; baseness is not confined to race; we read with horror of two different colored girls who have recently been horribly assaulted by white men in the South. We should regret any lynchings of the offenders by black men, but we shall not have occasion; should these offenders receive any punishment, it will be a marvel. We do not brand the white race because of these many atrocities committed by white men, but because lynch law is not visited upon this class of offenders, we repudiate the claim that lynching is the natural and commendable outburst of a high-spirited people.</p><p xml:id="era1_130747">We do not expect white women shall feel as deeply as we. We know of good and high-minded women made widows, of sweet and innocent children, fatherless, by a mob of unbridled men and boys "looking for fun." In their name we utter our solemn protest. For their sakes we call upon workers of humanity everywhere, if they can do nothing for us, in mercy's name not to raise their voices against us.</p><closer xml:id="era1_130749"><signed><name>FLORIDA RUFFIN RIDLEY,</name><title>Cor.

Mother says that any one would know it if they met you in the Feejee Islands."</p><p xml:id="era1_130757">Mrs. Brougham blushed, stammered and Charlie felt ashamed, while Miss Myrtle said, "Charlie, I don't think your mamma made that remark "Feejee Islands," it sounds very much like one of your own." Well, she said something of the sort," replied Charlie.</p><p xml:id="era1_130758">Mrs. Brougham began to talk to Miss Myrtle about a fair in which Miss Myrtle was interested and promised to help both with time and money.</p><p xml:id="era1_130759">I am very glad to restore your handkerchief. The monogram is very prettily done," said Miss. Myrtle as Mrs. Brougham departed.</p><p xml:id="era1_130760">As Mr. Brougham came slowly home at night conscience was busy at work. "What could have been the matter with Maria to-day? She is not generally unreasonable, and besides, I myself was not altogether blameless; how quickly I lost my temper." Thus he soliloquized. "I will go home instead of off to the club and see what she has got to say."</p><p xml:id="era1_130761">The front part of the house was all dark, and instantly a thought struck him. Suppose she had taken him at his word and returned home. Determined to know the worst, Mr. Brougham opened the door and entered the dining room. Supper was ready and Mrs. Brougham was making tea. As soon as he entered she said, "We are all liable to be mistaken. Let us forget and forgive, as the children say."</p><p xml:id="era1_130762">"With all my heart," replied her husband.</p><p xml:id="era1_130763">After tea she told her husband how matters stood.

The arms, the legs, the neck, the trunk must be proportionately developed. The ability to lift heavy weights, or run fast, or jump high, or perform feats of strength in one direction, if acquired by developing only one set of muscles, is a dangerous power, It is obtained at the expense of other muscles, and is a one-sided development that destroys all harmony and symmetry.</p><p xml:id="era1_130770">The power to lift, run, or kick or jump well does not always carry with it health. Strong arms are often found with weak muscles of back and abdomen, and all the conditions for spinal, heart and lung diseases. It therefore follows that any exercise which gives a one-sided development, which weakens one set of muscles to build up another set, which pays attention to one part of the body, and neglects all other parts, is to be avoided. While the system which finds the weak spots and strengthens them, which stops the development of one set of muscles at the expense of another set, and builds up all in proportion, which does not neglect the heart, or back, or abdomen, but cares for and builds up all portions of the body so necessary to a good figure, easy, graceful carriage and a strong, healthy body is the system to be adopted.</p><p xml:id="era1_130772">Physical development is a thing of slow growth. Crooked limbs, weak arms and legs, weak back and abdomen, flabby muscles, and weak lungs and heart, cannot be straightened

and made strong and cured in a week. The exercises must be taken carefully, regularly and continuously. The rule that practice makes perfect will apply here as elsewhere. No permanent benefit is to be secured by taking the exercise for several days and then neglecting it for several days or a week. Practice must be systematic, at regular intervals, and it must be progressive.</p><p xml:id="era1_130773">Classic Greece furnishes the highest development of beauty, elegance and grace. Her orators have charmed many ages, and her philosophers have earned the intellectual leadership of the world. The Greeks were the first to learn and apply the truth that mind and hand and heart are mutually dependent; that a well rounded, healthy trained body is the greatest aid to a sound, vigorous and well-equipped mind. They began with the body and the body was trained in the open air.</p><p xml:id="era1_130774">The Germans and the Swedes have followed their lead and developed the idea. With them legitimate athletic sports, games and pastimes in the open air have been supplimented with systematic gymnastics, and the beneficial results may be seen in the national character. Dr. E.M. Hartwell, in a paper delivered at the "Physical Training Conference" in 1889, in developing this point said:</p><p xml:id="era1_130775"><q>"Gymnastics have been most popular and general among the most highly trained nations, such as the Greeks of old and the Germans of to-day. The most athletic, and, at the same time, one of the most ill-trained of modern nations, is the British. I mean simply this, that an Englishman believes, and acts upon the belief, that you come to do a thing right by doing it, and not by first learning to do it right, and then doing it, whereas, the Germans leave little or nothing to the rule of thumb, not even in bodily education. German gymnastics embrace three well-marked fields or departments; viz. popular gymnastics, school gymnastics and military gymnastics. The organization of the last two departments is maintained and controlled by the government for strictly educational purposes; while the Turnvereine, as the popular gymnastic societies are called, are voluntary associations of a social and semi-educational, but wholly popular and patriotic character. The fondness of the German people for gymnastics is as marked a national trait as is the liking of the British for athletic sports. The German system of gymnastics has, been most highly developed in Prussia, where not far from a fifth of the population is undergoing systematic physical training at the present time, under the combined agencies of the schools, the army, and the Turnvereine. In Switzerland and in Norway and Sweden, you will find school and military gymnastics, especially in Sweden, quite as fully developed as in Germany, and popular gymnastics not so much so."</q></p></div><div xml:id="era1_03.11" type="Advertisement"><head rend="center">ADVERTISE IN THE WOMAN'S ERA!</head><p xml:id="era1_130776"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we132.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 3.

However, we call attention to an able and interesting letter on the subject by Mrs. Fannie Williams of Chicago. Mrs. Williams' mind and ability are well-known in Washington and Boston, where she formerly lived, and her letter will have great weight with people of those cities as well as with those of the West, with whom she has lived of late years.</p><p xml:id="era1_130799">Mrs. Williams advises us not to be in a hurry and the advice is timely.

This is especially true of the last page, which represents flourishing businesses conducted by our young men, which are a standing refutation to the fallacious charge that the young colored men of the North are seldom engaged in any but menial occupations. Every little while some one with little knowledge of the situation, and filled with sectional feeling (which should never be encouraged) goes into spasm over the dark prospect before our young men. Our young men, as a general thing, have had the good sense not to fan the flame of sectional feeling, and have been content to let intelligent people judge for themselves. The WOMAN'S ERA does not pretend to advertise all the young men in business (it devoutly wishes that it could), but it has been so readily and cheerfully supported by the young men that it is glad of the opportunity to speak for them all.</p><p xml:id="era1_130802">The WOMAN'S ERA is a woman's paper, but it is such a true woman's paper that it is intensely interested in man and all that he does.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_03.13.03" type="Editorial"><p xml:id="era1_130803">The attention of our readers is called to the open letter to Mrs. Chant printed in our Club_News. It seems to us that it is in this direction that our women find a great field of work. America stands impotent and Europe amazed at the barbarous state of affairs in the southern states of America. The protestations of black men have in most cases fallen flat and almost unnoticed. Is it not possible it has been left to black women to bring about the moral reform so urgently needed. Let our women's clubs turn their thoughts and bend their energies towards this work. The letter to Mrs. Chant has received wide consideration, and if it did no more than to call attention to the position of the colored women of the country it would not be in vain.

By this letter it is shown that in the distribution of money, food and clothes which had been sent the sufferers, Clara Barton's agents required that all colored people should work for rations, while nothing was required from white people in exchange. Miss Gould was requested by the President to make full inquiries in the hope of getting accurate and definite replies. This was done, and in the answer received the facts were reiterated, with names, dates and places. An investigation is being made at this end among workers for the sufferers, and it has been found that the Citizens Relief Association of Boston (colored, Mrs. Hannah Smith, secretary,) has now in hand quite a large sum which they have withheld because of the report that much sent by them has not been justly distributed. From Mrs. Christiansen, the wife of one of the leading merchants of Beaufort, and who has been instrumental in raising large sums in Boston and vicinity, it was found that while contributions sent through them had been distributed freely, without asking anything in return, other agents had and do require work from colored people and not from white.</p><p xml:id="era1_130812">The Club still has the matter under consideration and also some method of aiding the suffering who are still sadly in need of help.</p><p xml:id="era1_130813">Ladies of Norfolk and Berkeley, Va., are planning a Carnival <choice><sic>modelled</sic><corr>modeled</corr></choice> after that given by the Boston Club.</p><p xml:id="era1_130814">Hampton is planning a woman's club.

Two young ladies of Philadelphia, school teachers, were reported as possible delegates. Whether or not they were present has not been ascertained.

It is strange how trite and commonplace our most extravagant phrases sound in attempt to describe these incomparable June mornings.</p><p xml:id="era1_130820">Miss E.F. Andrews in the Chautauquan for May, calls attention to the fact that throughout all fiction, aside <choice><sic>ftom</sic><corr>from</corr></choice> five ideal characters of Shakespeare, there is not a mother who is an admirable character. This, she says, is the fault of the women themselves, who were content with too low a standard, and who did not claim the culture which men looked upon as their exclusive right. Formerly women were educated with a view to marriage only, and having become married, made no further effort in the line of self-culture. It was also fashionable and a sign of good breathing to have ill-health and to be very dependent. The women of the new school, she continues, hold a different view of life, believing it the duty of the wife and mother to keep in touch with the world about her, and to represent the <choice><sic>hightest</sic><corr>highest</corr></choice> 
culture attainable. They hold that daughters should be educated more with the idea of making good wives and mothers; that they should be taught to value health; should know something of business, and be able to earn their own living, even if not obliged to do so.</p><p xml:id="era1_130821">Just at present considerable interest is manifested in the events immediately preceding the Civil War. So many of those who took part in the great struggle are passing away, or, still living, are giving to the public their reminiscences of the thrilling scenes through which they have passed. Thomas Ewing, in the Cosmopolitan for May, tells his story of the struggle for freedom in Kansas, giving sketches of the leaders on both sides, and <choice><sic>fhe</sic><corr>the</corr></choice> plans and purposes of John Brown.</p><p xml:id="era1_130822">An amusing little anecdote is told of the poet Tennyson, who, it will be remembered, gloried in his disregard for the minor conventionalities of life, quite the contrary to the exquisite courtesy and high breeding of Longfellow. 0n one occasion, at a dinner-party, he rested his feet on the table, and maintained his position in spite of the indignant protests of his friends. At length someone remarked jocularly, that he might be taken for Longfellow. Down came the feet instantly, nor did they again resume the position supposed to be characteristic of Americans.</p><p xml:id="era1_130823">It is pleasant to note that many of our old authors are still at work. It is so long since they became famous that we are apt to think of them as having ceased their labors. Oliver Wendall Holmes, although eighty-five years of age, still writes, and shows no sign of failing powers. Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, at the age of eighty-one, sits for hours at her desk daily. Edward Everett Hale, at seventy-two, does much more work than many a young man. Thomas Wentworth Higginson, at seventy-five, works hard and steadily. William Wetmore Story, at seventy-five, is in Rome, writing a series of magazine articles. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, also seventy-five, not only writes, but travels, and delivers lectures at intervals.</p><p xml:id="era1_130824">Although many years have passed since the assassination of President Lincoln, it was an event of so great importance, that it is worthy of the closest study. Of late there has been a revival of efforts to prove one of the guilty parties innocent; therefore it seemed a fitting time to Mr. T.M. Harris, a member of the military commission who tried the conspirators, to give to the public a concise history of the great event, founded upon the evidence produced in the trial. This he has done in a volume entitled "The Assassination of Lincoln, a History of the Great Conspiracy." The matter is arranged in the form of an interesting narrative, and fills a good sized and handsomely bound volume. It is published by the American Citizen Company.</p><p xml:id="era1_130825">The American Citizen Company also publishes a book by J. Robert Love, M.D., of Port Au Prince, Hayti, called "The Indictment, the Testimony, and Verdict, or Proofs, that Romanism is not Christianity."</p><p xml:id="era1_130826">Mr. W.D. Howells begins in Harper's for May, an account of his first visit to New England. He gives a sketch of his acquaintance with Bayard Taylor, whom he met on this trip, and tells of his disappointment in seeing the ocean for the first time while at Portland, which he visited on account of its being the birthplace of Longfellow. We will all he glad to know his impressions of Boston.</p><p xml:id="era1_130827">Captain King, who, in "Between the Lines," is said to have given the best description of a battle that has ever been given in the English language, has written a book called "Cadet Days," which all young men with military inclinations will find interesting. In his previous books he has shown us what soldiers are and what they can do, and he now tells us how soldiers are made. Captain King is a graduate of West Point, and although not the hero of his tale, is part of it.</p><p xml:id="era1_130828">Of the making of dictionaries there seems to be no end; and since all of the new ones are equally up to date and replete with information, there is little choice among them. Yet the "Standard," published by Funk and Wagnalls, New York, has one especial feature which recommends it to everyone. The definition is placed immediately after the word, and the eye is saved the trouble of looking through the derivations and authorities.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_03.17" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_130829"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we134.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 3.

Alcott and her works, for "Little Women, "Old Fashioned Girl," and "Little Men" are household words among girls, but possibly they do not know that "Work," "Hospital Sketches," and others are just as interesting, and add to that "Louise Alcott's Life," a record of a thoroughly unselfish, helpful one. One little incident of her kindness and thoughtfulness was never published, I think.</p><p xml:id="era1_130868">Once a woman happened to be sitting side of her in a crowded car, reading a novel. Accidentally she dropped it. and Miss Alcott returned it to her and entered into conversation with her on the merits of novel reading. The woman said she read novels for amusement, finding, as she grew older that she did not care for books that made her think. Miss Alcott rather agreed with her, but thought that books might be read that would combine both instruction and amusement. A few days later this woman's heart was made glad by a box of old magazines and books, accompanied by a note signed "Louise M. Alcott."</p><p xml:id="era1_130869">"Three Generations," by Janet Rose, is a fine story of colonial days, and Mary Mapes Dodge has written a number of stories for children. One, "Hans Brinker," is a pretty story of child life in Holland. I wonder if any of my girls read Vancy's books. They were quite popular some.Tears ago, and I think no girl could help feeling better, and that she could lead a more unselfish life and do some good to others after perusing these books. Mrs. A. D. Whitney's "Real Folks" is worth reading, so is Mrs. Burnett's "Louisiana," and scores of others I might mention.</p><p xml:id="era1_130870">Charlotte Yonge, an English writer, has written many books for young girls. "The Chaplet of Pearls" gives a quaint description of the times of the French revolution; "The Queen's Four Maries" tells of the stormy days of Scottish history; "The Pupils of St. John" is a narrative of the early Christian church; "Pigeon Pie" is a child's account of Charles I's reign.</p><p xml:id="era1_130871">William Ware's "Zenobia" would perhaps interest older readers.

W.B. Derrick, the Woman's Loyal Union of Now York and Brooklyn have as a permanent place of meeting his cheerful rooms in the Bible house, New York, free of charge. This is a decided step forward for the Union, and its members and well wishers are greatly encouraged, for like most experimental associations, the W.L.U. began its existence minus a treasury, and though they have the nucleus of one, yet the chief effort of the newly-revised constitution is in the direction of creating a treasury they began work on the principle that each member be taxed pro rata for all expenses incurred, but, experience has proven beyond a doubt the utter fallacy of such a system, for rarely does it happen that more than one-quarter of the members attend, generally, consequently a faithful few bear the burden that would be but a trifle if every member thoughtfully bore her part. It is expected that quite a nice showing will be made by the W.L.U. Relief Fund, formed during the severe stringency of the early winter. Under the guidance of Mrs. J.E. Garned and Miss S.E. Frazier a number of children have been provided with warm, neatly repaired garments; the Union also subscribed the sum of ten dollars in aid of the Chyenne sufferers in South Carolina.</p><p xml:id="era1_130877">A number of ladies are agitating the question of the employment of our girls in stores and various commercial establishments, etc., which led to the question, are young girls of the race at this present time truly anxious and ambitious for such a crusade?--If anxious, are they ready?--in their accomplishments do they consider Commercial requirements? Those and many questions of like nature deluge the mind when the subject is broached. There is a determination among the members of the W. L. U. to push this matter, providing, of course, the young women give the needed impetus. Without reliable material the most zealous efforts will fail, because no business man will employ a girl just because she is colored, and ought to have a chance. She must be able to fill the position desired. Among other needed reforms, there is one connected with the colored home which has been brought before the W. L. U. and steps taken preliminary to action in the matter.</p><p xml:id="era1_130878">The women here like the WOMAN'S ERA, and when 'tis generally circulated will become a decided favorite. The very fact that 'tis a woman's paper all the way through will after a little time form a striking plea for the sympathy of thoughtful women.

When this was worn thread-bare, it was followed by "This is a white man's government, and the white man will rule it, right or wrong." Election after election was carried with this slogan. The ballot box was a sham and a delusion. One by one the Negro saw the promises of the government to protect him and secure to him his rights as a citizen broken. He has appealed without avail for the right to live. His record as a gallant soldier in defence of the Union, his record as a law-abiding citizen have counted for naught. He was enslaved for more than two hundred years and robbed of his labor, beaten and bruised, his wife and children sold away from him, his women robbed of virtue and honor by the enslavers, and now that the English press, aroused by a Negro woman fleeing from the hand of the lyncher, dares speak out and denounce murder and the murderers, these lynchers, who have never spared the honor and virtue of Negro women, whose hands are dripping with Blood of their own illegitimate children, confident of protection from American public opinion, feel it necessary to offer a new excuse for their crimes when called to book by public opinion abroad. Up to their ears in guilt against Negro women, they offer as their excuse for murdering Negro men, Negro women and Negro children, that white women are not safe from the Negro rapist. And for these murderers, lynchers and burners, for these latter-day saints, who preyed for two and a half centuries on their helpless slave women, we are told that Francis Willard of America. and Laura Ormiston Chant of England, have entered the list as apologists. These two fearless defenders of the right would let no liquor dealer escape, but would apologize for the white criminal, if the victim be Negro man, woman or child. The man, white or black, who assaults women, should be apprehended and punished by imprisonment or death, if such be the decree of the law. For such men no excuse is to be made. But it is the duty of the law, and not of the mob to inflict this punishment. And every man, of whatever crime charged, has the right of a fair trial in the courts. All that is asked is that the law reign, and not the mob.</p><p xml:id="era1_130887">In ten years 800 Negroes have been murdered by mobs at the South. Of these 800 only 269, about one-third have even been charged with the crime of outrage. Investigation has proven many of these 269 groundless charges, and in those with some show of truth, the women have been proven to be as bad as the Negro men, and that they made the charges only after being detected in living improperly with the men. If this charge is true, if Negro men are given to assaults upon white women, why do not they attempt the crime in the North where the courts would give them a fair trial? Why do they confine the attempt to the South, where the mere charge is sure death, and no opportunity is given for a trial? Why did not the slaves, when their masters were away trying to shoot the Union to death and keep them forever slaves, outrage the wives and daughters of these traitors confided to their care?</p><p xml:id="era1_130888">No! the charge is not true. It is no justification. It is an infamous crime against the only law-abiding people at the South. The lynchers are Murderers. Their apologists must share their condemnation, and if by influencing public opinion against stopping lynching, they must share the odium of abbettors of murder.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_03.23" type="Announcement"><head rend="center">HON FREDERICK DOUGLASS IN BOSTON.</head><p xml:id="era1_130889">The announcement of the coming to Boston of Frederick Douglass was the signal that called together once more about all that remains of the old anti-slavery party. From all parts of New England they came to his lecture at the People's Church on May 10, to have their old-time enthusiasm aroused by his still fiery eloquence in the cause of humanity. And when at the close he turned and took each old friend and co-worker by the hand, and tremulously told of their fidelity to principle when it cost something to advocate the cause of the oppressed, it was grandly pathetic and seemed like a benediction. On the afternoon of thu day preceding the lecture, a reception was tendered Mr. Douglass, by the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association, and the "remnant" was all there. Mrs. Mary A. Livermore stood to receive with Mr. Douglass a lively throng of Boston's best in literature, art and philanthropy. Among them there were the venerable Dr. Bartol and his artist daughter, Col. Higginson, the Garrison brothers, the Allen families of West Newton and Cambridge, Lieut. and Mrs. Charles L. Mitchell, Hon. Henry C. and Miss Blackwell. Miss Maria S. Porter, Mr. Charles Lenox, and a host of others. On the morning of his last day in Boston Mr. Douglass, on invitation of Representative Teamoh, visited the Mass. State Legislature; both branches of that body adjourned while he was introduced to and addressed the members. Several attempts to entertain the distinguished guest by private parties were frustrated by his early departure from the city.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_130890" n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_03.24" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_130891"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we135.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 3.

Lewis</docAuthor><p xml:id="era1_130953">Mrs. R.E. Moore, President of Woman's Club, Chicago, was born in Missouri. At an early age she was brought by relatives to Chicago. Having finished the prescribed course of the grammar schools of this city, the same old story was whispered into willing ears and she became Mrs. Richard E. Moore. When a school-girl she was noted for her quiet unassuming manners and sympathetic nature which, as she grew older, became more marked, and has preeminently fitted her for the various positions she has been called upon to occupy. Her husband being one of the most prominent "Masons" in the country, she has taken an active part in the O. E. S.; its high intellectual and moral teachings finding in her a staunch supporter. When Mrs. Frances E. Harper was in Chicago during the "Worlds Fair," seeing the wide field for work, at her suggestion a meeting of the representative women of the city was called to consider the possibilities of concerted action for influence in elevating and assisting in Race-Work throughout the country, which call was met with universal approval, out of which was evolved the "Woman's Club of Chicago," with Mrs. John Jones, Pres., Miss Ida B. Wells, Vice-Pres. Upon Mrs. Jones resigning Miss Wells still continued the meetings, acting as President. Miss Wells being called upon to fill an engagement in England whereupon Mrs. Moore was unanimously Chosen to be acting President until the return of Miss Wells. When Mrs. Moore assumed the Office of President, the "Club" had only a preamble, setting forth a general statement of the purposes of the Club but no rules for government, and as the Club had passed into permanent organization, Mrs. Moore immediately began setting about getting the workings of the Club into a systematic condition; the result was a Constitution and By-laws, also a petition to the State to be incorporated which was granted; the Constitution and by-laws although brief are Concise in their character. On the return of Miss Wells from England Mrs. Moore will resign the Presidency of the Club, but will still continue to assist in any capacity which will be most beneficial. By her sympathies for the oppressed, pride of race, and zeal in work for all that is elevating she has won the lasting admiration of The Woman's Club of Chicago.</p><byline>FRANCES A.

May 21, 1894.</head><docAuthor>Mrs. S.H. Johnson</docAuthor><p xml:id="era1_130954">This interesting little city is nearly half way between Topeka and the two Kansas Cities, having all the advantages of a suburban town, and has gained for itself the title "Athens of the West." To be in Lawrence at once means to be in the midst of comforts, pleasure and intelligence. We may truly say that what Boston is to the East, Lawrence is to the West. Being the scene of much bloodshed during the early days of Kansas, the history of Lawrence is really the history of Kansas. It is the seat of the Kansas State University and has it splendid School system, with a high school that prepares pupils for the University. We have very fine churches, --visitors have jocularly remarked that every other house was either a Church or Schoolhouse. While that is not quite true, we can boast of more schools and Churches than is customary for a place so small.</p><p xml:id="era1_130956">From this fact, one Can see that Club life would be one of the prominent features of social life in this city. For a long time the "Progressive Club", composed of graduates from High School and University students, was the only club. It meets the first Thursday in every month and is entirely literary in its work; at its meetings light refreshments are served and during this time many of the problems of the time are discussed. Its members are chiefly young people, married and single, male and female. Next follows the "Eureka"--the fortnightly club. It is a social Club; it aims to give its
<pb xml:id="era1_130955" n="2 THE WOMANS ERA."/>
member's recreation--an impromptu programme being rendered every other meeting. This club is for married people. "A. V. C." is our young ladies' club; and "Sierra Leone" for mothers. These are the outgrowth of the "Progressive." In all of these clubs women play a conspicuous part. The "Eureka" Club serves refreshments once a month--the last Monday night. After reading the article written on "Social Etiquette" in your Women at Home Department, it might be interesting to other women to know that we members of the "Sierra Leone" felt the need of a social reform in the matter of calls and could see the utter impracticability of persons "dropping in" at any time; we have set aside Thursday afternoon of each week as our receiving day. Each lady then expects calls and is prepared to receive them. Many are the little afternoon teas and luncheons and picnics and dainty breakfasts given in our town--all of which help to make Lawrence a pleasant place to visit.</p><p xml:id="era1_130957">During Commencement Week all the clubs contribute and have a grand banquet for our High School graduates and visitors.</p><p xml:id="era1_130958">I have tried to make our sisters acquainted with our <hi rend="italic">social</hi> life and will say that Mrs. W.

the club, using the Women's Era carnival as it model, carried out the project with enthusiasm and energy.

The speeches were all good and very instructive.</p><p xml:id="era1_130976">Thursday, 24 ; Anniversary day. Inspection of boys in ranks, 8.30 A.

All of the Industrial Exhibits, showing products of farm and shop were in the Stone Memorial Building. Luncheon was over at 1 o'clock.</p><p xml:id="era1_130977">1.30 P.

An excellent speech was delivered M. Mead of Boston, editor of the New England Magazine. The plantation songs were sung with the usual enthusiasm by the students. The president of the board of trustees, Mr. Ogden made appropriate address to the graduating class and awarded the diplomas.

A conference of graduates and others was held both morning and afternoon to discuss methods by which graduates of Hampton can best promote the welfare of their race. This is a new feature added to the Anniversary Week, and it is hoped that some good will be gleaned from it. The discussion of the forenoon was that of land-buying and farming, and what the percent was of negro landowners, compared with his white brother. It was discussed very intelligently.</p><p xml:id="era1_130982">Saturday evening, May 26.

It is especially needed because Mrs. Chant has chosen to ignore me and the movement ever since she has been proven wrong. I called twice at her house here in London to convince her of the great need of her help, but she was out, and her daughter couldn't tell when at any time she would be in. Then I left my card and address asking that she would send me word when I could see her. That was more than three weeks ago. She has utterly ignored the whole matter.

The circular is an intelligent step in the right direction' the Loyal Union evidently intends gaining a clear understanding of the situation, and without doubt that is the way to undertake any broad work.</p><p xml:id="era1_130998">At, the meeting of the Massachusetts State Federation of Clubs held at Marlboro, Mass., June 7, the Woman's Era Club was admitted to membership.</p><p xml:id="era1_130999">The warm weather makes active club work out of the question; most large clubs will take a vacation. The prospects for a profitable winters work for our clubs are great. Everywhere our women are feeling fresh inspiration for organized work, not only is this true of the clubs already formed, but many new organizations are being formed.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301000">Many letters of inquiry have been received inquiring into the methods of forming leagues. The published reports upon the leagues are the best answers that can be given.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301001">A committee composed of the Secretaries of the Woman's Era Club together with Miss Eliza Gardner, Mrs. Agnes Adams and Messrs. Wilson, Morgan and Morris met at Miss Eliza Gardner's, 20 N. Anderson Street, on Monday evening, June 18, to devise ways and means with which to arouse public sentiment in regards to the lynching of the colored people. The men and women of Boston have long deplored the condition of things in the south and elsewhere, and feel that something ought to be done at the very earliest opportunity. After much discussion the committee organized with Mr. Butler R. Wilson as Chairman and Mrs. Hannah Smith as Secretary. The Chairman then laid out a very effective plan of the work to be done which was accepted by the committee, which committee was augmented by the addition of the names, Mrs. Ariana Sparrow, Mrs. Mary Howard. The Chairman then appointed the sub-committees which resulted in the following:--</p><p xml:id="era1_1301002">Committee on Resolutions</p><p xml:id="era1_1301003">Mr. Clement Morgan, Mr. Emory Morris, Miss Eliza Gardner.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301004">Committee to communicate with the Clergy--Mrs. U.A.

Closing meetings with social attachments have followed each other in quick succession, and kept the average society woman on the hop skip and jump to keep up with the procession of hall banquets, literary high teas, charity receptions and garden parties with feasting, music and dancing, and of course yearly reports and literary papers thrown in to hold down the balance and keep the New England women from becoming too frivolous, and so casting reproach upon her severe and sober ancestry. This year the <hi rend="italic">woman suffragists</hi> led with their annual reunion and banquet in Music Hall; six hundred men and women sat at the supper tables and afterwards listened to some of the best and brightest speeches and music ever given at this always bright festival; and through it all the spirit of the pioneer, Lucy Stone, pervaded and incited the large gathering to greater enthushism than ever for the cause she loved.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_04.06.02" type="Report"><head rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Moral Education Association.</hi></head><p xml:id="era1_1301013">Then followed the feast of reason only of the M. E. A. This annual is always held in the morning and lives in the memory as fragrant of spring blooms--brought by the members--and cultured and helpful words said by the speakers. The opening address this year by the president, Mrs. Abba Goold Woolson, was a literary high feast, and proved that the most delicate subjects may be so skilfully handled as to be both pleasureable and profitable to listen to. The objects of this society are to endeavor to educate the moral sense of the community; to disseminate a knowledge of the laws that should govern human life in all its relations; and, when occasion demands, to ask of legislative and executive bodies the enactment of such statutes as are needful and the enforcement of such as exist, for the prevention of social vice, and the promotion of social purity.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_04.06.03" type="Report"><head rend="center"><hi rend="bold">N.E.

Ohannes Chatschumian of the University of Leipsic, Rev.

The great idea is that of unity--the lack of which is so marked among us. We know so little of one another, a convention would be a broad avenue by which we could learn more. We would be enabled to exchange thoughts, sympathy, gain helps and hints, learn where our work is most needed, in short, such a meeting would benefit us a thousand-fold.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301023">Where there is union, success is insured. It is the basis of society and has ever been. Organization is not advocated enough; it should be our watchword. Women's clubs, whose purpose is to better the condition of the race morally, intellectually and socially, should be established in every state in the Union. You have but to introduce the work and the inspiration is caught at once. Here in our city there are many noble workers ready to enter the field at once, when a fortnight ago they were ignorant of the fact that such a field lay before them. I admire the purpose of these clubs, protection for our women is so much needed, especially for the yournger ones everywhere, but particularly in the south. There are hundreds of germs that might develop into virtuous and noble womanhood that are crushed and buried in ignorance and degradation for the want of a little encouragement, a kind word, one ray of hope. Here in the southland hopes have so long proved vain that the natural result is despair. Here in the southland, in the midst of dire oppression, is a large field for labor, and I appeal to the several clubs already formed to lose no time in spreading this work throughout the south. In case you know no one you might introduce it among the female students of some college. You have but to manifest a heartfelt interest to succeed and there is no better way than to call a woman's national convention.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301024">This convention movement is the greatest in the history of the race. In the history of all nations women have played a prominent part, and the time has arrived for the daughters of Ethiopia to fall into line.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301025">One of the main objects of the convention should be to create sentiment against mob violence, and to recommend bills before the legislatures of the several states where it is indulged in. Such bills as Hon. H.C. Smith introduced before the Ohio legislature. Especial attention should be given to minor evils that tend in any way to retard the progress of the race. I suggest that the convention be held at Boston. It is the most appropriate place in my judgment, and aside from its excellent accommodations there are many places of historic note that would afford entertainment no other city could furnish, and although Boston is by no means the central city there is but little difference in the rates, as a passenger getting a season ticket south can go to Boston at nearly the same rates as to Chicago. I hope that such a movement will not be thwarted, but that the month of August, 1894, will ever stand out in history as one of the grandest and noblest in the last quarter of a century, and the promoters of the convention movement should never be forgotten.</p><salute>Yours for the convention,</salute><signed><name>JOSEPHINE E.

He is a party to the murder of negroes in his state because he makes no attempt to punish the murderers. These figures support the claim of Miss Wells that no excuse exists for murder by lynching, and they condemn the south where this murder is done and demonstrate the falsity of the charge against the negroes of the south, and convict their slanderers of a crime against a race almost as wicked and horrible as their slanderous charge.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_04.10.03" type="Editorial"><head rend="center"><hi rend="bold">A Safe Voyage and Quick Return.</hi></head><p xml:id="era1_1301052">The hearty good wishes of the people of West End of Boston will attend the Rev.

Several years ago he came to Boston but slightly known, at a time when a crisis hung over the field to which he came and when he was indifferently received. Today he is welcomed in every work of charity. No movement in the interest of the poor goes without his earnest and active support. The rum shop recognizes in him a never tiring, intelligent and forceful opponent. His plan is to make people better by making them more intelligent and by giving them healthy  occupation, innocent amusement, and by opening to them all means of education. and the people have been quick to recognize his services in securing from landlords leaner, warmer and healthier tenements for the poor. They have appreciated his efforts to secure in congested districts of the city branches of the public library. At the West and North Ends of the city he is know as the friend of the children, the poor and the sick, and they will miss him most.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301053">His public spirit, fearless advocacy of the right and his ability to unite all classes of men in his work made him a great and successful power.

LENOX--NANCY PRINCE.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301116">BY AN OLD BOSTONIAN,</p><p xml:id="era1_1301117">The death of Mrs. L. L. Lenox, wife of Mr. John M. Lenox, removes another branch of one of the oldest colored families in New England. Her grandfather, Prince Ames, was a soldier in the 27th regiment of Penn., Washington's army, and served from Bunker Hill to the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown, and on one occasion was personally commended by Washington himself, who was trying the faithfulness of the guard for true soldierly conduct. His widow, whom many now living will remember, drew a pension till her death, which took place at Jamaica Plain in 1864, at the advanced age of ninety-seven. Mrs. Lenox's father, John T. Hilton, was born in Pennsylvania, but came to Boston at the age of seventeen, and until his death, in 1864, was one of the most prominent colored men in the country. In the early days of the antislavery movement he was called Mr. Garrison's right hand man by the colored people, and was afterwards, 1854, vice-president of the antislavery society. Her mother, who died in Cambridge, November 2, 1882, was a member of the female antislavery society; both being members of the African Baptist Church, Belknap (now Joy) St., where she (Mrs. Lenox) was at one time a member of the choir. Mrs. Lenox obtained her education partly at the Exclusive School on Belknap St. and at the Alumni Grammar School in Cambridge, and was esteemed by the committee as one of the two best readers in the Cambridge schools at that time. After her graduation she obtained a situation in a daguerrotype case-making establishment in Boston, where she was employed for several years. She was always one of the most active in every measure in which she was connected for the improvement of her people condition. Whe was among the young ladies that was always ready to co-operate with the Young Men's Literary society on occasions when their assistance was solicited, as it often was. (For this society not only did much to foster mental culture and improvement among the colored people of Boston and vicinity, but was also practical in many ways). She was also often seen going around carrying a number of bills given her by her father to be placed in special places, having the heading, so familiar to our people in those days, " To the Rescue! ------- Fugitives, about to be arrested," sent forth by order of the vigilant committee when some brave fellows, who had succeeded in making their escape from slavery, seemed in danger of apprehension and arrest. Many, now living, will remember her presiding at the tables of the antislavery fairs, and how much her cheerful ways contributed to enliven those occasions. She also was a member of the "Fourier Club", a society consisting of both white and colored persons, find was very influential in alleviating the conditions of the colored people.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301118">Mrs. Lenox, after her marriage, was for many years a resident of Waltham, Mass, where she was always characterized by her devotion to her down-trodden people, and never ceased to speak or act in their behalf, when opportunity presented itself. It was through her personal influence and recommendation that that author and philanthropist, Nancy Prince, was introduced and became popular with the people of that town and the places adjacent; and the lectures she delivered from time to time in the former place may still be remembered by some of the older residents. Many an one in the old days gave testimony to the light they received from that entertaining speaker by her <choice><sic>rehersal</sic><corr>rehearsal</corr></choice> of her experience and labors in Russia and West India, for Mrs. Lenox was among the first of the many colored workers to embark for the W. I. after emancipation, where her labors with others that went from the U. S. were of great service, and her co-operation in antislavery work and in special works of philanthropy. It may not be known to many that Mrs. Prince was the founder of the first orphan asylum for colored children in New England and was its firs matron. Her book, "Life of Nancy Prince," published in 1849, may still be found in the houses of many of the old residents of Boston, as well as other places all over Massachusetts.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301119">Mrs. Lenox was highly esteemed in Waltham, where she and her husband did much to dispel prejudice in that place, and to increase the antislavery sentiment there existing. She was also noted for her charitable disposition and her many acts in this direction will be remembered by not a few. Mrs. Lenox never forgot the lessons of Christianity, which were early inculcated in her by noble, high- minded parents.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_1301120" n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_04.13" type="Article"><head rend="center">HEALTH AND BEAUTY FROM EXERCISE.</head><docAuthor>Mary P. Evans</docAuthor><byline>MARY P. EVANS.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301121">Paper No.3,</p><p xml:id="era1_1301122">The German system of gymnastics, almost a century old and built up by men of great culture and experience,--physicians, physiologists, and pedagogues--embraces exercises with apparatus, calisthenics, outdoor sports, such a jumping, running, leaping, throwing the weight, wards, dumb bells and clubs and military gymnastics. In this system specialism is discouraged. the aim is general physical culture. Another feature is class work, which produces endless pleasure and refreshment of mind, and to secure this result the instruction begins with the simple and works up to the more complicated movements.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301123">The Swedish or Ling system of gymnastics is founded upon the laws of nature and the human organism, and the exercises are selected only when proved to be needed by the body. It aims to correct faulty growth and bad posture. This system starts with the functions of the heart and lungs, as the fundamental functions, with the welfare of all the other functions dependent upon them. Starting with the heart and lungs right, the progress is steady and systematic.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301124">Perhaps the best system to be pursued is a combination of the Ling and German systems under careful supervision of experienced instructors. In these two systems and the outdoor games and exercises in the reach of most of us may be found the means of bringing the body into harmony with the will, of attaining the grace of body, the growth of muscle,--the proportion so often lost sight of--the health of body and brain, and the dexterity of limbs and control of nerves of such inestimable value.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301125">Faithful, earnest and painstaking physical exercise, such as has been indicated under intelligent direction, rewards the girl who keeps it up with health, youth and beauty. It keeps the body in the best condition for throwing off disease. It enables you to keep in the best condition for work with the hands or with the brain. It is a wholesome and powerful preventive of morbid, sickly and injurious brooding and thinking. It helps you to see things, to know people, and to judge them in a broad instead of a narrow spirit. It prepares you to meet disappointment, sorrow, ill treatment and great suffering as the strong, courageous and splendid woman meets them. It is a great aid to clear, quick and right thinking.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301126">Physical beauty, strength, health and youth are priceless treasures, but they cannot take the place of mind and heart. The physically perfect woman is not full grown unless heart and mind have been also developed, trained and refined. Indeed, one aids the other, and neither can be fully developed without the other. "An open heart, and an <choice><sic>honsst</sic><corr>honest</corr></choice> mind are as essential to youth and health as breathing is." The face, the eyes, the mouth reflect the sentiments, the thought of heart and mind. The mind and heart that feed on diseased ideas, that live in impurity instead of in the fresh, inspiring, healthy atmosphere of right living and right acting, will take from the face all refinement, all beauty, and mark it with hard lines.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_04.14" type="Review"><head rend="center">LITERARY DEPARTMENT.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301127">England is enjoying a monopoly on the novelists of the hour and is taking great pride in furnishing America with its fiction, as most of the books that have attracted universal attention in this country lately have been written by English authors.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301128">No one is more fit to head the list of the popular English writers of the present day than is Thomas N. Hardy, who has been enjoying a reputation for years and has received the enthusiastic support of the best of the literary people of England. Of his books "Tess" in which lie depicts the recuperative power of a fallen woman, has been most widely discussed. He says that he takes his characters from the lower classes because he finds in them more sentiment and romance.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301129">Walter Besant also depicts the lower classes.-- His characters in "All Sorts and Conditions of Men" are from studies carefully made by him while wandering through the slums of London. This book was written for a purpose and, strange to say, accomplished it. In it he showed that in all London there was not a place where a respectable poor man could go for recreation; and from the discussion which it caused, Queen Victoria opened the People's Palace, a great, hall where the poorest may find the best and purest amusement.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301130">An adventurer who was able to turn his adventures into literature, and his literature into fame and money is H.

He is now living quietly in a beautiful home with his wife and children and is the lion of all London.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301132">Rudyard Kipling, who is now making his home in Vermont, is said to have brought India nearer to England than did the Suez Canal.

He has written nothing of New England worthy of his genius, but he says that he has a hundred stories of India unwritten.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301133">Another adventurer who can send his imagination back into history and forward into the unknown, and who call chill the blood of and send horror to the heart of his readers is Robert Louis Stevenson.

His first success "Micah Clark," and his latest "The Refugees;" but the most popular of all his books are those on "The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes." These are wonderfully clever detective stories, and the original of "Sherlock Holmes" is a doctor in Edinburgh, a former instructor of Dr. Doyle. So clamorous had the public become for more of the adventures, that the author was <choice><sic>oblige</sic><corr>obliged</corr></choice> to kill his hero, and <choice><sic>profitting</sic><corr>profiting</corr></choice> by the example of Bret Harte and Rider Haggard, refuses to resuscitate him.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301137">Jas.

"A Little Minister" and "A Window in Thrums" are his most popular books.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301138">The most widely read and widely discussed novel upon religion is "Robert Elsmere" by Mrs. Humphrey Ward, on whom it is conceded that George Eliot's mantle has fallen. Her next book was "The History of David Grieve," which was read and discussed still more widely. Her latest novel is "Marcella", which is published in two volumes in this country, and in England three. It is selling well, but is not being talked about to any great extent.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301139">Madame Sarah Grand, the author of "The Heavenly Twins" was born in Ireland of English parentage. She was married at sixteen and became the step-mother of two boys. She is said to be a very womanly woman, although she holds her opinions with a man-like firmness. She believes in absolute equality between husband and wife, and believes in the emancipation of woman from shallowness and ignorance, but not from domesticity. "The Heavenly Twins" is better liked in America than in England, though it is widely read in both countries.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301140">William E. Norris, the author of "Matrimony," "No New Thing" and other well-known novels writes a sort of story that introduces his readers to good company. He lives in a beautiful country home supplied with everything that makes life delightful, and spends three hours of each day writing.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301141">William Black is an author who excels in the description of natural scenery, but whose stories have nearly all a tragic ending, and leave an impression of sadness on the mind.

The nurse herself should be neat to a fault; she should have her hair neatly combed, clean calico or plain blue gingham dresses with deep wide cuffs and large aprons. Caps are not worn by all, but a nurse who has served her time and received her diploma fully realizes that to wear her uniform is an honor and is the proper garb for a nurse on duty, and belongs only to the trained nurse.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301146">The teeth should be kept in good order, the nails well trimmed and sensible soft shoes worn to prevent noise when moving around the sick room.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301148">The first thing to be noticed
<pb xml:id="era1_1301147" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
about a sick room is the air. Some people are afraid of air, but if more people ventilated the rooms properly there would be less <hi rend="italic">tuberculosis</hi> in the world and especially among our own race. The more fresh air the better. The temperature of a sick room ought to be 70 degrees Fahrenheit, and it is well, if possible, to put the patient into the most pleasant room in the house where plenty of sunlight may come in. Watch the temperature, do not let it get chilly, never allow a patient, (no matter how warm it may be) to lie without a blanket over him. Oftentimes it is very hard to make them understand that this is necessary, but a chill would be liable to terminate fatally when one has a fever.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301149">In order to ventilate carefully it is well to open the windows from top and bottom, the air which comes into the room from the lower part of the window is better, it circulates better through the rooms; and often it is found necessary to put a screen in front of the window. Avoid draughts.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301150">Next to be considered is the condition of the patient's bed, notice carefully that all sheets are smooth and carefully tucked into the bottom of the bed, the pillows smooth, and comfortably placed under the head. Notice the wearing apparel, see that every article is smooth, nothing is more disagreeable than wrinkles to lie on. In my experience I find that different people are to be treated differently; some patients like one thing, others another, and it is wise to try to please the patient if possible, provided it will not conflict with the doctors orders. Always carry out the physicians orders to the letter, never try to question an order, give the medicine exactly when ordered, let the patient be your first thought. Nothing is more essential to the recovery of a patient, than cleanliness and careful bathing. The patient perspires very freely and has to be bathed very often. Bathe every day if possible, and if convenient change the top sheet every morning. The best time to give a bath is at 10 A. M., between breakfast and dinner. Frequent bathing keeps the pores of the skin open and  a great deal of waste matter is carried off by the skin.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301151">For the benefit, of those who do not know how to give a sponge bath I will tell you in this paper.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301152">Have plenty of towels and soap, two pitchers of water, one hot and the other cold, a large wash bowl and foot tub. Have the water about 98 degrees Fahrenheit, two wash cloths and a slop jar. Two extra blankets, brush and comb, tooth brush, etc. Place everything by the side of the bed and think before beginning to undress your patient so as to have nothing to leave the room for during the bath. Place the patient between two blankets, then remove the clothing and bathe carefully only one portion of the body at a time. Change water often and bathe only one side at a time then gently turn the patient and bathe the other side. Wash the feet the last thing. Put on the night dress very carefully by putting one arm in first, then the head and other arm. Next, comes the patient's hair, one side at a time, and lastly change the bed linen. Take the clean sheet lengthwise, fold it in very small folds or roll it towards the middle, placed the rolled part against the patient's back, smooth out the part not folded then gently turn your patient towards the smooth part of the bed and draw the rolled sheet over to the back part, tuck in both sides. Thus you put on the under sheet, a draw sheet is folded in the middle by the two hems and put on in the same manner under the back and hips. The top sheet is put on in an entire different manner. Lift the clothes up at the foot, take the clean top sheet which has previously been rolled halfway from the top hem and place the smooth part over the patient's feet, tuck in at the bottom with the rest of the bed clothing and draw the rolled part up, smooth carefully and your patient is sweet and clean. It takes from one hour to an hour and a half to do this carefully, but the comfort of the patient is assured when the bath is over. Alcohol may be rubbed on the patient, but it is not absolutely necessary. Some light nourishment may be given immediately after the bath, a glass of milk or cup of beef tea to prevent exhaustion.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_04.16" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_1301153"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we141.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 4.

There may be a degree of truth in all this depressing estimate of his worth, yet we need not seek far to find refutations more or less complete. There are so many things that contradict and make ridiculous the old stereotyped conclusion concerning the Negro's mental and moral worth that it is not worth while to argue against them. It is much more agreeable and reassuring to make note of some of the evidences that there is a soulfulness and power of captivation every where amongst us that now and then. surprise and confound our enemies.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301222">We have recently been again reminded that we owe much to the people of England for their gracious recognition of the manhood and womanhood of the American Negro.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301223">Twenty years ago when the American people were still unaccustomed to regard-their colored fellow citizens as others than serfs, with no status of respectability in America the British people heard with rapturous delight the sweet singing students from Fish University. These unaffected students so won the hearts of all Britain that chivalry could scarcely go further than in the spontaneous attentions and compliments paid to them. The charm of Negro minstrelsy was not more pleasing to the sturdy Englishmen than the unexpected refinement of these women. Our character as women worthy of womanly recognition was then firmly established in England.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301224">The extraordinary interest aroused throughout England by Miss Ida B. Wells' thrilling recitals of American savagery is the further evidence of how British chivalry still regards the colored American woman. If the present manifestation of British sentiment in our behalf is higher pitched and more definite in its influence on American public opinion, it is because Miss Wells represents more intellectuality and a purpose that lifts her into the ranks of reformers. The unstinted social attentions paid to Miss Wells is a pleasing proof that British people are great hearted enough to pay just tribute both publicly and socially to those of our women who deserve it. What Miss Wells has accomplished in England strongly suggests the importance of a greater sense of conscious dignity and self respect among colored women.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301225">If the compliment paid to our womanhood in England means anything, it means that worthy women of the colored race will find more appreciation than they have dreamed of, if when they deserve such recognition they will but expect and demand it. It cannot be denied that our own prejudices are largely responsible for many of the disadvantages that are charged to the prejudice of the other race. There is a largeness and warmth of heart here in America that have not yet been discovered to us. These pleasant surprises that are constantly coming to us both at home and abroad, as an offset to race <choice><sic>resistence</sic><corr>resistance</corr></choice> which seems every where to confront us, should inspire us with renewed courage and conviction that there is a sense of justice, a philosophic calm of thoughtfulness all about us, that we can convert to our own use and uplifting, if we will but seek it heroically and in good temper.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_1301226" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_05.03" type="Article"><head rend="center">ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN. </head><docAuthor>Ednah D. Cheney</docAuthor><byline>EDNAH D. CHENEY.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301227">This admirable Association has now nearly reached its twenty-second year of work, and it would be difficult to estimate the influence it has exerted, and the amount of good it has done.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301228">Its object has been exactly what its name expresses; viz. to help women forward in every line of progress moral, intellectual, political, social, and industrial. Its plan of work has been, to hold a congress of women at some central city in the autumn of each year, at which may be discussed any subject affecting women's welfare.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301229">Such meetings have been held at such distant points as St. Paul Minnesota, Memphis Tennessee, Louisville Kentucky, Denver Colorado, as well as in Chicago, Buffalo, Baltimore, Philadelphia and other Eastern cities.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301230">In every city visited, but most notably in the Western and Southern cities, the Congress has left the traces of its presence, and many an important institutions such as the Women's Exchange, and the Woman's Club may be traced to its influence. Everything we have we can trace to the Congress has been said in more than one city, and the Association has often been urged to repeat its visit.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301231">The fee for membership is only two dollars a year, and besides the privileges of attending the Congress and taking part in its private discussions, the members even if not present at the meeting receive the printed reports of all that is done there.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301232">A.A.W. does not exclusively advocate any one reform, but is anxious to present with perfect fairness all sides of important questions. The Woman Sufferage question has not of course been neglected, and among its members may be found ardent advocates for it, and remonstrants against it. They frequently therefore hold a symposium in which all aspects of the case tire presented., often bringing out a lively discussion. It is interesting to see how wide-spread is the interest in this movement. In a city where is was supposed that other topics would be more desirable, the directors found to their surprise that so much disappointment was felt when it was found that this was not included in the programme, that they were obliged to arrange for an extemporaneous symposium which proved to be one of the most brilliant features of the session.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301233">The morning meetings which are confined to members only, are very interesting, as the Vice-Presidents report from each state, and bring out many important facts and much interesting discussion.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301234">As it is a great object to unite all the women of the country, not in an iron-clad organization, but in cordial union of mutual interest and good feeling, the association has desired for some years to extend its work among the Southern states, where there is much new life thought among the women. Their reception at Memphis was very cordial and the meeting most successful. It was delightful to hear the noble "Hymn of the Republic" read by its author and responded to by the whole audience, in the city which had always been associated in our minds with gunboats, and shot and shell between the opposing armies in the civil war.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301235">This year it is proposed to visit Knoxville in Tennessee, and afterwards to extend the journey to Atlanta, Ga., to visit the well known University which is doing so much to provide a higher education for the people of Georgia, and also the admirable industrial school at Tuskegee, Ala.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301236">While the Association does not take up as a special work the defence of any one race or class of people, it does feel very strongly that in just and harmonious relations between all the various races and people who help make up the American nation, rests the only hope of firm and substantial well-being for all, and it is therefore earnest in its desire to promote good feeling between all sections of the country, and all classes of the people.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301237">The welfare of the colored people is not forgotten, and while trying to emphasize distinctions of color as little as possible, they feel that the women who have come out from such deep experience of suffering have important lessons to teach, and that both for them and for all, their education and advancement is of great importance.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301238">One measure which was suggested and urged at the Congress at Louisville, Ky., the training of colored women as nurses, is rapidly spreading through many states, and young women are seeking opportunity for the best training at the North, that they may be fitted to take charge of the classes which are established at Hampton and several other schools in the South. The letters in the ERA by Miss Burgess shows how well these pupils have profited by their opportunities. It would be very interesting to have reports from other schools lately established.</p><pb xml:id="era1_1301239" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era1_1301240">The great object of the Association is to awaken thought among women and lead them to a just appreciation of the duties and meaning of life wherever their lot may be cast, feeling sure that in this way they cannot fail to promote "The Advancement of Women."</p></div><div xml:id="era1_05.04" type="Article"><head rend="center">THE COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS.</head><docAuthor>Ella Lavinia Smith</docAuthor><byline>ELLA LAVINIA SMITH.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301241" rend="center">Paper No. 1.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301242">In one of Hamlin Garland's short stories "Up the Coule," he puts into the mouth of a woman the following words : "It's nothing but fret, fret and work the whole time, never going any place, never seeing anybody but a lot of neighbors just as big fools as you are. I spend my time fighting flies and washing dishes and cleaning. I'm sick of it all."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301243">The pathetic words of that poor housewife on a miserable western farm express in spirit, if not in form, the feelings of thousands of men and women all over our land.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301244">All about us are human beings struggling not alone for existence, but for <hi rend="italic">life</hi>. A life enriched and made endurable by enjoyment of some of the countless advantages offered by the civilization of these last years of the nineteenth century. How drearily futile seem their efforts, needs not the pen of Hamlin Garland nor General Booth to depict. We have only to go, with our eyes and hearts open, into the great metropolitan poor districts of our American cities, and into the southern and western farm regions to learn for ourselves "how the other half lives," and to discover that there are more things in the life immediately about us than are dreamed of in our history, economics, or even in our philosophy.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301245">And yet, though our investigation may reveal much sin, misery and suffering, we may also find that the outlook is not so dark as it may sometimes seem but that both theoretical and practical reformers are forwarding numerous general movements, political, economic, educational and religious for the purpose of bringing about greater harmony between those who ride upon and those who draw the industrial coach described by Bellamy in "Looking Backward."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301246">But though the law, public and private charities, benevolent societies and institutions, and the churches have accomplished much in their particular lines of work, yet there are avenues of life into which they have never entered, and great masses of our country and large city populations which they have never effectively reached.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301247">It is in the homes and lives of these people where tort and suffering are the common inheritance, and where there is almost total ignorance of what peace and love are that we find the objective need for the social organizations conducted for the most part by college and university bred men and women and known as College Settlements.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301248">The settlements are not missions; they are not charitable institutions; but to quote the churchman of Nov. 19, 1892, "The settlement is simply a houseful of open hearted and intelligent men or women who approach the poor, not as visitants from another world, but as dwellers in the same block or ward, as finding a pleasure (and it is a real pleasure and not a fictitious one) in the acquaintance of their fellow-inhabitants and as claiming a share in the life of that quarter of the town, and a right to contribute whatever they may have in the way of books, or music, or pictures, or general information, or meeting rooms and acquaintances to the well being of the community to which they belong. This establishes the relation of the settlement to its environment as natural instead of artificial; it leaves no room for patronage on the one side or servility on the other."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301249">The men and women residents have learned in a measure how to live the higher life themselves, and they believe in the utilization and saving power of every influence which tends to bring men and women closer to the human ideal.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301250">The lines of work along which they labor are varied, intricate and well defined. Indeed, perhaps the most striking characteristic of the settlement movement is its flexibility. All details of the development of the worker's ideas of social intercourse are left to the neighborhood to determine, and every department of work grows out of some discovery made by means of natural and reciprocal social relations.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301251">The wider knowledge and liberal training of the settlement workers enable them to take a scientific as well as philanthropic interest in the problems of life around them, and to see how factors from other forms of life may be introduced to aid in their solution and how the scope and influence of agencies that are already working toward social and economic unity may be enlarged.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301253">They work all the more effectively because they recognize in the colleges and universities themselves, and in the society of the rich, cultured and

refined a subjective need for the settlements almost as great as the objective need. They have begun to realize that if their cherished educational and social institutions are to last, they must share the higher life for which they stand, with the great masses of working people and not be satisfied until the best influence of our civilization have penetrated all the ramifications of society.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301254">The benefit to the residents themselves are not only negative, but positive, for as the Secretary of the editorial board of the American College Settlement Association expresses it, "Those who come to us expecting to give all and receive nothing soon find their mistake, for the help is mutual, and both we and our neighbors are richer for the new friendship and new outlook."</p></div><div xml:id="era1_05.05" type="Article"><head rend="center">REMINISCENCES.</head><docAuthor>Thos.

HILTON.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301255" rend="center">WOODFORK AND NANCY PRINCE.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301256">The allusion to that heroic Christian worker and philanthropist above mentioned among the reminiscences contained in your last publication calls to mind the following incident of which some now living were eye-witnesses, an account of which may be interesting to many of your readers.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301257">Most of the old residents of Boston had either seen or heard of Woodfork. In fact throughout the entire north no slaveholder's name was more familiar and no name more dreaded by those residents who had escaped from southern bondage than this inhuman cowardly kidnapper. Many a poor fugitive had been tracked by him and sent back to his so-called master. And he seemed to get along in his nefarious work unharmed.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301258">In the year 1847 Woodfork visited Boston. And his presence here was evidence that he was on the track of some one that had fled from slavery and who was known, or supposed to be, in this vicinity, which proved to be literally true, for he had not been in Boston many hours before his form was seen in that section of the city where the great body of the colored people were known to reside. Although but few recognized him it seemed to be circulated about that a slave holder was hovering around. This information, which our people in those times were so accustomed to hear, was enough to keep their eyes and ears on the alert. One day between eleven and twelve o'clock A. M., there was a ripple of excitement in the rear of Smith's Court off Belknap Street. It seemed that some children had come out of the court and reported that a slave holder was in Mrs. Dorsey's, a woman who, by some means, had succeeded in shaking off oppressions yoke and reaching Boston. This news, which was always enough to make our people drop everything and go to the rescue, was verified in this instance.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301259">It being working hours scarcely a colored man was seen in the vicinity; but, as it proved, there were those around that showed themselves equal to the occasion. Among these was Mrs. Nancy Prince (widow of Nero Prince), a colored woman of prominence in Boston who, with several others, learning that it was indeed true and that the slave holder was none other than the notorious Woodfork, hurried to the scene. Mrs. Prince had seen this kidnapper before and therefore knew him by sight; and they all started with the determination to thwart him at all hazards. It looked as if the cunning rascal had purposely selected an opportunity when he knew she was alone and no one seemingly around to enter her house. The woman was dumfounded at the sight of her so-called master and scarcely knew what to do or say, and he seeing her <choice><sic>dilema</sic><corr>dilemma</corr></choice> quickly announced to her that she was apprehended and would soon be in the hands of an officer, but that she could escape this trouble by going immediately with him. It was while this palaver was going on, which was all on one side, for his very presence had seem to paralyze the woman, for be stood with arms and hands outstretched and moving like the wings of a vampire. It was while this was in progress that the friends arrived, who immediately and without ceremony entered the house.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301261">Only for an instant did the fiery eyes of Mrs. Prince rest upon the form of the <choice><sic>villian</sic><corr>villain</corr></choice>, as if to be fully assured that it was he, for the next moment she had grappled with him, and before he could fully realize his position she, with the assistance of the colored women that had accompanied her, had dragged him to the door, and thrust him out of the house. By this time quite a number, mostly women and children had gathered near by (Mrs. Chloe Cabot Thomas of the old ladies' home on <choice><sic>Mrytle</sic><corr>Myrtle</corr></choice> Street, Boston, being one of the number), whom Mrs. Prince commanded to come to the rescue, telling them to "pelt him with stones and any thing you can get a hold of," which order they proceeded to obey with alacrity. And the slave holder, in whose countenance surprise and alarm seemed clearly depicted and evidently con-

vinced that he had lost the opportunity of securing his victim, started to retreat, and with his assailants close upon him ran out of the court into Belknap street.</p><q><lg type="stanza"><l>"Down which they drove,</l><l>In dreadful race,</l><l>Pursuers and pursued."</l></lg></q><p xml:id="era1_1301262">Only once did the man turn in his head-long flight when, seeing them streaming after him terribly in earnest, their numbers constantly increasing and hearing in his ears their exultant cries and shouts of derision he redoubled his speed and, turning the corner into Cambridge street was soon lost to view.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301263">Mrs. Dorsey did not leave Boston, but by the advice of friends changed her abiding place to where she would be less likely to be surprised or retaken. But she was never afterwards molested. Nor was Woodfork again seen in this vicinity until 1850 when, in attempting to arrest a fugitive in Old Cambridge he was again put to flight in a similar manner; an account of which may be given hereafter.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_05.06" type="Article"><head rend="center">WOMEN AT HOME </head><docAuthor>Marie Louise Burgess</docAuthor><byline>Marie Louise Burgess.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301264" rend="center">THE DIXIE HOSPITAL AND HAMPTON TRAINING SCHOOL FOR NURSES.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301265">Among the many avenues opened to the colored girls of the south, is that of trained nursing. In June, 1891, the Dixie Hospital was first opened to receive intelligent colored women for training as nurses. It was thought that intelligent nursing ought to take the place of the granny nursing which for so many years has been the main nursing of the southern people. The Dixie Hospital was the avenue by which Hampton and the surrounding country was to receive nurses who were to be trained, and like others of their profession to stand side by side with the physician in caring for the sick and the afflicted.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301266">In the first class there were only two nurses, but by the end of the year there were five. During that time there had been thirty seven patients cared for in the hospital wards. These five nurses above mentioned were Anna De Costa, Rosa Dunstan, seniors; Alberta Boyd, Susie J. Rix, Eliza Blackman, juniors, they were Hampton graduates, excepting Rosa Dunstan who had been promoted to the senior class, and took her year out in the training school. All of these were bright intelligent young women, and a better class of nurses could not be found elsewhere.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301267">This Hospital was incorporated in March, 1892, although started before the Provident training school in Chicago, the latter by being incorporated first, is counted the older.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301268">The thought of starting this noble work, came from Miss Alice M. Bacon, one of Hampton's earnest workers and teachers, one who believes sincerely in a bright future for the negro girl. The hospital is a neat frame building, painted light yellow, has two good sized wards, one male, the other female; and private rooms where private patients are accommodated; adjoining this building is the nurse's home, with all the conveniences of home life so that no nurse can be lonely.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301269">The lecture and operating rooms are in this building.  The Supt. Miss Sarah Connacher is a graduate of the Waltham Training School, for nurses at Waltham, Mass. She is a very able instructor and matron. The nurses wear the usual blue and white seersucker dresses so popular in training schools of this country, the dainty white cap, cuffs and aprons.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301270">The first class of nurses, did not have the comforts of a nurses home, but like true missionaries put up with the best that was given them and saw only the work which wits before them, during their senior year they were able to enjoy the Home.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301271">The amount of charity work done by these nurses cannot be realized, but the cheerfulness with which the work is performed would lead one to believe that nothing unpleasant ever came into their lives. They go from case to case caring for suffering humanity, walking sometimes miles to their cases and back again in the evening. Every one who knows the Dixie nurses, loves and respects them. The guests of the Hygeia Hotel have employed a great many and the best doctors in the neighborhood demand their service. Some have been to New York, others to Norfolk and cities near Hampton.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301272">During the past year a maternity building has been added.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301273">This institution is supported by subscriptions, and donations.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301274">Lectures are given daily for one hour to the juniors during the term in anatomy, obstetrics, medicines, and their administration, massage, 
bandaging and general training, special subjects connected with nursing, and special surgical cases, physiology, cholera and surgery.</p><pb xml:id="era1_1301275" n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era1_1301276">The instructors are physicians in the <choice><sic>neigborhood</sic><corr>neighborhood</corr></choice>.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301277">Applicants for admission must be between twenty-one and thirty-five, have a good common school education be sound mentally, morally and physically. The term is two years, although a certificate is given to those who satisfactorily complete a fifteen month's course.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301278">This is an excellent opportunity for young women who wish to grasp it. What an excellent thing it would be if the race would become interested in this Hospital; show some appreciation of the work, there is much that could be done if only the effort were made.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301279">As a race I fear we are thoughtless, we grasp every opportunity but give little thought to the origin and growth of it.

Oxford, England.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301299">Dear Mrs. Ruffin,</p><p xml:id="era1_1301300">Thank you for the copy of the WOMAN'S ERA just received.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301301">Upon my arrival in Liverpool I began at once to fulfil my promise to you and to others that I would tell the people in England of the injustice done to the colored citizens of the United States. I found the greatest sympathy from the clergy and laity, and an anxiety to hear the truth from an impartial witness.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301302">It was a matter of great regret to me that Miss Ida B. Wells had left England before I arrived as I should have been only too glad to have met her on the platform and endorsed her statements. She has won a great many friends for herself and for the cause which we have at heart. England knows enough to sympathize with the colored people in the states in their efforts to obtain justice. and to improve themselves. The <hi rend="italic">Daily News</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary Review</hi> have had splendid articles upon the subject. These represent the daily, the weekly and the monthly press, but in spite of the information which these have given the English people have comparatively little knowledge of the state of affairs.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301303">I have spoken to many of the clergy in London and Oxford and asked them to raise their voice at every opportunity on behalf justice to the colored people. The English people love justice and have no prejudice and hear with the greatest interest of the efforts which colored people are making to improve their position. Many persons have been surprised to hear of the talent which has been shown by some in literature and art, and of the refinement and culture of many of the men and women vastly superior to many of a fairer complexion. The imprudence of some has done the cause harm even here, but the more visits England can have from people like Miss Wells the more they will be welcomed. I am sure that the WOMAN'S ERA may be a useful means of communication between the women on both sides.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301304">Yesterday I saw the Bishops of Lincoln and of Reading, and in a few days I hope to see the Bishops of London and of Ripon, and to all of them I hope to explain impartially the position of affairs in America.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301305">You may be sure that I shall lose no opportunity of speaking a word to obtain sympathy for those whom I have learned to love and work for in Christ's Holy Church.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301306">May God bless your work, and especially the WOMAN'S ERA.</p><closer xml:id="era1_1301308"><salute>Yours faithfully,</salute><signed><name>C.N.

Her silence may mean many things, so as it is the virtual acknowledgement of her position as a sympathizer with lynchers and a contemptuous indifference to those who espouse the cause of the lynched. To the many colored women who have been enthusiastic listeners to Mrs. Chant's talks, this will come as a blow, but it is not the first of the kind we have received.

Of course a harbor party had to come, first one occurred on Thursday, July the 19th, and was followed by a reception on the next (Friday) evening given by Mrs. E. E. Brown at her home in Boston Highlands to her guests the Misses Wilson of Indianapolis, Ind. The Browns, a young married couple, are already noted for their abundant hospitality and whole heartedness, and the invitations for Friday evening were extended with their usual lavish hand, result, a crush of sweet girls in lovely summer dresses and fine boys in unlovely dress suits. All who were brave enough to face the rigors of that intensely hot night and don party clothes and gloves were made as comfortable and happy as congenial company, delicate viands, iced

drinks and sweet music (by an orchestra in the alcove off the parlor), could make them. Mrs. Mitchel and Mr. Geo. Ruffin sang, and the more courageous among the young people danced a little. All made the acquaintance of the stranger guests. These ladies are the sisters of that distinguished lady the wife of ex-senator Blanche K. Bruce, also ex-recorder of deeds at Washington, D. C.; however, they are not dependent for consideration on any reflected honor from their sister, having a charming and winning personality of their own of which dignified simplicity of manner is the most conspicuous feature. The Misses Wilson were born and begun life in Cleveland, Ohio, as public school teachers, later when it was determined to make the public school system of Indianapolis the best in the country by employing the best teachers tit the largest salaries, these young ladies among others were sent for to help carry out the scheme. They are hard working teachers with an intense love for their work. They have built a lovely home in the city of Indianapolis to which they have removed their loved and honored parents, Dr. and Mrs. Wilson. Their father was for years a successful dentist of Cleveland, Ohio. Doubtless many courtesies will be extended these ladies who are making their first visit to Boston. The strangers at the party were, besides the guests of honor, the Misses Howard, Miss Benjamin, Miss Florence Smith, Miss Hare of Cleveland, Ohio, Mrs. John Downing of Brooklyn, N. Y., Mr. R. G. L.

She was buried from the Union Baptist Church, Cambridge, Sunday the 22nd, with the badges of both societies on her breast and her casket covered with floral tokens of esteem.

GOULD.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301427">"Never in the history of civilization have women been so honored, loved, privileged and trusted as at the present time," writes Mary A. Livermore in an article on the American Girl, published in a recent number of the <hi rend="italic">Youth's Companion</hi>. What they do and what they are is to tell as never before on the national character. Therefore she appeals to the American girl to discard absurd and harmful fashions, and to cultivate a strong, healthy physique. To cease being superficial, inaccurate and unthorough. To embrace the ample opportunities offered for a higher education. The changed condition of life she says, which confront the girl of today, compel a larger education than has heretofore been deemed necessary. Women are to be weighted with larger duties and heavier responsibilities. The doors of colleges, universities and professional schools are open to them. They can pursue the same courses of study as their brothers and graduate with the same diplomas. She would, if possible, change the public sentiment so that every girl, no matter what her position in society, should not be considered thoroughly educated until she had learned a trade, business or profession and was self-supporting.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301428">"Pembroke" is the title of a new novel by Mary E. Wilkins. It is, of course, a story of New England, and indicates that the success the author has attained in short stories is possible to her in a wider field. The story is a homely romance laid in a New England village, whose characters have a narrow range of life and a paucity of ideal incentives. It illustrates the power of a stubborn wilfulness, a family trait that in one person takes the form of a bigoted piety, and in another a blind perversity whose extreme exactings are amusing. In still another person the stubborn nature cherishes an injury until both mind and body are ruined.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301429">"Kerrigan's Quality" is the title of a most interesting story by Jane Barlow, at young Irish authoress whose home is near Dublin. The emerald slopes, the rough sea and the quaint villages are all described as they could only be by one who has lived among them. While the pathetic, shrewd and humorous elements of her characters are presented with a realism true to life.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301430">Mrs. Kate Douglas Wiggin is a young widow who took up writing seriously after the death of her husband. She writes charming stories for young girls which are by some considered to surpass Miss Alcott's. Her "Polly Oliver" is a delightful story containing the most lovable of girl heroines.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301431">It is reported that Henry James is coming home to America to edit a magazine, and that Rudyard Kipling returns to England for the same purpose.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301432">In regard to the magazine which Mr. James is about to edit, it is possible that it will be too characteristic of its editor to appeal to a large class of readers. The later novels of Mr. James can be appreciated only by those whose reading is extensive and whose knowledge of the world is such that they can reflect on the underlying causes of events.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301433">An attractive little volume is that entitled "Aunt Lindy." Its author is Victoria Earle, the nom de plume assumed by Mrs. Wm. E. Matthews, the President of the Woman's Loyal Union of New York. The scene of the interesting little story is laid in the south, and the narrative is a pathetic illustration of 'Coals of fire.' The heroine is a typical woman of the negro race, well advanced in years, whose heart is warm, whose hand is skillful and whose life is devoted to the service of her Maker. The book contains four original illustrations by Mary L. Payne.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301434">Mr. S.R. Crockett, the author of an interesting story of adventure called "The Raiders," is a friend of Robert Louis Stevenson from whom he is said to have learned the art of successful storytelling. He is a Free Church minister and has a charge near Edinburgh. An editor once requested him to write an article on a minister's duties. He wrote it in the form of a story of one day and received a telegram asking for more. Since then he has continued to write. "A Stickit Minister" is his most successful book. The scene of "The Raiders" is laid in Galloway, and the time is the early part of the eighteenth century. It is charming for vigor, breadth, adventure, landscape and character.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_05.19" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_1301435"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we151.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 5.

Miss Blanche D. Washington.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301504">Miss Blanche D. Washington is another example of what the race is doing in the world's advancement. She is one of the plucky, patient and persistent workers in the world of music, and notwithstanding the many drawbacks that beset her early pathway, chief of which was ill health, still, standing today as model teacher her fame is second to none.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301505">Miss Washington resides at home with her mother, who is a successful business woman, being a celebrated manicurist. They are charmingly domiciled at 120 West and 26th Streets, New York, in handsome luxuriously furnished apartments which bear every appearance of refined and cultivated tastes.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301506">While Miss Washington would not be considered a beautiful women, still, she has an intense personal charm, which has been the means of drawing about her an immediate circle of friends. At the age of thirteen, she commenced the study of the piano under some of the most prominent professors of New York City, Her progress was so rapid that all who knew her prophesied for her a great future. At fifteen she began teaching some little friends of hers and from that time on her life has been passed chiefly in teaching music And in order to give her pupils the best possible instructions, she is continually studying up methods of teaching from the best masters. Last year she attended Scharwenka Conservatory of Music, entering the class for teachers. This year she is studying harmony and composition in the National Conservatory of Music. She is also the composer of several pieces of music, her most recent and successful being a military schottische entitled "Friendship's Greeting."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301507">Miss Washington claims that no true musician can expect to advance with the times without continual study. In addition to her regular teaching she has formed a class of all her pupils which meet for the inculcation of a thorough knowledge of the theory of music. That she also cherishes an ideal, is found in the fact that she is endeavoring to establish a Conservatory of Music, where for a nominal sum the best of instruction in all the branches can be obtained, for, as she says, while the White Conservatory offers till advantages and is open to all, the charges are beyond the means of the majority of colored-Americans. In this brief sketch it is impossible for the writer to say all that might be said in reference to the work of this charming woman, but still, I am glad of an opportunity to introduce, even through an inadequate description, one more of the clever women of the race to the many readers of the Woman's Era.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301508">The above is the first of a series of pen-portraits of "Women Worth Knowing," which will appear in this journal</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.03" type="Filler"><head rend="center">Help in Choosing a School.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301509">The publishers of the WOMAN'S ERA will, on application of any of its subscribers, send catalogues and all information easily obtainable, concerning any academy, college, normal, music, or art school in New England, on receipt of stamped and directed envelope.

News had been brought from a neighboring city that the mob which a few days before had fallen upon New York, burning houses, killing helpless women and children--the mob that had left New York streets one mass of trampled human bodies--was coming to Bainbridge to continue its murderous work. Men gathered in groups on the street and talked in grave low tones then separated to make ready their guns and pistols. A neighbor came in to tell my mother the worst that was expected. For answer she gave him a look pitiable in its helplessness; then she stretched out her hand toward us children and looked about wildly as if for some way of escape.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301513">Nothing happened that night, and with returning day hearts grow stronger. But at evening the men came home again with faces full of foreboding and that night no man in the town slept. The twilight deepened, darkness settled down unrelieved by it single gleam of light from the houses. A dreadful stillness pervaded the streets, and in the window of each of these darkened homes sat a silent watcher.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301514">My mother tremblingly put together a few things in a bundle; I closely followed her. I think my child's heart recognized that her fright was as great as my own. Our house was surrounded by a low paling fence over which any school-boy might easily have vaulted, but the little gate of this fence my mother tied with yards of clothes line. Against the front door she pulled our heavy mahogany sofa. But, after all, how defenceless we were. Oh the happy children who were protected by a "big man with a gun."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301515">When everything was done, my mother laid us children, fully dressed, upon the bed and sat down beside it at the open window. I took fast hold of her dress and lay straining my eyes in the darkness to keep her outlines. I was in an agony of fear lest somehow I should lose her, and kept fastening my slipping fingers nearer to the gathers of her dress. I think I must have fallen asleep and then wakened--wakened to the awful darkness--wakened to find that I had lost her. I [scream]ed in terror. I felt her almost spring upon m[e to sil]ence me; then she gathered me close up t[o her an]d again took up her watch.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301516">Suddenly the stillness became full of a commotion that I felt, rather than saw or heard. My mother grasped the bundle beside her, dragged us both to our feet, then stood listening.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301517">From the direction in which the men had been watching came a sound like that of horses' feet. There was noiseless running and husky whispering in the streets. The clattering noise grew clearer. I was leaning from the window now beside my mother, and in a moment more we saw the twinkle of lights carried by men on horseback with tall plumes upon their heads. Then men came tearing through the streets, the frantic joy of their voices breaking the terrible silence. "The soldiers! The soldiers! They've come to protect us!"</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.05" type="Essay"><head rend="center">WOMEN AT HOME.</head><docAuthor>Marie Louise Burgess </docAuthor><byline>MARIE LOUISE BURGESS.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1301518" rend="center"><hi rend="bold">Typhoid Fever.</hi></p><p xml:id="era1_1301519">Fever has a combination of symptoms, as inflammation of lungs, bowels, joints, etc. Patients in such instances become emaciated. Good knowledge <choice><sic>off ever</sic><corr>of fever</corr></choice> is necessary. One can tell by the temperature and pulse; flushing of face; dry skin and coated tongue; rise of temperature when it rises to a certain height and lasts a certain time. The temperature is taken in five minutes. The Hicks thermometer is the very best and all families should possess at least one. The pulse is caused by the systole and diastole, contraction and expansion of the heart; it may be felt at the radial and temporal arteries. The adult pulse is taken at the radial artery in the wrist and should average 72 beats in a minute; in a babe it is best taken at the temporal artery and averages from 100 to 120 beats in a minute. Motion, exercises, dancing, etc., cause quicker pulse, and also eating. It beats from 60 to 70 in men, 72 to 84 in women. In cases of fever a pulse of 120 and a temperature of 102 degrees are dangerous.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301521">The most important symptoms of typhoid fever are languor, headache and backache, nervousness, pain in the limbs, chills, feverish in the evening, temperature low in the morning, but rises to 103 or 104 at night; constipation, oftentimes diarrhea. Typhoid fever is supposed to come from some poisonous germ entering the bowels either through the water we drink <gap extent="10" unit="chars" reason="tape"/> be caused by bad drainage, etc. Th<gap extent="12" unit="chars" reason="tape"/>lly lasts

twenty-one days, rising gradually morning and evening until it reaches its climax, then turns and gradually drops. During the time the patient is usually very ill, requiring the greatest care in nursing. Oftentimes he is delirious and very hard to manage. Milk diet should be given at regular intervals and no solid food until the doctor orders it. Oftentimes the patient has to be fed in small quantities, every hour or even half hour in a day that the proper amount of nourishment be taken in twenty-four hours. The bowels are in such a condition that if a piece of solid food were given before they are able to receive it, they would become punctured and death would be the result. The diet of a typhoid patient is his principal treatment while convalescing and a nurse has to be very careful.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301522">When the patient is first taken and has a chill, he should be put to bed in a large, airy, well ventilated room with not too many bed clothes, but warm and light. Eider-down puffs are objectionable. If the patient remains chilly, hot water bottles should be applied to feet and back and the skin may be rubbed with warm flannel cloths. A little hot water and brandy may be drunk.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301523">Generally heat follows chills, then sponge with cold or tepid water. Give plenty of water to drink and cracked ice. Compresses and ice bags may be applied externally. During the perspiring time wipe body with warm flannel ; after perspiring is done change bed cloths and the patients, if possible, move into another bed. During this do not let the patient sit up, as some part of the intestines is inflamed. Give milk, gruel and stimulants, nothing but liquids; only give as much milk as is easily digested, in very small quantities.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301524">Never waken unless sleep is too long and then raise the head gently and, administer the food. Give plenty of water, lemonade, barley water or toast water during the fever. Bed sores often come in acute diseases. Sponge baths ought to be given once or twice -daily during the fever. Symptoms of bed sores are redness, swelling and rawness. Sheets should be changed often and kept smooth, and the sacrum, hips, heels and elbows bathed with alcohol or brandy and water. Brandy and Bi-Chloride of Mercury 1-500, Oxide of Zinc powder used also. If skin is broken, air pillows should he used, zinc ointment or collodion and caster oil: When a black spot appears, wash with carbolic and apply poultices of flax-seed meal.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301525">A good nurse will never have a bed sore on her patient; it is considered the most disgraceful thing and reflects very badly upon the nursing. Always wash the patient's mouth before and after each feeding; a fever patient's mouth tastes badly from the condition of the stomach. Every dejection should be disinfected and immediately disposed of, for in typhoid fever the contagion is in the dejections. The temperature of the room should be 68 degrees and carefully watched.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.06" type="News"><head rend="center">NEWS FROM THE CLUBS.</head><div xml:id="era1_06.06.01" type="News"><docAuthor>Anna M.

We wish that this question might be figuratively and literally impressed upon the mind of each of our young people, and that they would so diligently seek for the answer that it also would come, whether in the "still small voice" or in the "rushing mighty wind," so clearly and definitely that no possible mistake could be made in its significance.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301545">A conversation recently took place between a party of white persons as to which race or nationality each one would prefer to be a member of. Having disposed of the Irish, Germans and Chinese, greatly to the disadvantage of these people, one remarked, "But I would be ashamed to be colored!" Ah, thought I, upon overhearing the remark, is not this the cause of much of our race trouble? Are we not, generally speaking, <hi rend="italic">ashamed to be colored?</hi> Carrying this shamefacedness about with us in direct proportion to the amount of pigment distributed to us, instead of rising superior to the conditions which confront us and forcing the world by means of RESULTS ATTAINED to admit that "A man is a man for all that," we tacitly proclaim ourselves to be objects of pity and disgust, and receive exactly the wages we ask for--contempt and pity.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301546">At a meeting of the Kansas City League, July 30th, the work of Miss Ida Wells in England and this country was formally endorsed and the hope expressed that she might continue in the good work so well begun.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301547">August 13th Lawyer T.F.

The president of the W.E.C. conceived the idea of using her vacation in visiting other clubs, and prominent club women in their summer houses or wherever they might be found, started out simply with the expectation of coming home filled with ideas and enthusiasm for the inspiration of her own club family.

Of course at this season only a very small part of the membership the W. L.

Many complimentary and encouraging words were said of women and their present activity, and Mrs. Matthews' plan of forming chapters of the W. L. L. in all the large churches of New York and Brooklyn was unfolded and heartily approved. After August, these Sunday evening meetings will be continued and the plan more definitely detailed. If Mrs. Matthews' plan is carried out as she outlines it, New York will be the home of a powerful organization for good works, and the class of women Mrs. Matthews has gathered around her as helpers assures the stability and efficiency of the work. In the metropolis, as might be expected, there are a large number of women of means and a larger number of women with brains, who give the support of their intelligent sympathy and money to work laid out for them by their energetic leader, and in the hands of such well known and capable ladies its Mrs. H.

But this young girl's life has been an unusually sad and pathetic one. Being early left an orphan and the sole support of a crippled grandfather, she saw no way to carry out the cherished desire of her heart, cultivate her voice, until her attention was called to the offer made in the, ERA. Now, through the kind sympathy of friends who know her talent and worthiness and the liberality of the publishers of the ERA, a way has been opened for Miss Fisher to acquire a profession by which it is hoped she may he enabled to more easily carry the burdens heaped upon her young shoulders. A few more subscribers secured and the scholarship is hers. A liberal percentage will also he allowed her for expenses in coming to Boston and returning to her charge in New Bedford, and, with the supervision the publishers of this paper have pledged themselves to have over her while studying in Boston, they feel that they are carrying out their settled policy of helping women to help themselves. The third premium, offered to children obtaining 25 subscribers, is still open, and through it an unusual opportunity is given to parents to immediately place their little beginners in music under the careful training of first-class teachers. The Boston Training School of Music is one of the best in New England, and a year's tuition in such a school for only a little energetic canvassing on the part of a child, is a lasting benefit received for comparatively nothing.

Such societies can easily be started in tiny school or community.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301563">The object is to encourage small savings, either by children or adults. No sum is too small to be received. It is expected that the deposits will be mainly of pennies, and when a deposit reaches the sum of five dollars the depositor is expected to transfer it to a savings bank.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301564">The plan is very simple. In exchange for one cent, three cents, or any like sum, the depositor receives a stamp of the denomination of the sum deposited. This stamp is pasted in a book bearing depositor's name and address, When the book is full of stamps, a new one is received and also an account book. At any time books can be redeemed simply by presentation.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301565">The outfit for a society costs but little. The book-keeping is almost nothing, as each book keeps itself. In large cities, there is usually a central station where books are issued and stamps sold in bulk; besides which there are branch stations where money is received and stamps sold by retail.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301566">By such an institution it is an easy matter to teach children to save. Poor children spend many more pennies than rich and get into habits which are ruinous to thrift. Some one tells a story about a family set out of doors for nonpayment of rent, and while their poor old rickety furniture blocked the streets, their children were constantly running to and fro spending pennies for all kinds of foolishness. For every stamp deposited a child receives something tangible--a bright pretty stamp, and pastes it into his own book. Then, too, he becomes ambitious to fill up his book and denies himself to do it. Besides encouraging the saving habit, it is a great material help, many children being often enabled to get a new dress or pair of shoes with money that would otherwise have been worse than wasted.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.10" type="Report"><p xml:id="era1_1301567">The Committee of Council and Co-operation is a delegate committee consisting of not more than three members from any association, whose "object is to promote a spirit of unity and helpfulness among the associating societies, and to facilitate active co-operation in measures and departments of work of common interest."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301568">Their method is to work quietly to effect their object and only to report to the public results accomplished.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301569">There are now thirteen societies represented in the committee: Young Woman's Christian Association, Woman's Charity Club, Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Physiological Institute, Moral Education Association, Moral Reform Association, Woman's Press Association, Ladies' Aid of the Soldiers' Home, Helping Hand Society, Mass.

In fact it is the brethren who are most anxious about their meat and drink and who see in women, possibly rivals, who are most concerned about woman's place in the church, and that it shall not be such as shall rob them of any honor or <hi rend="italic">profit</hi>. Such men tell us that common sense must be used in the interpretation of the Scriptures in a passage like the above. They acknowledge that changed conditions of living necessitate a liberal translation, and yet are so narrow as not to see that while the women of the year A. D. 32 were probably not prepared by training or opportunity to either teach or preach, that it is no argument that the woman of A. D. 1900, after years of culture and study may not be able to interpret the Scriptures as lucidly as "Guardian" at least; because Paul told woman what, with their limited opportunities they might do, it is an insult to his and their intelligence to conclude that they must not develop and use future opportunities. It is according to law, gospel, history and common sense that woman's place is where she is needed and where she fits in and to say that the place will affect her womanliness is bosh; womanliness is an attribute not a condition, it is not supplied or withdrawn by surroundings, it may be lacking in the most feeble and protected woman, and strong in her who is the sole support of her little ones and has to fight the flesh, the devil and the world too, in their behalf. It is spurious womanliness that only manifests itself in certain surroundings.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301607">The Illustrated American has been publishing a series of prize papers for and against Woman Suffrage. As an argument for suffrage it is the best thing that has been devised lately.  The weak effusive arguments against suffrage can have but one effect on the indifferent, and that is to turn them into suffragists so that by no mistake they may be counted among these remonstrants. The thing that strikes the readers more than anything else is the constantly repeated argument and fear that through suffrage woman will lose her womanliness, this is the strength of the opposition and it means only one of two things, either the opposition is weak or it is blind, in either case it merits little attention.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301608">It is as impossible for woman to turn back as for time--they are bound to march on. Only let them be patient and calm--not unduly excited and aggressive over these small attacks; let them treat them as the strong womanly woman treat all pin pricks.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_1301609" n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_06.14.02" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">Mr. Fortunes Question.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301610">In discussing his own question, "Are we brave men or cowards?" T. Thomas Fortune in the August Monthly Review makes a severe arraignment of both the white and black races in this country, from the point of view of one who has hoped much from both and been disappointed. He puts his case strongly, and supports it with undeniable facts, facts so, self-evident as to call for no emphasis here, except to draw attention to some phases of the question--the responsibility or the negro himself for allowing a continuance of existing conditions because of his inability to organize for the general welfare, because of his utter lack of veneration for, and support of worthy and capable leaders, and the dwarfing effect of vast charity bestowed and willingly accepted by him. These are some of the causes, Mr. Fortune claims that are having the effect of keeping the race in its own, and the estimation of others, but "As children of larger growth." Of course the usual number will rise up to berate the asker of the question and make the usual charge of traducing and discouraging the race, because like a true healer Mr. Fortune seeks first to locate the cause of the trouble; if in doing so the sensitive wound is hurt, all the more evident is it that an unhealthy condition exists; true progress is not possible until a healthy, manly condition is obtained. Time was when the exigences of the case compelled the largest allowance of charity for the short-comings of a race just graduated into manhood, but after a quarter century or opportunity, though limited, failure to strengthen the belittling weaknesses which so hinder and retract us in the fight for existence, is inexcusable and in the present critical condition of things, fatal. Timid men and ignorant men should stand aside, they and the mendicant who stands always with <choice><sic>outsretched</sic><corr>outstretched</corr></choice> hand for alms possess not the spirit for leadership. All too long has the way been blocked by bold incompetents who misrepresent, by burlesquing the colored people of the country. The time is come when they must stand aside for others more capable and more independent. Now also the whole race should realize the importance of doing its share of giving, as well as taking in more ways than one.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.14.03" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">Negro Folk-Lore.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301611">One of the interesting institutions at Hampton is the society for the study of Negro Folk-Lore and Ethnology. A few years ago a similar society was formed in Boston among the colored people, which was the first of its kind in the country. Although there were a few enthusiasts the society died from lack or interest.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301612">There have been and are two strong sides as to the value of such work. There are those who believe firmly that the sooner the colored man loses and <hi rend="italic">forgets</hi> his characteristics, the better it be for himself and other Americans. In a lecture delivered in Boston some time ago, George W. Cable advised the colored people to make all haste to drop those marks distinctly negroid, to strive to write like a white man, dress, act, and talk like one, and so hasten on the day when they will be distinguished only as "Americans." Others believe just as firmly that the best good of the race is served by preserving all characteristics that are worth preserving; that we have attributes, of mind and characteristics of expression that might rather be copied by the other race rather than dropped by us. At any rate, it can but help to dignify the race to preserve its anecdotes and songs, the work that is being done by the Folk-Lore Society.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.14.04" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">Father Grimes and Father Field.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301614">Over forty years have passed since Lenard A. Grimes, of revered memory, came to Boston with his wife and four little children. He had just been released from a second imprisonment in a southern jail for persistently aiding and abetting slaves to escape from bondage. He was converted to Christianity in prison, and on reaching Boston immediately threw himself with ardor into evangelistic work. A ripe field he found for his zeal at the West End of the city, and having attracted to himself some of the best people of Boston and vicinity, he founded a church, and by almost superhuman effort, built and paid for an edifice for his people to worship in. He ably planned, and lived to help execute the plans for the most beneficent of all charities, the "Home for Aged and Infirm Colored Women" an institution conceived, started and carried off for a while by him, with but little aid or encouragement from any source. He died in the fulness of the activities of a loving minister to people of all creeds, colors and condition. His title of "Father" grew out of the paternal, loving interest he showed in the affairs of his parishioners, and he was commonly called so by all citizens. For long years after the death of Father Grimes his place remained vacant.

Although many were tried, none were found able to take up the work where the Rev. Mr. Grimes left it twenty years ago until the Rev. Father Field stepped in, and today in his successful work for the closing up of the liquor saloons, in cleaning up the homes of the poor of the neighborhood, in his trade schools and in his latest and most significant achievement, the securing of a branch of the public library for the West End with all that that implies, he is unconsciously, perhaps, making realities of some of Father Grimes most cherished dreams.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.14.05" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">The "Wonderful" Sam Jones.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301615">That disgusting mountebank, Sam Jones, the evangelist, should find no place among real Christians.

It explains in the form of a sroty the need of clubs for women and the good they accomplish. A great many women who are outside of the club movement are of the opinion that they are only for the highly educated, or are composed of strong minded women who, oblivious of home duties, spend their time discussing woman suffrage and social reform in the loudest of voices. To such as are of that opinion, this "Story of a Club" can but be a revelation. Even if a club as a body does not do anything for the outside world in the way of charity that will reflect credit on itself, it will accomplish untold good by raising its members individually from the ruts of their daily lives, and giving them an insight into the lives and purposes of others.

We might well ask, "Whither are we tending?" when so many ennobling, edifying and interesting books are allowed to remain on the library shelves uncalled for and unread. It is we women who are responsible for the present trend in literature, for it is the women who do the novel reading. Is there not something wrong in our education when we prefer the sensational and dramatic phases of life to life as it really is, as is found in history? Mr. Howells says that the American girl is not educated; that she reads nothing but novels, and those according to fashion and not on their merits.

Her millinery is positively sentimental creations, thrown in splendid relief by her beautiful black eyes and midnight tresses. Speaking of her, one instinctively thinks of her sweet little chum whom a tall, Saratogian will lead to Hymen's altar in the near future. It is positively distresing to think of the many bright girls who will in the fall add to the already over-crowded ranks of fascinating matrons.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301648">Miss V.

As his ancestry has left so light a trace of its individualizing touch on complexion, feature or manner, strange things and revelations may be in store for those who are so sure that the colored man is the symbol of prayer and peace.

The story was a most startling one and aroused the interest and attention of everybody. The Woman's Era Club through its president at once began an investigation in which it was very much aided by Sawyer Plummer of this city.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301682">The girl when interviewed at the home of Dr. Crocker presented a very interesting personality; about sixteen years of age. She was exceedingly well-grown with the very noble features which often accompany a dark skin; she appeared modest and reticent and suffering at the time with an aggravated case of heart disease, she excited the interest and sympathy of all her visitors; her story was most startling.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301683">She claimed to have been born in Beaufort, S. C., and lived there with her parents until ten or twelve years of age. At that time a northern lady, Mrs. Hanson, who was visiting the south with an invalid friend, saw her and attracted by her had persuaded her mother to let her take the child north; Mrs. Hanson drew such an attractive picture of the life the child would lead, of the advantages she would have that the mother sent the girl willingly. After reaching Boston, according to Mary's story, they were driven to a street in South Boston, and entered it house which Mary never left for four years. In telling the tale of her life in this prison Mary went into the minutest detail. She was confined to a back-kitchen and wood shed during the day and an attic at night.. She was obliged to rise before daylight, was only allowed a fire in the kitchen stove while cooking, was fed on the scraps front the table and went bare foot all the time; she was never allowed in the front of the house and the window in the wood shed was barred and locked.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301684">The story of her escape was in keeping with the rest. A colored woman who worked for a married daughter of the family heard of her, managed to see her and to give her a quarter of dollar and an address and advised her to escape. One summer night Mary secreted the key of the wood shed, and after the family went to bed unlocked the door and escaped. It was very near midnight, however, before she had succeeded in getting free; she was then barefooted and dressed in a ragged gown which only reached her knees. She had not left the house long before a terrible thunder storm arose and she sought refuge in the car house where she waited for the early morning car to Boston. She succeeded in finding the people whose address had been given to her, was put to bed from which she did not rise for many months. After a partial recovery she sought another service place, but from impaired health was unable to do much work. She went from place to place and finally landed with Dr. Crocker of Huntington Avenue to whom she told the tale and who at once took steps to circulate, it to seek out Mr. and Mrs. Hanson, and to interest people in behalf of the girl whose health had reached such a stage that an early death was expected. The story caused a sensation and steps were taken to find and prosecute the slave holder. Money and gifts were offered the girl who received every attention with quiet dignity.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301685">After much trouble the Hanson family were located and interviewed. From letters front the girl's mother and former teacher in the possession of Mrs. Hanson it was found that almost every thing told by the girl was pure fabrication. The girl had left the south when about the age of fourteen in company with other girls and women seeking service places in the north. She had gone to Mrs. Hanson to take care of children and had lived with her two months only, during which time she had been out nearly every day with the children and at the time she was in very poor health.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301686">When the truth was discovered the girl was immediately <choice><sic>despatched</sic><corr>dispatched</corr></choice> to a hospital for treatment, and when last heard from had not been discharged.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301687">To those who saw the girl and heard the piteous tale she told, interrupted by the painfully drawn breath, who followed the details told so graphically it seemed almost impossible that the story should be a fabrication; and yet, without doubt, it is, and it is only repeated here in answer to many requests and for the benefit of many interested people who have learned the sequel for the first time.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301688">Whether the girl is mentally unbalanced is not known; in any case she is an interesting study to the psychologist.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_06.18" type="Correction"><p xml:id="era1_1301689">CHICAGO, ILL., Aug. 20, 1894.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301690">In the July number of the WOMAN'S ERA, in the biography of Mrs. R.E.

Frederick Douglass." Long before the wide, hospitable portals were reached the house could be seen nestling, as it were, in slumberous quiet 'neath great sighing trees.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301772">It sets north and south, planned after the typical southern fashion of more than a generation ago; a two-story and garret brick house painted white, green window blinds, a bay-window in the centre of the second story, two more at the eastern side of the large drawing-room. A wide, old-fashioned piazza runs the entire length of the front, the centre of which is decorated by open latticework, and the whole supported by four large white columns; wide steps running the limit of the piazza, which is fitted up with hammock, rustic seat and rockers - the very picture of repose, comfort, and all that is peaceful. The trees about seem to mark and emphasize the most attractive individuality of the place--retirement 'mid soft, shadowy <choice><sic>lovliness</sic><corr>loveliness</corr></choice>, the silent dispenser of rest,--"rest to the weary." So irresistible is this soothing atmosphere that one instinctively feels the charm of silence and meditative environment ere he has passed beyond the wide entrance of the spacious old mansion; but when in the imposing presence of its white-haired master everything seems absorbed by the stirring, fiery personality of a most wonderful man; not only wonderful among a class of people, but all men of the earth regardless of creed or condition -- he stands a living monument of the possibilities of man, a monument to the cause and principles that strong men have died for. The earth holds no nobler, no more truly great, none more worthy universal love and venerated esteem than this gentle-voiced, kindly-mannered, uncrowned king, whose reign and kingdom is the hearts of millions of men!</p><p xml:id="era1_1301774">There's a splendid slope on the western side of the house where he delights in standing, and well he might, for it has no equal in all the district. It commands an uninterrupted view of the city of Washington from an altitude of 133 feet, the gleaming waters of the placid Potomac shimmering between. From this point the great white dome of the Capitol can be seen and, close by, the beautiful structure, designed and now in course of building for the Congressional Library, of pure white marble in strong contrast to the Capitol. It is crowned with a massive golden dome --like the sun and silver of youth and age together they stand surrounded by every condition of human life and progress; and still, beyond to the west, the great Washington monument towers over 550 feet mid-air. A clear morning, the scene unfolds before the observers on Cedar Hill like a dream city born of inspiration, and established by enchantment; and peculiarly impressive it all is when Frederick Douglass stands there with uncovered bead, his fine white hair blowing with the breeze, his massive form erect, standing out in bold relief with his beloved trees as a back-

ground. Marvelous changes of time and state, time-honored gradations of earthly power, inspired touch of Poesy and Romance, when compared with the meed of his experience, pale into feebleness, for no character known to authentic history has encompassed more of the extremes of life than his, and will in time prove, if it has not already proven, the beautiful source of inspiration to not only the emotional muse of poetry, but the fiery realms of heroic tragedy as, well. His course from the beginning stands forth to the world as America's great epic. Who has conquered and vanquished greater foes and obstacles, single-handed, than he? Nobly he wears the weight of three-score and ten years of active usefulness, his vision clear, and his step as active as most men twenty years younger, The great parts he has played in the most tragic scenes of American life have not, as one might have supposed, left him shorn of the faculty of enjoying quiet; not so; he has emerged from the din of battle grateful for the quiet meditative silence of his beloved home.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301775">His home life is simple and altogether free from restraint. The world of good people is made welcome at his portals, character and worth being the passports required. No distinctions are made socially ; it is man and woman, regardless of color, past condition or inheritance, and daily there are pictures seen and enacted here rarely met with beyond the limits of a grand stage.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301777">I call to mind one gem-like evening when, in the ordinary course of neighbors dropping in, a beautiful golden-haired maiden presided at the piano; and among the company were two elderly gentlemen, father and son, the latter an artist of great merit, -- Messer, I think, is the name -- the elder, like Mr. Douglass, is a performer on the violin. After considerable music, vocal and instrumental, with a kindly twinkle in his eyes, the elder Mr. Messer passed to Mr. Douglass' side with his mellow-toned instrument, and awakened the familiar strains of "Auld Lang Syne." Bending low, with his eyes fixed upon the "Sage of Anacostia," his whitened hair in picturesque harmony  with Mr. Douglass' snowy locks, as the sweet familiar tones vibratedon the air, about the works were sung with thrilling effect by "Our Douglass," the picture they made was worthy a painter's brush. Few eyes in that room were undimmed with tears when the music ceased; but such is of ordinary occurrence at Cedar Hill. I have said his home life is simple; well, it is. He rises very early, and before breakfast it is his habit to stroll about his grounds, which consist in all about sixteen acres of undulating land, partly under cultivation, raising sufficient fruit and vegetables for the family use, and flowers for the dainty decoration of table and parlors. I felt very proud, on my first morning stroll, to be rewarded by a cluster of white southern lilies culled and presented me by my honored and revered host, whose mind and heart has caused lilies of thought and resolution to spring into rich growth in every clime where'er civilization extends. He breakfasts with the family at 7 A. M., after which he retires to a quaint retreat in the rear of the mansion, a tiny structure looking more like a fine "mi lady " doll house than anything else; it is Mr. Douglass' "sanctum sanctorum," however, known as the "Growlery " (from Dickens). It is almost covered with vines and embowered by tall lilac shrubs. The Growlery is sufficiently removed from the house to insure absolute quiet; it contains, besides a comfortable lounge, a brick hearth and modern grate for winter use, a tall desk, where Mr. Douglass does his writing standing there's just room enough for the books and papers of immediate necessity, and himself, and, what is dearer to him than strangers can at first understand, his <hi rend="italic">croquet set</hi>. To say that he is an ardent admirer of the game is to express it mildly--he is more--an enthusiast, and as everyone is aware who knows, even slightly, the domestic side of his nature, that he is an expert player. After spending the morning in his Growlery (as if he ever needed a place in which to growl !)he emerges in answer to the midday dinner-bell, after which he watches the sun gradually recede from his croquet lawn, and so soon as it is sufficiently shady, and the work dress of blue is replaced by it fine white flannel, he is ready for his game. The ladies of the house are all good players, Mrs. Douglass and Miss Fog particularly so. Frequently such men as the Hon. John R. Lynch, Mr. Bailey, president of the Capitol Savings Bank, Mr. Robt. Terrell and many others, find relaxation from business cares in this absorbing diversion. Mr. Douglass' grandson, Joselph Douglass, the gifted violinist, is spoken of as a most excellent shot; Mrs. Robt. Terrell and Mrs. Lewis Douglass are particularly noted not only for thier skill, but for certain charming qualities, which tend to enliven and make wonderfully entertaining the game, even for losers. It is very amusing to watch a contest between Mr. Douglass and the above mentioned gentlemen, they are all so
<pb xml:id="era1_1301776" n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
serious. They do not regard their bost's career in their contests; they play seriously to win. But Mr. Douglass rarely misses an aim, and his superior skill is best evidenced by his unerring field shots. To watch his lively interest in following the game and the course of a ball, his field being large, one could easily fancy him a score younger than his own figures testify; his vitality is a constant source of happy amazement to all who enjoy the privilege of either taking sides with or against him. As a rule the tea-bell ends the contests, and after a light repast the evening is given over to the most pleasurable diversion offering itself--sometimes quiet chat, in which reminiscences take the lead, a game of checkers or music. Just before retiring, after "good night " has been said to guests in general, 'tis his regular custom to smoke one segar, sitting in a big rocker on the piazza, listening to the murmuring sound of insect life, or wandering up and down the grounds watching with quiet interest the myriads of twinkling lights, that mark the pathway of the gently gliding Potomac and' stretching around and through the city beyond ; and now that skill and science has succeeded in illuminating the headdress of the Goddess of Liberty on the Capitol, it is indeed an uplifting picture.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301778">The family habits are about the same day after day; the most notable changes being the guests that journey over long distances to stand in the presence of Frederick Douglass; and the tide is largely like that one, known to poesy, that goes on forever.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301779">Men of affairs, women too, come for guidance; and minds, restless with the fires of ambition, journey here for inspiration, and to all he is, in the purest sense, sire, brother, and Pythian friend.

Patterson, who graduated from Oberlin College in '62. The schools of the district have sustained an irreparable loss in the death of Miss Patterson, who, for twenty-five years, rendered valuable service as a teacher. When Oberlin College opened its doors to women, she was courageous, indeed, who dared to brave public opinion by taking what was commonly called the gentleman's course, on the principle that it belonged exclusively to the lords of creation, and no women need apply. only 3-oan 'g women of the loftiest ambition and the keenest thirst, for knowledge presented themselves -,is candidates for the degree of A. B. Miss Patterson was among the first to prove to the world that Greek and the higher mathematics could be mastered not only by young women of the favored race, but by their sisters of the oppressed race as well. Nothing better reveals the fine spirit, the resolute will, and the strong intellectuality of Miss Patterson than her decision to take and complete the classical course at that period.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301788">The Colored Woman's League has been invited to send delegates to the National Council of Women of the United States, to convene them from Feb. 17 to March 2, 1895. One spokesman will be elected to bring greetings from the League to the Council. Only national Organizations are invited to participate in the meetings, on account of the large number of societies of which the Council is composed. Such an invitation from such an important body as the Council furnishes another proof of the advantage of a national organization of colored women. If they are to become an important factor in solving the knotty problems of race and sex, they must get a hearing, and play a conspicuous part in the deliberations which look toward that end. Let them unite themselves into one grand national organization which shall extend from the Pacific to the Atlantic, and from Maine to the Gulf.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301789">Mrs. A.J. Cooper, Mrs. Grimke and Mr. John Wesley Cromwell read papers on Negro Folk Music at the last meeting of the Washington Folk Lore Society.

While they plod alone, they will also profit alone, when the results of their researches are given to the public. This is by no means a bad idea. With Rev. Alex. Crummell as president, Mrs. A. J.

"Now, that's hard to tell," said a wise sister some years her Senior. "I believe beauty is the surest road to success," said a friend who overheard the conversation. "By no means," said the wiseacre to whom the first question was propounded; "there are more exceptions to the rule of beauty than can be found in an English spelling-book." "Is it intelligence?" persisted

the young lady, more anxious and more interrogative than ever. "Just the faintest suspicion of that; just enough to be a bit witty and able to see the point of a stray joke which the hero of the hour sees fit to perpetrate," continued the Minerva of the group. "The young men seem to forgive a lack of brain more easily than they can the absence of other qualities," she continued; "no, no, child, don't give too much time to the cultivation of the brain, if you want to be a reigning belle here. Spend your extra time and money in adorning the person, and let your mind take care of itself, if you want the men to admire you. Be known as a power in the world of fashion.

"To me it seems a brutal sport, in spite of the sanction given it by English and American universities. It gives me a chill to hear a young woman rhapsodize over the game, for it seems incongruous with womanly delicacy. Yes, I know some very fine women enthuse over the game, but if they are sound on other points, I explain this little weakness by ascribing it to a mental obliquity in the first stage of development!" "It is it fad to rave over foot-ball," explained a young co-ed in a tone of horror and disgust. "If you can not thrill over center-rushes, halfbacks and touch-downs, you label yourself a relic of the candle and bird-cage crinoline period." "It is a brutal sport," persisted the first speaker, just as firm and as far from conversion to the new regime as ever. "Harvard is to be congratulated upon having a sensible president, who discourages foot-ball, as it is now played, and is doing his utmost to have the brutality and barbarity eliminated from it."</p><p xml:id="era1_1301796">Read our advertisements.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_08.06" type="Social_Notes"><head rend="center">LOUISIANA.</head><docAuthor>Alice Ruth Moore</docAuthor><byline>ALICE RUTH MOORE, EDITOR. </byline><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">How few of us,</l><l>In all the world's great ceaseless struggling strife,</l><l>Go to our work with gladsome, buoyant step,</l><l>And love it for its sake, whate'er it be.</l><l>Because it is a labor, or, mayhap,</l><l>Some sweet, peculiar art of God's own gift,</l><l>And not the promise of the world's slow smile</l><l>Of recognition, or of Mammon's gilded grasp,</l><l>Alas, how few, in inspirations dazzling flash,</l><l>Or spiritual sense of worlds beyond the dome</l><l>Of circling blue around this weary earth,</l><l>Can bask, and know the God given grace</l><l>Of genius' fire that flows and permeates</l><l>The virgin mind alone, the soul in which</l><l>The love of earth hath tainted not,</l><l>The love of art, and art alone.</l></lg><p xml:id="era1_1301797">After many years of waiting, the colored women of New Orleans have at last organized a Woman's Club. New Orleans has her Portia Club, her Quarantes and Geographic, but their doors are opened only to the more favored sisters. For a long while there were faint hints of it following in this line, but it was not until the 6th of October that nineteen women, old and young, met in the basement of the Tulane Ave. Baptist church to discuss the plans for a woman's club. The gathering, as a whole, seemed ripe for the movement, and without further parley, the organization was effected, and officers elected as follows: Mrs. Sylvanie F.

While music has always found its home here, music of the sweetest and rarest kind, yet it is only lately that a real atmosphere of the scientific study of the art has found its way among us; and now it has progressed so rapidly and so completely that for many of the gayest votaries of society, there is nothing so supremely important as the alternation of lesson and study. Orchestras and quartettes and trios, violins, cornets, violas, violoncellos, mandolins, men and women, boys and girls, enthusiastically push our city forward as one of the great musical centres of the south.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301803">For two months it hasn't rained here, and New Orleans is very warm and thirsty. Her clothes look gray and her linen is yellow from being washed in bad and insufficient water. Her face is breaking out in pimples from drinking and bathing in unaccustomed river water. The big cisterns stand dry and empty and cracked. The heated, stifling air chokes with its blinding, suffocating whirls and eddies of smoke. The sky hangs blue, brightly, dazzlingly blue overhead, and the sun, as he sinks to rest, is buried in clouds of dust vapors, and New Orleans chokes and coughs and gasps, and execrates the Public Works Commissioner.

(Association for the Advancement, of Women) holds its twenty-second congress October 31st, November 1st and 2nd, at Knoxville, Tenn.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301828">The deliberations of this body are always of great importance to women. With Julia Ward Howe as its president, and the representative women of America composing its body, it has grown to be one of the greatest factors of the day in the development. and progress of woman.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301829">The association stands now in an enviable position; it sees its labors crowned with much success, and very little standing in the way of future efforts; it sees--as we all see--the almost boundless possibilities of the American white woman; it sees the especial consideration which she enjoys in this country, anything being possible to her except the act of voting, and her growing influence now almost unlimited.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301830">Realizing, as it must, all this, we want to say a word to the A.A.W. on the responsibility of the white women for the wrongs and outrages done the black race in this country. Most of these have been and are of a nature that little more than a word from a white woman would have effectually stopped numberless acts of annoyance, injustice, and even outrage. Think of the refined, sensitive colored girls who have been literally thrown out of first-class cars in the south without it protest, when a protest would have been so effectual; think of the ambitious, noble-minded women of the south who are shut out from every elevating influence in the shape of lectures, libraries, etc.; think of the lynchings incited by white women, and <hi rend="italic">not one</hi> ever prevented by them.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301831">Policy and expediency are supposed to be unknown to bodies of women in their deliberations, and from this man has raised one of his chief arguments against woman suffrage. In spite of this, it has been one of woman's strong points that she has put right before expediency, and we would suggest to the A. A. W. that they cast aside policy and expediency, and boldly face this race question. It is it question which they can not longer evade. We thoroughly believe that it is the women of America--black and white--who are to solve this race problem, and we do not ignore the duty of the black women in the matter. They must arouse, educate and advance themselves; they are to exert that influence through the homes, the schools and the churches that will build up an intelligent, industrious and moral people. Their duty is plain and must be done. But the white woman has a duty in the matter also; she must see to it that no obstructions are placed in the way of a weak, struggling people; She must no longer consent to be passive. We call upon her to take her stand.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_08.09.02" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">The National Council of Women.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301832">The National Council of Women, which convenes in Washington, D.C., in February, has invited the Colored Women's League of Washington to be represented at the Convention.

A thousand new subscribers--two hundred front each of the cities directly represented in the paper would warrant a larger paper. Only this number in a country where a million women read the paper! We believe our women are loyal; when individually appealed to, they have given us enthusiastic support; but they need to be aroused.

While choosing, Miss Baldwin receives many eloquent letters. It has occurred to us, while reading letters from girls well-endorsed as to character, capability and industriousness, that there might be many families in the north who would be glad to receive in their midst such girls, and who, in exchange for the companionship and services such a girl could give, would give her a good home while going to school.

Just how soon the complete enfranchisement of women will be realized depends largely upon the use we make of our present gains. The false reasoning of the opposition having been overcome, we have now to fight only the prejudices in opposition. When the opposing man sees women actually voting, and looks in vain for the evils predicted, his prejudices will yield and he will gladly join the forces that are fast making for their complete emancipation.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301921">Nothing in the whole social progress of humanity is more interesting and more suggestive of the persistency of rightness than the steady gain of womankind in those larger relationships of human life and civilization, in which the stronger, as well as the gentler virtues, are tending to increase her importance.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301922">Are women ready to assume the of this new recognition of their worth?

If our enfranchisement means only a few more votes added to the republican and democratic sides, respectively, of political issues, there certainly has been no gain for the cause of principle in American politics. If our enfranchisement is to contribute nothing to the corrective forces of independence in American

politics, there will be much disappointment among those who believed that the cause of temperance, municipal reform and better education would be more surely advanced when the finer virtues of women became a part of the political forces of the country.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301925">Our women in Chicago are now, for the first time, getting a taste of politics. By virtue of a recent act of wholesome generosity of our legislators, women are permitted to vote for trustees of the state university. Two women have been duly nominated on the republican and democratic tickets respectively for this office. Fortunately, the nominees are equally meritorious candidates. Although the offices to be filled are purely nonpartisan, our newly fledged suffragists are ranging themselves eagerly in the democratic and republican camps and are campaigning for their respective sides on purely party grounds. So far the campaign speeches and methods have not been elevated in the least degree above the dead level of partisanship. Our own women, too, have gone into the fight with a party zeal that would be satisfactory to the most exacting "boss." Without wishing to discredit the good motives of our women, or to criticise captiously their conduct in the campaign, I believe this new opportunity for self-help and advancement ought, not to be lost sight of in our thirst for public favors, or in our eagerness to help any grand old "party." We ought not to put ourselves in the humiliating position of being loved only for the votes we have. The sincerity of white women, who have heretofore so scorned our ambitions and held themselves aloof from us in all our struggles for advancement, should be, to a degree, questioned. It would be much more to our credit if we would seek, by all possible uses of our franchise, to force these ambitious women candidates and women party managers to relent their cruel opposition to our girls and women in the matter of employment and the enjoyment of civil privileges. We should never forget that the exclusion of colored women and girls from nearly all places of respectable employment is due mostly to the meanness of American women, and in every way that we can check this unkindness by the force of our franchise should be religiously done. If, however, we burden our hearts and minds solely with the anxiety for the success of a party ticket for party reasons, we shall be guilty of the same folly and neglect of self-interest that have made colored men for the past twenty years vote persistently more for the special interests of white men than for the peculiar interests of the colored race.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301926">There is no good reason why our women should not be made to feel sufficiently independent not only to make their peculiar interests a motive in the exercise of the franchise, but also to array themselves, when possible, on the side of the best, whether that best be inside or outside of party lines. Much more ought to be expected of colored women in 1894 in the exercise of their suffrage than was expected of the colored men who first voted under the 15th Amendment.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301927">It is now a good time in woman's clubs and organizations of all kinds for women to prepare themselves, by the best lessons of citizenship, to exert a wholesome influence in the politics of the future. The importance of the suffrage, as a means to complete emancipation from the impositions of prejudice should be eagerly taught, and brought home to the conscience of our women everywhere. It is more than probable that issues of immeasurable importance to the weal of our country, and requiring for their adjustment a larger amount of intelligent patriotism than has yet been exacted from the American conscience, will make demands on us by the time universal suffrage becomes one of the organic laws of the land.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_08.12" type="Article"><head rend="center">COLORADO.</head><docAuthor>Elizabeth Piper Ensley</docAuthor><byline>ELIZABETH PIPER ENSLEY, EDITOR.</byline><head rend="center">What Equal Suffrage has done for Colorado.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301928">Among the many objections met with during our suffrage campaign, were that the best women would not vote, only the bad would exercise the right, and that women would not purify politics.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301929">None of these arguments have proven true. The best women have been the ones most interested. They have formed themselves into different clubs and are the indefatigable workers in the political party with which they affiliate.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301930">During the special canvas for registration it was found that only <hi rend="italic">one</hi> out of twenty immoral women was willing to register.

This call have no effect. The good women are in the majority.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301932">Before the opening, of the present political campaign the Equal Suffrage Association formed a Campaign for Good Government Committee with
<pb xml:id="era1_1301931" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
auxiliaries throughout the state. This committee is composed of six women from each of the four political parties. They were divided into three committees; one, a press committee of sixteen to furnish articles relating to their work for every paper in the state; the other two consist of four members each, one for primaries, the other for conventions. The duty of the former was to urge all women to attend the primaries; that of the latter, to see that important resolutions were introduced into the conventions of all the parties.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301933">The first work of this committee was to draw up resolutions demanding that the age of consent be raised front sixteen to eighteen years, favoring the Initiative and Referendum, so successful in Switzerland, and that, resolving themselves into a committee of the whole, they use every effort to arouse public sentiment to the great need of civil service reform.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301934">These resolutions were passed by the E. S. A., and endorsed by all labor organizations, as well as by the women's clubs.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301935">The first successful result attained in the interest of good government will benefit a large number of people.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301936">Our city charter is a most intricate one. Some of the officials are appointed by the governor, some by the mayor, while others are elected by popular vote. Thus state, and therefore party politics, are brought into our city government.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301937">The present board of public works is composed of men of one party, while the boards of aldermen and supervisors are of two other parties.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301938">According to the charter the board of public works has the authority to employ labor for public improvements.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301939">During the great financial depression, when so many men were out of employment, it was suggested to the board of public works that it much needed sewer be built, thus giving work to hundreds of men having families dependent upon them--especially since three hundred thousand dollars of the city improvement appropriation remained in the bank.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301940">Those men began work late in August, but did not receive a cent, of money due them until the 16th of October, owing to the fact that the supervisors and aldermen refused to allow the warrants tendered the men to be cashed. They declared that the city charter did not sustain the board of public works in the carrying on of public improvements. This, too, in direct defiance of the decision rendered by the courts.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301941">As soon as the campaign for good government committee received an intimation of the existing state of affairs, a committee was appointed to wait upon the board of public works and ascertain the exact truth of the matter. From what the ladies learned, they believed the action to be dictated by a wholly partisan spirit, and therefore to be condemned.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301942">A mass indignation meeting was called. Our largest hall was packed. The women pleaded eloquently for the wronged, and a resolution was adopted providing for the payment of the Delgany Street sewer employees. After that the supervisors readily adopted the resolution. Only the concurrent vote of the aldermen was now needed to enable the treasurer to cash the warrants. A special meeting was called for that purpose at which the resolution was unanimously adopted. When the women crowded around the city clerk to get his approval many of the men to whom the money was due awaited in the lobby. It was a touching sight to witness their joy as they surrounded the women on their way out. They felt that it was all owing to the influence of these good women that their pay was not longer withheld from them.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301943">The women are among the most effective of the campaign speakers. All the political parties have acknowledged their worth and ability by nominating them on the several tickets as representatives to the legislature, superintendent of public instruction, and even as lieutenant governor. An ardent suffragist, whose work during the campaign brought her much in contact with the city officials, says that, in contrasting the deference paid to women now with the indifference then shown, she is constrained to exclaim: "Look here upon this picture, and on this."</p></div><div xml:id="era1_08.13" type="Filler"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">For the Investigation</seg> of Acts of Unlawful Violence.</head><p xml:id="era1_1301944">The Woman's Loyal Union of N.Y. and Brooklyn, are energetically pushing this petition to Congress for the enactment of the Blair Resolution.

It was it period of transitions in language, of religious disturbance, of discontent, among the masses, yet in a low stage of development.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301951">There was, however, a bright side to this dark picture,--a mental activity which was preparing the way for a higher development, not only of the entire German nation, but of all the nations influenced by its civilization; and while Luther was kindling the fires of the reformation by the publication of theses, sermons and tracts, the scholarly Erasmus and Von Hutten were writing, polished satires exposing the abuses of the Church, the vices of the clergy and the greed of monastic orders.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301952">Albert Durer, the greatest German painter of his time, was publishing treatises on art which have stood the test of the centuries; Paracelsus, in the German language, was lecturing on chemistry and medicine; later, Gerhardt and Fleming were writing poems which placed them in the front rank among lyrists.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301953">Dramatic art, encouraged both by Luther and the Jesuists, made considerable progress during the period of the reformation, although the plays were still coarse and offensive at a time when English audiences were appreciating the beauties of Shakespeare's masterpieces.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301954">Maximillian I. interested himself in popular literature to a certain extent, but his tastes inclined him more especially toward the court romances of early medieval days. In the teaching profession the humanists were still overshadowed by the schoolmen, the leading educators of the period, and they (the schoolmen) devoted themselves and their pupils to the most unprofitable questions of metaphysics and theology.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301956">The seven years' course of study, which represented the high aims of the best part of the middle ages, was a noble plan of education, but the church considered no form of knowledge as worthy of recognition which did not directly contribute to its aggrandizement, hence the course had been limited and formalized until only the husk remained. Methods of teaching had been corrupted, memory was substituted for thought. The renaissance, however, which appeared in Europe as the forerunner and a leading cause of the reformation, wrought a change in both subject and method. Pupils were now brought face to face
<pb xml:id="era1_1301955" n="16 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
with Virgil and Horace, Plato and Cicero, and with classic models from all departments of art; but this great intellectual revival was not fully developed in Germany, when that religious movement invaded northern Europe which separated the culture of the reformation from that of the church; and we who are accustomed to look upon Protestantism as the key to independence and originality of thought, as an expression itself of the highest intelligence, can hardly realize the primary results of the separation, the loss in philosophic and artistic culture which the iconoclastic and insurrectionary spirit, attending the reformation in the early years of its development, occasioned in those countries most deeply affected by its onward march.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301957">Those who broke with the church had to create a philosophy, educational forms, and a culture of their own. As the mind, no longer in thraldom, for the church had assumed absolute control of the intellect, began to assert itself, the loss was more than sustained,--by the principles of Bacon, Des Cartes and Kant, by the discoveries of Galileo, Kepler, and Newton, and by the hosts of brilliant thinkers who, in spite of the warfare so long and so bitterly waged between science and religion, did originate and establish a new philosophy, a new education, a new culture.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301958">The instruction which Luther received in the Latin school at Mansfield, in the Francisan school at Madgeburg, the High School of Erfurt and lastly, in the Augustinian convent of Erfurt, was identical with the training of the age; Aristotelian philosophy, classics and theology forming the bulk of the course, and these subjects taught in a narrow and spiritless manner; but with this knowledge as a foundation Luther became the commanding spirit, no less in literature and education than in religion.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301959">The composition or poetry and music was a recreation in which he indulged during moments of leisure, yet who questions whether the soul of a poet ran through the thrilling lines of--</p><lg type="stanza"><l n="1"><hi rend="italic">"Ein feste Burg ist Iunser Gott,</hi></l><l><hi rend="italic">Ein gutes Wehr und Waffen;</hi></l><l><hi rend="italic">Er hilft uns frey ans aller Noth,</hi></l><l><hi rend="italic">Die uns jetzt hat betroffen, etc.</hi></l></lg><p xml:id="era1_1301960">Luther, generally speaking, cared little for the form of his composition as compared with the effect it produced, although his greatest literary achievement, the translation of the Bible into German, was attended by such simplicity of style and perfect comprehension of the numerous German dialects, that for the first time in the history of the Germanic people they possessed a common speech and to this Augustinian monk Germany owes the most essential of all the conditions of a truly national life and literature--a common vehicle of thought, intelligent and commanding.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301961">Education, previous to the reformation as conducted by Luther, was entirely under the control of the church; the church trained its children to fill the ranks of Catholicism, and Lather soon recognized that the success of his religious reforms depended largely upon the organization of schools for the people, in which the principles underlying his position might be taught, and thus popularized; and the study of the mother tongue through the German Bible, which, published in complete form in 1541, represented the work of the best years of his life, accompanied by the singing of those stirring hymns, contributed by Gerhardt, Luther, Fleming and others, was in itself a new education, and created a mutual interest in instruction and religion, in knowledge and faith.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301962">The reformer especially emphasized the value of the primary school, and so influenced the genius of modern education, by the methods which he advocated in that direction, that for three hundred years Protestant nations have moulded universal opinion in matters of primary instruction. He severely criticized the schools of the period, which were mainly designed for the favored few; complains of the brutality of the teachers, who, he says, "Behaved toward their pupils as if they were thieves." According to Luther's testimony, he, himself, was beaten fifteen times in one afternoon.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301963">Aiming at a practical solution of the difficulties surrounding the cause of popular education, in 1524, he addressed a forcible manifesto to the municipal authorities of all the German towns, appealing to the highest considerations of virtue and religion in behalf of public instruction. He would have the state support its schools on the same principle that it supports a standing army; he would make education compulsory, since military service is such, and for the former, the reasons are higher and stronger.</p><p xml:id="era1_1301964">The divorcement of education from the control of the church, and the public work, he found an able assistant in Melanchthon, who was a brilliant humanist, an influential teacher, and a successful writer of school books. Melanchthon's appointment in 1518 as professor of Greek in the University of Wittenberg marks an epoch of German university education. Scholastic methods of teaching were summarily dropped, Wittenberg became the national school, and from this time, the revival of letters, as influenced by the reformation, began to assert itself on German soil.</p></div></div><pb xml:id="era1_1301965" n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_08.15" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era1_1301966"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we181.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 1, Issue 8.

Cheney, who presided, took occasion to call attention to the gross violation of the principles of rights, which are supposed to govern all women's clubs, as exemplified in the action of the Chicago Women's Club in rejecting, a name offered for membership solely on account of color. Miss Willard replied that she was a member of the Chicago Women's Club, but as yet knew nothing about the matter complained of, but if, upon investigation, she finds that her club has, as reported, "rejected an able, refined, highly cultured woman solely on account of her color," then she, Miss Willard, will place her light face beside that darker one and walk out of the club with her.

While Mr. Allen has always maintained the highest standard in his school and has been patronized by the first people of this and other countries, he has never made any sacrifices of principles to do this. From the first he has accepted colored pupils, has brought them into the home department, where they have associated on the closest terms with children of wealth and highest standing. The result has been that his school has prospered, and proved that it is best to do the right thing and the rest will take care of itself.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_09.05" type="Notes"><head rend="center">NEW YORK.</head><docAuthor>Victoria Earle</docAuthor><byline>VICTORIA EARLE, EDITOR.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1302114">Everybody, that was approached directly concerning the November issue of the ERA, was enthusiastic in its praise. "A splendid number!" was echoed and re-echoed. A gentleman of large experience and fairly cultivated mind said, "Really, it is the finest thing in the way of a paper or journal the race has ever put forth, and should meet with instant Success. For my part, I am ready to say that if the women can do such things as that, the men ought to sell out, transfer their books, etc., over to the women, and a great change would come over us.

will subscribe." These things are very encouraging, but "A fair exchange is no robbery." If the masses want a good, clean, wholesome sheet, one that can be fittingly laid where it shall be available to every member of the family, from the youngest to the oldest, can be with pride placed on the circulating files in our libraries, can be offered, as exchanges, with the most favored journals, let them reflect over a few homely facts, that the burden of this venture makes justifiable and necessary.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302115">The women who edit this paper, without a single exception, do their work gratuitously. Because the people admire, but do not subscribe promptly--and in a cold, matter-of-fact, business manner, business principles should govern the subscribing for a paper, just the same as anything else worthy of support--the mental life of our people is not placed in a favorable light by a single strong annalist of today, and the only reason for a certain backwardness is the lack of that kind of support which would naturally lead to the fuller and more perfect development of our literary productions. Owing to the reputation that woman has for talking plain, particularly when there's none to talk hack, I confess I am taking the advantage, but a consciousness steals over me, imparting the thought that the ends sought after will constitute my apology.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302116">Beginning with the January issue, this column will be assisted by a splendid array of talent, among which may be mentioned with pride our sweet-voiced poetess, H. Cordelia Ray, whose gentle, retiring nature has kept her like a sweet little rivulet, ministering to those nearest, and dreading, with ever increasing strength, the gaze of this hurly-burly world of ours; whose one rule of living and judging is, I sometimes think, the one given in our school books for addition and subtraction.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302117">Another gentle woman, whose life is a synonym for the pure and wholesome; in literature, her writings teem with a love for the beautiful, a reverence for the good, and sympathetic encouragement for the struggles of all developing minds, a writer who instinctively lives the theory that while environment has much to do with mind cultivation, yet the individual holds the supreme power. It is the will to do, the will to be, that rules in the realm of mind culture. To know her teaches that there is such a thing as smiling, when a smile will uplift or cheer a fainting companion, even though a sepulchre is hidden deep down within the heart, sacred to the memory of joys of long ago, accounted sorrows now. I speak of her whose writings have long been a pleasure to a large circle here, known to the world as "Petite Reine."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302118">The versatile "Reintals," the grave and experienced "Watchman," and, as time goes on, others will contribute. I speak advisedly, for even now there is it movement on foot to establish a club, or circle of anonymous writers, which shall consist of a few choice spirits who will have as their object the success of real merit, unaided by accidental popularity, etc.--a good move. We can afford to rejoice over such a departure, because too much "noblesse oblige" is likely to sap originality and deferential independence of thought as well as speech.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302119">The Woman's Loyal Union was greatly encouraged by the news contained in last issue, as to the attitude of New England on the Blair Joint Resolution. If every section would take hold as the good New Englanders are doing, a petition would go to congress that would amaze not only ourselves, but the whole country. In the next issue of the ERA we will give a history of the movement from the beginning. Some people are inclined to see nothing practical in this petition the same people saw nothing practical in the petition for an investigation into the slums of large cities, nor the one calling for light as to tenement house construction, and the one which resulted in the exposure of the thousands of petty gambling dives. The results of these investigations have silenced all pessimists concerning them, and we predict the same conclusion when the Blair Joint Resolution shall be enacted and the committee regularly appointed, as was the illustrious Klu Klux Klan committee, before whom all facts concerning mob law shall be laid, and thereby given to the country at large. Then we will all see, as Mr. Blair has said, "The people having the unbiased facts, public opinion will see a remedy and enforce it." We rejoice to know that New England will send an independent petition to Congress. We wish other sections would do likwise, until every part of this great country shall have been heard from. The W. L. U. have in hand now returns from 14 states, and three hundred and fifty names from the Dominion of Canada.</p></div><pb xml:id="era1_1302120" n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era1_09.06" type="Social_Notes"><head rend="center">SOCIAL NEWS.</head><p xml:id="era1_1302121">NEW YORK.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302122">It is now quite decided that Mr. Charles Lansing will lead Miss Kate White to the altar on Christmas day. All society is looking forward to the event with a pleasant flutter of anticipation. It is expected that the affair will be a most elaborate one from every point of view. As the leading lady of Brooklyn, much is expected of her, so far as the wedding gown is concerned. I have it on good authority that it will be simply perfect. As usual, the church will be exquisitely festooned in honor of the Christmas celebration; that of itself will make it an ideal time for a marriage ceremony.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302123">Mr. Lansing owns a number of dwellings, but will take his bride to his homestead, to dwell with his father and mother, and it is said that the preparations going on there for the future mistress are elegant, bordering upon luxury.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302124">Leadership falls now to the winsome--but, oh, so whim-ful--Miss Katie Smith; or that delightful elf, Miss Mena Downing.  Strange how these things go. A little while back, and everything pointed to Miss Evangeline Walker, so far as leadership is concerned, but she is now tremendously interested in experimenting in the housewifely arts. Ah, well, such is life.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302125">Front all outward appearances, this season bids fair to be a most brilliant one, and it would be a delight to contemplate these things but for the decadence of old time manners and customs. Years ago, maidens were not considered stupid or dull who were shy and what some people call prim. They possessed a sweet prudishness that made one really feel that they were made up of tender blossoms and sparkling dewdrops. Oh, they were so bewitchingly dainty, so delightfully "skeery." I remember offering my arm to a delicate little creature once, during a lull in the music, and with the utmost nonchalance piloting her to an obscure corner. Never will I forget the indignant question that sprang into her eyes, as she divined--or thought she did--my meaning. But I came out ahead, as we always do. "Oh," I said, "I fancied I observed a door here leading to--supper!" See the point? The dear girls of today would prefer the quiet tete-a-tete to even the dance. Watch the floor and you'll find more married people dancing than any one else. And now that I come to think of it, that is the secret of the girls knowing how stupid the chappies are. They expect too much of them, because a fellow does not dare talk to more than one in a set--for the other girls will hear every word. It's hard, but the boys all have to play dude, and lisp: "Ah! I weally cawn't say, you know!" "Deah me! I've staid with you quite a twelfth, you know; perfectly ill bred, you know."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302126">It is rumored that Rob's chum, young Jackson, is fairly deluged with "Sunny-side" and "Climax," and the worst of it is, it is charged to poor Anno Domini. Come to think of it, there was something in last issue about the boy "eating his weed," or something like it. It's all in a lifetime.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302127">There's a most amusing story that savors a little of the old time "pig in the bag" series. One of the vestrymen introduced a minister as a lecturer to St. Philips Guild and he spent the hour admitting that Afro-Americans were much in the dark as to the employment of pure air, etc, To say that the house stood aghast, is to say but little.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302128">The Woman's Loyal Union started out to see if women stand by women any better than men do, or to put it more plainly, to see which is the most successful, the ones that depend upon man for a following, or the ones that count upon women first, last and always. I think the latter came in losers. I don't know for sure. At any rate, the W. L. U. gave an entertainment, and, while the most exclusive of New York and Brooklyn society life patronized the affair, yet there was room for many more.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302129">The hall was beautifully decorated with flags and potted plants, palms and fresh-cut chrysanthemums being most noticeable. Counsellor Stuart, in his usual hearty, brilliant manner, said a great many bright and sound things on that occasion that New Yorkers ought to remember. "These, women are aiming to accomplish a splendid work, a practical work--one that deserves the individual support of every man and woman anxious for genuine race development. The measure they are working for has within its scope the refutation of the vile slanders against its as a humane moral people."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302130">The Hon. John S. Durham followed, and made a strong point by asking, "Will the people sympathize with so grave an undertaking?" He complimented the women by saying their methods appealed to reason, and not sentiment mainly, and were bound to succeed in the end."</p><pb xml:id="era1_1302131" n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era1_1302132">The leader of this courageous body, the sad-eyed "Victoria Earle," was called "Anno Domini, '94," in my presence, too. Thanks awfully for the compliment. Speaking of the president of the powerful W. L. U., several have noticed that she wears invariably a pair of hearts at her throat, and a tiny blue one on the index finger of the left hand. I wonder why.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302133">As usual, Harry Burleigh was the lion of the occasion. He sang, in the absence of a member, with the Guild Quartette, and later charmed the house with two of his favorite numbers. And while such as "our Rob and his chums," Messrs. Attwell, Day, Peterson, Charleton, Durham, Grazette, Thomas, and such old veterans as W. Russell Johnson, Tom McKeel, Dorsey Webster, and a whole host were dancing, Harry B. was chatting with one of the sweetest girls in the lot--and there were so many lovely creatures out that night! One, a very interesting looking widow, was the cynosure of all eyes.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302134">Mrs. Matthews, our "Victoria Earle," upon whom I shall, in all probability, make an ERA New Year's call, possibly confess, etc., etc., has the reputation of being one of the most enthusiastic women in town, earnest, and to a remarkable degree, a believer in her own sex, and a woman destined to succeed in what she sets out to do. She's a credit to her sex, and the Queen Bee in our town. She has stirred our best women as no other woman has done, in my time, at least. It was a fitting compliment to her as a woman that such women as Mrs. S. J. S. Garnet, Mrs. C. A. Attwell, Mrs. F. H. Carmand, Mrs. J. Pegram Williams, Mrs. Jerome B. Peterson, Miss Annie L. Dias, Mrs. E. Dorsey, Mrs. Broughton, Miss Edie Braxton, Miss Katie White, Mrs. A. D. Lee, Mrs. Beauvere, Mrs. Richards, Mrs. Jarrot, Mrs. J. E. Garner, Mrs. J. S. Poline, Mrs. Maxwell and Mrs. A. Rich gathered around her.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302135">The King's Daughter's "Willing Workers" Circle, Mrs. White, president, are practising a drama, to be given some time before Easter. To this circle belongs the honor, I understand, of placing the first colored woman in the management of Brooklyn Colored Home. Mrs. Anna Rich, a sister of "Victoria Earle."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302136">The St. Mark boys are planning a great surprise for the Guild lads. They are secretly drilling a quartette to throw into the shade Messrs. Attwell, Jackson, Williams and Medocer.

F. Hilyer, one of the most useful and popular citizens with whom Washington is blessed, has been called from Provident Hospital, Chicago, to take charge of the nurses in the surgical department of Freedman's Hospital.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302139">Musical Washington now carols paeans of rejoicing  because Mrs. Alice Strange Davis has returned to her former home and has again taken up her residence among us. Baltimore has our heartfelt sympathy at the loss of such an artist as Mrs. Davis.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302140">The social festivities of the season were inaugurated by a reception recently given by Mrs. A. F. Hilyer, whose assistants were Mesdames Lawson, Davis, Williams, Terrell, and Misses Mickie Cook, Bessie Cook, Essie Tucker and Annie Wilder. The costumes of the ladies, the delicacies served by such charming young women, and the amiability of the hostess, all went to make the occasion enjoyable in the extreme.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302142">About thirty young women are availing themselves of a course in nursing which Freedman's Hospital now offers. They are obliged to remain in the hospital eighteen months before receiving a diploma. Two hours a day they are off duty and about once in two weeks have a whole afternoon to themselves. Besides enjoying the benefit received from actual experience in nursing the sick, they are permitted to assist at the clinics, where much valuable information is acquired. In addition to giving instruction free of charge, the authorities pay the nurses a small sum monthly for their services. With such an opportunity and with such encouragement, it is no wonder that so many of our women are choosing the avocation for which they are by nature so admirably fitted. In deciding to become a professional nurse a young

woman not only selects a calling which is both dignified and lucrative, but one which calls forth all those virtues essential to the highest and best womanhood.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302143">"Why do the Washington schoolmarms look so young?" asked a gentleman from a neighboring city not many moons ago. It would have been impossible to reply had a suitable answer been on the tongue's end. Without waiting for any solution of this interesting problem in ethnological physiognomy, our friend went into one series of paroxysms after another over the youthful appearance, the charming manners, the amiable disposition and the fetching costumes of the typical Washington schoolmarm. He insisted that the older they grow, the younger and more charming they become, and he was a man of good judgment and excellent taste.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302144">When it was possible to get a word in edgewise, a thoughtful friend, noted for his penetration, ventured to solve the mystery of our schoolmarm's eternal youth and beauty as follows: "Our teacher's work is lighter than anywhere else in the country, thanks to our school system, which is about as near perfection as a human institution can hope to be. Outside the schoolroom the teacher is not overburdened with work, although nowhere in the country are teachers more solicitous for their pupils' welfare and more punctilious about their duties to them. The Washington schoolmarm is not harassed by the divers vexations of spirit to which many of her unfortunate sisters are elsewhere subjected. For instance, her position in the schools is secure as long as she deports herself properly, and she knows it. She is, therefore, not obliged to pull wires and 'crook the pregnant hinges of the knee' to retain it, a rule which, I regret to state, does not pertain everywhere. When there is the inclination, she can attend a lecture, hear an opera, go to the theatre, or divert herself in the variety of ways for which the Nation's Capital is famous. Besides, our teachers are well paid; can, therefore, afford to take good care of themselves and dress well. No wonder we have the most charming schoolmarms in the world," said their able champion and logician. Drawing himself up with pride and glowing with enthusiasm, as though he were individually responsible for the delightful condition of affairs on which he had expatiated with such evident satisfaction and knowledge.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302145">The Colorado women came nobly to the rescue of the republican party in the last election. This is a fair sample of what women will do for the country when they are no longer put on the level with idiots and criminals. Wyoming and Colorado are the only states advanced, and just enough to permit all of her citizens to vote at state elections without regard to sex.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302146">It is safe to predict that a few years hence it will be difficult for colored women to find employment here as cooks or housekeepers. Public sentiment is waxing so strong against them that unless a change sets in their favor, comparatively few will be able in the future to find employment as servants. A glance at the advertising columns of the daily papers, in which the demand for white help is so explicit and great, is sufficient to convince one that the situation here for women laborers of the race is becoming very serious. It is the fad now for the wealthier classes to employ skilled cooks, to whom they pay large prices, and these skilled cooks are almost without exception white. In the south, where colored help has always been preferred, even when white help was just as available and serviceable, it is growing quite common to employ white servants to the exclusion of the colored.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302147">There is constant friction between the employed and the employer all over the country and along all lines, regardless of race or sex, but the loudest complaint here at present is directed against colored domestics. This is one of the most, serious problems that confronts us, since the women wage-earners of the race contribute as much at least to its support as the men, and when the women fail to find employment in domestic service many a family will suffer and much of the revenue enjoyed will be cut off.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302149">In view of the fact that white help is supplanting the colored, is it not sensible and charitable for the thoughtful men and women of the race to attempt to devise ways and means of improving this alarming condition of affairs? Since clubs and societies are formed to further all sorts of interests and projects, why not organize a society, the duty of whose members will be to meet the laboring classes, and impress upon them the necessity of making themselves skilled workmen in every sense of the word? There is a society here, headed by Mrs. Logan and other prominent women, whose object is the improvement of do-

mestics. They teach the girls and women bow to perform their duties skilfully and systematically, so as to lighten their labor and make their services more desirable and indispensable to those who employ them. Is it not possible for the thinking women among us to establish schools in which our girls may be educated to be first-class servants? It is a work in which those who have the welfare of the laboring classes at heart must soon engage. Obliged to combat a bitter, unreasonable prejudice, the working colored women of the future must be well equipped and reliable indeed to stem the tide of disfavor which has set against them, here at least.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302150">"What are you doing with yourself these days?" asked one well-known woman of another. "Well, I'm taking a course in English literature and dabbling a little into the history of Russia. Since the death of the czar has turned the attention of the world to his interesting country, it has suddenly dawned upon me that I am absolutely ignorant of its present government, the habits of its people, and its past history." "Taking a course in English literature and studying Russian history!" exclaimed her friend in amazement. "What becomes of your house, your children and your sewing? I've neither chick nor child, and I haven't one minute to spare after the monotonous household affairs have been dispatched. From morning till night I am equipped with a kitchen utensil, a broom or a dust-cloth, and if, by some lucky chance, I can conscientiously lay them aside, in comes a friend or an acquaintance, and away go plans and time for mental improvement. I am just like everyone else and find it impossible to get good help, so that I have about as much time to study when I do my own work as I do when I have a hindering assistant. There is no one in the house except my husband and myself, the work is light, but by the time the little things have been attended to I am either too tired or too worried to study. Now you have a house full of children, do most of your sewing, and are a perfect model of a housekeeper, with no better help than I have. How in the world do you find time for English literature and Russian history?</p><p xml:id="era1_1302151">"How I manage to save a few minutes for mental improvement is not difficult to explain," replied the friend. "I have a certain time in which to do my various duties. In other words, I systematize my work, for in the long run it is much more satisfactory to map out a schedule of work and go by it, though the heavens fall, than to attack things 'a la haphazard.' It may secin a. little like self-imposed servitude and self-tyranny at first, but the good results soon justify its adoption. Just try a schedule once, and then revert to the old go-as-you-please method of doing a duty today, if you feel like it, leaving it alone if you don't, consuming one hour to accomplish something today which will require three hours tomorrow, and thus getting yourself wound up in a knot of unfinished duties tangled with those that are to come, and you will soon see the folly of this desultory, slip-shod way of doing business. But you asked me how I found time to meddle with the affairs of the Russians and attend to my own business as well. I simply arrange my work so as to leave a certain amount of time for study, and whether I feel like it or not I go at it religiously, unless I am positively ill."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302152">"What do you do if you are interrupted by visitors? " "That is the most serious difficulty which confronts me and the only kind of interruption against which I can make no provision. In the first place, I usually set apart for study that time in the morning or afternoon when visitors rarely come, but if they do I accept the inevitable and promise to make up for lost time as soon as possible."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302153">"By the way, did you ever think how much time would be saved if we did not run in upon our friends at all sorts of unseasonable hours, just because it suited our convenience? Men will not entertain callers in business hours. If a friend comes in whom they are really glad to see, they greet him cordially, pass the time of day, and excuse themselves on the plea of pressing business matters. No offence is meant and none is taken. What a blessing it would be if we women could understand each other so thoroughly. So often have I heard my friends bemoaning their fate, because the day set apart for doing some special work was hopelessly destroyed by unreasonable though not unwelcome visitors."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302155">"Don't you enjoy the visits of your friends?" asked her companion, considerably piqued and disconcerted by the conversation on unreasonable visits. "Certainly I do," was the reply. "No one enjoys visiting and being visited by friends more than I do; I only plead for seasonable visits and a little insight or tact to discern when it is right to consume a friend's time and when it is kind to leave her alone. Personally, I have noth-

It was Reed who was selected to go to California and bring back a noted desperado, in which case he showed it great deal of intrepidity and bravery.  It was Reed who came to arrest Big Dick, but the latter took him and carried him to the Court House, much to his mortification, at the same time surrendering himself. Reed, however, in his later years, has been heard to refer good-naturedly to this episode.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302157">It, was generally conceded that whatever he set out to do was generally done, even to the capture of a poor fugitive slave. It has been said, however, by those who knew him best, that he was not prejudiced against the colored people, and that, under the same circumstances, he would capture a white man equally as quick.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302158">But it was an attempt on his part to capture one of the former that we are about to relate.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302159">On the very spot where the Twelfth Baptist Church now stands, and the adjacent territory, extending in a northeasterly direction and bounded on three sides by the rear walls of brick houses, was a settlement consisting of dingy, shabby looking houses, most of which were known as "ten-footers," that were scattered promiscuously over the entire area. There was no recognized passage through this region, but a way known as "Black Dog Alley " (a name given it on account of the numerous curs, in reality of all colors, that infested the place, and by which the stranger, whom they seemed to instinctively know, was sure to be beset upon entrance and determinedly followed till his return and exit), which windings were understood only by those familiar with the locality, was the sole avenue. Neither was this habitation lighted by night, and one having occasion to be within its borders after nightfall might imagine himself in some part of Pluto's dark realm. In fact, the whole appearance of the place was as uninviting as it was irregular, and one in which people generally never cared to venture too far, either by day or night.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302160">It was in one of those dark, sunburnt-looking hovels that the incident occurred to which we are about to allude.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302161">It seemed to be suspected by Reed's movements that he was after a fugitive slave who had come to Boston and was known to be stopping somewhere in that part of the West End to which reference has been made; and their surmises proved to be well founded, for the fugitive had been tracked to Boston, and it was given into Reed's hands to find and arrest him. He seemed to have been successful in gaining a knowledge of his whereabouts and no doubt thought he was sure of securing his victim.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302163">One day that officer appeared before one of those hovels before described and demanded admission. But a voice from within demanded the immediate withdrawal of the officer, as he could rest assured that the door would not be opened. This only incensed the latter, who threatened to burst open the door if his demand was not immediately complied with; but in turn was warned by the same voice that if his threat was carried out he would be sure to regret it. This only increased the anger of the intruding officer, who, sure enough, commenced to use his legs and feet as battering rams, and being stout and rugged it was not long before the wood-work around the lock began to weaken, and soon breaking away, the door swung upon its hinges, and Reed started to enter, but suddenly halted, for before him stood a ferocious-looking colored man armed with an ax, which he poised in his hands, who, in fierce tones told the officer that if he stepped his foot inside the door his head would be severed from his body. As we have said, Reed hesitated , for the look of unmistakable meaning in the eyes of the colored man seemed to bring him to his senses and to a realizing sense of the situation. He felt in his heart that there was danger, but he had come there to arrest a fugitive slave that had there found a shelter, and yet he shrank from the undertaking. But should he retreat? It was no doubt when this thought came to his mind that Reed's courage and determination came back. Such a thing should never be said, for if so, his reputation was gone forever. And seeming either to determine within himself that he would not believe that the man would dare after all to carry out his threat, or that he might successfully cope with him (for Reed was no coward), he made a move-
<pb xml:id="era1_1302162" n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ment to take the forbidden step. But if this was his reasoning, and such it evidently seemed to be, it proved a poor reed to lean upon; for, quick as lightning, the ax was swung aloft, flashed as it turned in air, and came down. The head was gone; but not by decapitation, for Reed saw the movement and dodged quick enough to save his head and his life also. But he was not to go unscathed, for the keen blade of the ax struck the fleshy part of the arm near the shoulder, which he had raised for protection, inflicting a severe flesh wound, and found a lodgment in the frame of the door. As quick as before, the ax was again uplifted, as if this time to make sure his aim. But Reed had had enough of such experience, and with a quickness for which he had never been accredited, he had eluded the descending blow and was well outside of the door, and standing at a respectful distance began to vow vengeance on his would be headsman; he finally went away declaring that he would return and arrest them both. In due time, a warrant was indeed served upon the colored man who, now that the fugitive had made his escape (who, while the scene at the door was being enacted, had, with the aid of the defender's wife got out of the house by a back window and been conducted to a place of safety) readily and without resistance gave himself up, and the next morning was arraigned before the court. But upon examination it was found that Reed had unlawfully proceeded without a warrant, and the Judge, taking the ground that a man's house was his castle and that the colored man was justified in doing as he did under the circumstances, and considering, perhaps, that Reed needed a lesson on the unlawful exercise of authority, the man was acquitted.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302164">The circumstances and trial of this case were published in the Boston newspapers and are still remembered by a number among us. One old gentleman, doing business in Boston some years ago, told the writer that he knew of the affair soon after its occurrence, and distinctly remembers reading the account of the trial in his paper, <title>The Times</title>, the next day.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_09.08.02" type="Article"><head rend="center">From the Virginia Baptist.</head><p xml:id="era1_1302165">We have received the enlarged edition of the WOMAN'S ERA, a monthly published at Boston, Mass., with Josephine St. P.

The old house on Essex street, in which Wendell Phillips lived for forty years, has succumbed to the business demands of the city, and that the associations connected with the Spot might not wholly be forgotten, and as a memorial to Boston's famous son and great orator, a tablet to the memory of Wendell Phillips was placed upon the building, with fitting exercises, on Nov. 20.

No other class of venders say who shall and shall not buy their wares. A real estate agent advertises for a purchaser, does not intimate that anything is necessary but the requisite amount of cash and then reserves to himself the right to refuse and perhaps insult a colored man if he chance to apply. However, people get what they want, a fact which sellers of houses will begin to realize by-and-by; in the meantime, don't let them in their blind anger put things in a wrong light. A Christian and a gentleman, a Harvard graduate and instructor can do such a thing as sell a house to colored people without any loss to honor or discredit to their standing.

His own efforts toward the materialization of ideals rapidly gained the attention of the public, but the interruption occasioned by the Thirty Years' War, his own death in 1546, and other events before and after, incident to the Reformation, made it impossible for him to directly impress his personality upon the schools of his time.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302193">Luther, Melanchthon and Erasmus formulated theories for Protestant education, while others, as the brilliant Sturm of Strasburg, put them to practical use.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302194">Living between the years 1550 and 1589, all enthusiastic humanist, Sturm's work was especially along the line of higher education. In his course of ten, or at the least, nine years, seven were to be spent in acquiring pure idiomatic Latin, and the remainder in the acquisition of an elegant Latin style. As rector of the Strasburg high school for a period of forty-five years, during which time thousands of pupils passed under his instruction, and from nearly every European country, he, more than Luther or Melanchthon, moulded the form of Protestant schools, directed the educational thought of the times, and developed the scheme upon which the great classical schools of England and other Protestant countries were based. Thus it was that Cicero to such an extent moulded the character and conduct of an English statesman, who felt that "A false quantity in a Latin quotation was really a greater crime than a slip in logical argument."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302195">Erasmus, the scholar of the Reformation, exerted a most salutory effect upon the educational spirit of the age by calling the attention of teachers to the amenities of polite society, and to attractive methods of producing culture in the pupil.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302196">Take in its entirely, humanism, as taught in the Protestant schools, if narrow, was not a poor equipment for active life.

If there are but two great elements in our modern civilization, Hebraism and Hellenism, it is safe to state that the Reformation has indelibly stamped the general principles of the former upon our educational systems; while the whole tendency of modern civilization toward Hellenism is so overmastering that there is little danger of its being over-shadowed.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302199">Neither can the influence of the early Protestant schools be accurately estimated without sounding the depths of that great counter-current, which was rapidly thrown into prominence and used by the opponents of the reform measures to serve the double purpose of stemming the tide of the Revolution, either by the conquest of new provinces for the church, through missions, or by preserving the old through the control of the church.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302200">Organized by Loyola, the Society of Jesus was formally consecrated by Paul IV. in 1540, and grew with such rapidity that by 1710, the Jesuits controlled 612 colleges and it large number of universities. Upon its roll of honor were found some of the most illustrious names of the period--Bossuet, Des Cartes and Moliere. Voltaire received his training from the Jesuits, but he says of them, "They taught me nothing but Latin and nonsense."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302201">Authorities differ as to the educational value of the Jesuit schools. Bacon and Des Cartes sincerely believed in their superiority. Leibuitz regarded them as below mediocrity, but in spite of adverse opinion, they maintained an educational supremacy until the end of the eighteenth century, and according to the Brittanica, represent in America today a large percentage of the whole number of educational institutions, both in the United States and Canada.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302202">Unlike the Protestant reformers, the Jesuits ignored primary instruction, and thus far no exposition of the principles underlying their method of instruction have been found. Like the humanists, and to a still greater extent, they reverenced the study of Latin, and covered their districts with Latin schools. They appealed to the memory as the basis upon which to found their system; and the sole merit of their teachers, as seen through the experience of the centuries, seems to have been the stamp of aestheticism which they fixed upon modern education and their ingenious attempts, for whatever purpose, to individualize their pupils. In our own system, we have not yet decided whether it is better to turn out job-lot mediocrity or to individualize or specialize.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302203">The Jansenists, rivals of the Jesuits, possessed whatever of merit there may have been in the latter, and, in addition, sought to introduce the study of the mother tongue, the training of the reason and judgment. Looked upon with disfavor, their schools were soon suppressed by the Jesuits; but the contest for supremacy, which, from the initial point, began to be waged in those countries where Catholicism and Protestantism co-exist, still continues, assuming various phases, according to the political and religious character of the country in question, and universally affecting civilization to a far greater extent than can be estimated by the casual observer.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302204">Thus has the humanistic system of Protestant education, as originated by Luther, been limited in extent, and otherwise changed by the influence of the streams that have impregnated it. Humanism itself, training the pupil more especially for school than for life, gradually gave place to that realism and naturalism that necessarily follow in the wake of utilitarian ideas and today form the most important features of our educational system.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302205">Naturalism in Germany was ably fostered by Ratich and Comenius, and both were largely influenced by the Lutheran movement. Ratich defined a few valuable pedagogical laws and endeavored to establish the mother tongue as a part of the curriculum; but it was Comenius who determined that gradation of schools which forms the basis of modern instruction, who not only defined laws in the art of teaching which are still in use, but also substituted the knowledge of things for the study of Greek and Latin roots, and thus produced a race of original investigators. The mother-school of Comenius prepared the way for Frbel and the kindergarten, while from his plan of nature study, we develop the science lessons of primary and elementary schools. Thus at every step we find modern education linked with the genius of the Reformation.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302207">Compayre writes in his "History of Pedagogy," "Every system of philosophy contains in germ a special system of education." Yes, and it is no less true that the destiny of the human race is controlled by educational forces extending backward to the creation of the universe, onward

and onward in ever-widening circles, through unknown evolutions, into infinity. Environed today more closely by the philosophic circles of Bacon, Des Cartes and Kant than by the principles of Luther's methods, we feel the force of at greater scope of horizon and call it the "new education," but the unprejudiced mind will freely admit that its data were made possible of conception, of interpretation, of realization because of that spirit of absolute intellectual freedom which the processes of the Reformation contributed to modern civilization.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302208">Volume I., No. 8, of the WOMAN'S ERA has reached our office.

The continually recurring cry, "I have not the time," which besets us at every fresh allusion to any plan, is raised, if you will notice, by those who have the least to do, for should you visit their homes you will often find them sitting for hours with idle hands folded in their laps.

Very few little people will realize or will believe that the soul "knows its haunts no more." No, they think, not clearly and concisely, nor perhaps knowing what it is they do think, that somehow, someway they will return. As a little one expressed it, "All the men that died in the war, they comed back and be'd other people;" and no amount of coaxing or threatening or cross-questioning could make her say aught of her idea save that "she always thought so."

It has been in existence for three years. It is composed of about thirty young women and girls who meet for real earnest study.

Two comfortable parlors are rented for the use of the girls and evening classes are held.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302231">There is instruction given in the English branches, bookkeeping, German and literature. This winter a class in current topics has been started. The girls are encouraged to talk land ask questions about events of interest that are going on all the time.

Great interest is shown in this class and the girls eagerly listen and show an intelligent appreciation of their leader's efforts to interest them in the best of current news.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302232">An interesting sermon, book, or magazine article often furnishes the topic. Miss M. G. Jones last winter conducted a successful course in literature. Dr. Rebecca Cole has taught the German class for two years. The services of the teachers are gratuitous, thus making it possible for the club to pay the rent and buy necessary books at a comparatively small cost to each member. This is the kind of work that helps make our women ready for the opportunities that are opening for them. This is the "woman's century," it is said, and although colored women come last in the American scheme of life, it behooves the girls of our race to equip themselves so as to act their parts worthily.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302234">In lighter vein we turn to listen to the joy bells ringing for the marriage of a sweet Philadelphia

Bishop Coleman, of Delaware, was at St. Thomas' Church when these papers were read, and he considered them of such special excellence that he proposed that the ladies be sent to Hartford to read their contributions there.

It was the rare privilege of herself and her late estimable husband to have furnished home and shelter and succor to the indomitable hero whenever he was in Chicago.

He was without honor or any of the trappings of greatness, yet to understand and fully know the significance of that homely name requires the perspective of a century of history and a study of all the open and secret forces of American civilization. The soul of John Brown was the magnet that drew all the forces of opposing interests to the stupendous crisis of 1861.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302254">It is Emerson who says that God offers to each mind the choice between repose and truth. If your choice is repose then you are satisfied with the first religious creed, the first philosophy or the first politics that comes your way. Your pleasures and griefs are all conventional. To be comfortable and let alone is the motive of your life. The great demands of truth, of liberty and justice annoy you. You stand for the dead weight of inertia in all human progress. On the other hand, you who desire truth from the free and bountiful hand of the Almighty become a part of the dynamics of progress in humanity. Truth means restlessness and an uncompromising hate of wrong. It means reformation and the force of virtue in human affairs. He who chooses truth as a life motive is always and at all places a candidate for truth at whatever cost.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302255">To such an one nothing is sacred or holy that is not illumined by the pure white light of truth.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302256">The sum total of all our religion and our faith in God and man and government is our unyielding loyalty to all revelations of truth.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302257">The supremacy in human history of such names as Savanarola, Luther, Cromwell, Washington and Lincoln are but so many evidences of truth exalted in human character.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302258">It was the heroic Search to realize his own conception of truth that guided Columbus through mists of doubt and the perils or untried waters to the blessed haven of it new continent.

While his contemporaries became eminent in literature, statesmanship and oratory, John Brown was still a man of the woods and unknown and unheeded. He literally walked through these states of the Union seeing many things and pondering them in his heart. He saw the glory of his country reflected from the majesty of its mountains and from the peace and beauty of its valleys. He communed with the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and felt proud of them all its a part of the heritage of freedom. But, alas! there was to all of his senses a discordant element. There was a shadow of evil over all that was fair and bright and promising. He saw his countrymen everywhere serving the cause of liberty with one hand and the cause of oppression with the other. Everywhere he heard his countrymen exulting in liberty, yet justifying bondage. He heard the statesman of his day equally eloquent on the theme of the Declaration of Independence and the codes of slavery. He saw the arrogant power of slavery defying all that was hallowed in religion, precious in democracy, and authoritative in law. He saw the nation's supreme oracle of justice sink to the lowest depths of injustice in the Dred Scot decision. His soul was heavy with grief because of the unutterable shame of his country as written in the fugitive slave law. He saw the Missouri Compromise swept away by the same fiendish spirit of Slavery. In fact, he saw freedom as a progressive force in the republic "banished to brutish beasts," and the opposite of all that was nobly fought for and nobly writ in law and the nation's heart aggressive, ascendant and triumphant. But what could John Brown do to stay this full tide of evil? Was he not poor, uneducated and unrelated to the men and women of power, and far removed from the forces that make and unmake governments?</p><p xml:id="era1_1302262">And then again were not such men as Whittier, Phillips, Douglass, Garrison and Sumner doing all that was possible to be done? Everywhere the righteous were praying for abolition, and was it not written by the hand of God that the power of the righteous always prevailed?</p><p xml:id="era1_1302263">John Brown may have asked himself all of these questions, but to every such question was the answer--Courage! He felt the exulted precept of Phillips, that in the cause of right the terms minority and majority were meaningless. He did not deprecate the gentle forces of prayer, eloquence and literature that were so powerfully arrayed against slavery, yet he saw that all these things were like casting pearls before swine in their inefficiency to overthrow the power of slavery. With marvellous insight John Brown saw that American slavery in its violent subversion of all laws and rights, and in its aggressive sovereignty over all the forces of government, was nothing less than a state of open war against the Union.</p><pb xml:id="era1_1302264" n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA"/><p xml:id="era1_1302265">If the American people could but see this and feel this as he did, the path of duty would be easy.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302266">The need of the hour was not the spirit of peace and conciliation, but rather the spirit militant to dare and do the bloody work of war.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302267">"To arms, to arms," for the rescue of American liberty, was the one call needed as a fitting challenge to the leagured forces of oppression. It is to the undying glory of John Brown that he gave this first alarm and with superlative heroism first led the forces of warfare in Kansas and Virginia against the invasions or slavery. With the military eye of a great general John Brown saw that Kansas was the picket-line of freedom. The fell purpose of slavery, to trample into the dust the letter and spirit of the Missouri Compromise, and to invade the virgin soil of liberty and to extend its foul conquest over every inch of territory in the Northwest covered by the American flag, was to John Brown and his followers the very culmination of treasonable aggression against the republic. Who now could hesitate to unsheath the sword of war? Alas, for the cause of freedom! Alas, for the prophecies of Plymouth Rock and of '76 if now, in its hour or peril on the free soil of Kansas, liberty could find no champion to flash the sword of resistance against the dire encroachments of the slave power I will not attempt to retell the oft repeated stories of the eventful tragedies enacted oil the soil of Kansas. If you were not a part of it, or have never read it, you have missed one of the most instructive and dramatic chapters of American history. Here was the storm-center of the nation's first alarm. In the history of it all John Brown's righteous soul breathes in every chapter. Take the name of John Brown out of the history of "Bloody Kansas" and the grand meaning of it all shrinks into a mere guerilla warfare. John Brown's warfare for loyalty and freedom in Kansas was a profound object-lesson for all America. It furnished to all christendom in a most dramatic way the dire meaning of American slavery. It brought into startling contrast the two civilizations of America and bondage under the name of Union. What an awful absurdity was this from 1856 to 1859! How all history now rings with praises to John Brown for <choice><sic>empasizing</sic><corr>emphasizing</corr></choice> that absurdity in Kansas and Virginia.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302268">Men of great piety and unerring grasp of the deeper meaning of things begin now to speak more and more confidently of the suggestive kinship between Calvary and the hills of Virginia. Can the souls of men be freed by a single death? Can the limbs of man be unchained and his soul take the wings of liberty by a single death? Call the great universe of mankind catch glimpses of immortality in the hallowed glow of all that is pure, beautiful and good, in a single death? Thanks to the human soul and its capacity for infinite goodness, Calvary and Virginia can give an answering "yes" to these exalted questionings of the human heart.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_09.15" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">COLORADO.</head><docAuthor>Elizabeth Piper Ensley</docAuthor><byline>ELIZABETH PIPER ENSLEY, EDITOR.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1302269"><hi rend="bold">Election Day.</hi></p><p xml:id="era1_1302270">Then, it ever, came perfect day.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302271">The clear atmosphere brought the mountains into bold relief.

Women of all parties took an active part, but the Republican women seemed rather the most enthusiastic. They were most systematically organized and had worked the field thoroughly. All voted, those who had protested against having the ballot thrust upon them and those who had hitherto taken no interest in politics. They electioneered, they drove from house to house bringing voters to the polls.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302278">The women generally followed the instructions of the party leaders and voted the prepared slate, through fear of losing their votes if they scratched their tickets. The credulity of woman was played upon to the utmost. It is known, however, that some women were independent enough not to mark the party emblem.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302279">The Republicans were triumphant; they won by a handsome majority. In Arapahoe county no other party could claim anything. This was probably due to the determination to defeat Gov. Waite, against whom there is a strong sentiment, not only among the opposing factious, but in his own party. Voters from all ranks were induced to join the Republicans in order to elect Mr. McIntire over Gov. Waite.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302280">Lessons learned from the election and campaign preceding it:</p><p xml:id="era1_1302282">1. Women will study politics. Proven by the great number of political study clubs formed during the past year. A populist woman, who stumped the state, says, "Politics was the theme of discussion morning, noon and night. The women talked politics over their sewing, their dish-washing, and during their social calls. Politics has made them read and think more, and in new and different lines. Some of the women are getting these economic questions drilled into their heads in a way that would astonish you, and when the mothers understand these things it is going to make a

vast difference, for they will teach them to the children."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302283">2. Women will vote. The women of Colorado have demonstrated that conclusively.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302284">3. They will generally vote straight. This fact was shown by the Republican women, though it may be that in this instance they believed it necessary to do so in the interest of law and order.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302285">4. There should be thorough and systematic organization of the women of all parties.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302286">The good government committee will now take steps to strengthen its force and organize more thoroughly for the municipal election in the spring.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302287">The first important work of the women will be to see that the party emblem in the Australian ballot is done away with, thus insuring a truly secret ballot, find therefore more independent voting.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302288">The readers of the ERA will be interested to know what special part the colored women have taken in the election. Most of them have done admirable work in the interest of the Republican party. They also formed clubs of their own and heroically helped their brothers to elect a representative to the legislature, although the majority of those brothers voted against woman's enfranchisement.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302289">They made good campaign speeches.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302290">Mrs. Olden is deserving of especial mention. She was one of fourteen delegates sent from the colored Republican club to the county convention held last summer. She suggested that they ask for representation in the state convention, but was discouraged by her too-timid brothers, on the ground that there was no use asking for what they would not get. But this courageous little woman persisted. The outcome of it all was that Mrs. Olden was unanimously elected third Vice-President of the Republican State League of Colorado. She has done most excellent work for the party.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302291">Mrs. Olden is a graduate of Fisk University. On the eve of election in November, '93, she came to Denver from Tennessee at the head of a small colony of people who longed for the free air of the mountains. They sought a dwelling place where free speech would not be denied them.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302292">The colored women of Denver have recognized the worth of Mrs. Olden by making her president of their league lately organized, and about which I will tell you later.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_09.16" type="Paper"><head rend="center">THE COLLEGE SETTLEMENTS.</head><docAuthor>Ella Lavinia Smith</docAuthor><byline>ELLA LAVINIA SMITH.</byline><p xml:id="era1_1302293" rend="center">Paper No. 3.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302294">Other American Settlements include the one in Philadelphia opened in April, 1892, in connection with work already begun by the St. Mary Street Library Association; Denison House, Boston, opened Jan. 1, 1893; Andover House, Boston, opened in fall, 1892; the Neighborhood Guild, founded by Dr. Stanton Coit in New York City, and opened in 1887; the University Settlement in Philadelphia, opened in Jan., 1893; East Side House, New York, opened early in 1891; the Epworth League Settlement, Boston, founded in 1892, and Hull House, Chicago, opened in Sept., 1889.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302295">Of the Philadelphia Settlement Miss Hannah Fox said, in the Third Annual Report of the College Settlement Association, "The situation offered differed from the New York situation, in being off a side street in a shiftless neighborhood, among a less provident class of people, most of them being colored. ... The comfort of the house is greatly enhanced by the Starr Garden, which adjoins it. This garden is now owned by the City Park Association, and is opened daily under the care of a guardian, for the free use of the people, and is always placed at our disposal. ... There is an admission fee to all classes where anything like a trade is taught, as it is not felt advisable to give, all things involving a sacrifice being more truly valued. What the young boys and girls in the St. Mary's street neighborhood need most of all is work--good, steady, intelligent work. It is not lack of money which is the poverty we most deplore, but lack of self-hood, that self-hood which comes from work and makes it a blessing even though it be a bitter struggle for existence."</p><p xml:id="era1_1302296">Denison House, Boston, named for Edward Denison, whose pioneer work in London has already been noticed, is in a neighborhood largely Irish, though Jews, Italians, Poles, Hungarians, and Armenians are also to be found there. Drunkenness with its attendant evils abounds, and the young people have but few quiet and respectable meeting places.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302297">Already, however, in the short time that the house has been opened, the residents have gained the confidence and sympathy of many of their neighbors, and have come to understand, in some measure, the forces at work in the community for good and for evil. The work of Denison House will probably be especially along the lines of University and College Extension, and the organization of labor, and though but little that is definite can now be said, yet much is hoped for the future, because of the good foundation already laid.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302298" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era1_1302299">All loyal club women will patronize our advertisers, and so help to make our paper a valuable advertising medium.

For it will he remembered, that that by which he has endeared himself to countless numbers was accomplished in his spare moments.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302307">Although Dr. Holmes was undoubtedly a great and gifted poet, as well as an entertaining story-teller in his prose writings, it seems as if both of these gifts are subordinate to his own charming personality. It is neither the poet nor the prose writer that we have grown to love, or whom we mourn for now, but it is the man himself. In the "Autocrat" he has portrayed himself so faithfully that we can almost claim a personal acquaintance with him, and in his death feel the loss of a beloved friend.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302308">A convenient reference book on American literature, designed either for young people, or those whose school days are past, is "American Authors," by Mildred Rutherford.

It is particularly valuable as an aid in the Bible, for many of the things that are difficult to understand in Bible history can be readily comprehended when we have some knowledge of the social customs and inner life of the people. It is written of the Orient as it is today, but that part of the world has changed very little since the Bible was written.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302311">"In the King's Country" is a delightfully entertaining story for girls. It is a story of Christian Endeavor and decidedly elevating and inspiring. "The Sherburne Cousins" is a still later book from her pen.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302312">Miss Finley, the author of the charming "Elsie" books, has written another, which is a story of the Worlds Fair as it appeared to Elsie.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302313">"The Work of the Afro-American Woman" is a daintily bound volume whose author is Mrs. N. F. Mosell, the wife of Dr. Mosell of Philadelphia. Mrs. Mosell's very commendable object in writing this book was to do for the women of her own race what had already been done for other women more favorably circumstanced. She has gathered together much valuable information and presents it to her readers in a clear, bright and entertaining manner, and no one can read the little volume without feeling a deeper interest in the progress of his race, and gaining much inspiration for nobler and better work in the future.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302314">The plan of the book is quite comprehensive, containing reference the to work of our women in whatever lines in which they have achieved success, and is interspersed with interesting personal notes. Considerable space is devoted to the great works in which Miss Ida B. Wells is engaged.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302315">It is a pleasure to note that Mrs. Mosell has not omitted to mention that great army of women workers, the home-makers, whom it would be impossible to call by name, but to whom a race we owe far more for our advancement and improvement than we do to a few teachers and scribblers here and there.

written another called "The Mahdi," which lovers of this most admirable writer will eagerly welcome. It promises to be a tale of love and heroism. "The Manxman" is considered by deep thinkers to be by far the best novel published recently, in spite of the popularity of "Trilby" and others. In fact, it is declared by some to be the best book we have had since the publication of "Adam Bede." <choice><sic>Paine</sic><corr>Caine</corr></choice> is at his best in the delineation of his masculine characters, and one's sympathy for the misfortune of his heroes is mingled with a deep admiration for their manliness and nobleness of soul.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302318">The sale of Du Maurier's "Trilby " is said to have reached one hundred thousand copies.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302319">It is rumored that F.

WILLIAMS.</head><p xml:id="era1_1302320">At the urgent solicitation of friends--members of the Woman's Club of Chicago--Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams allowed her name to be offered for membership to that organization. For three years Mrs. Williams filled nearly all the offices, including that of vice-president and secretary of the Illinois Woman's Alliance, a central body composed of all the women's clubs. She is chairman of the committee on state schools for dependent children.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302321">She held a representative position on the World's Fair Board and took a prominent part in the parliament of religions. Her paper read at the gathering on "What can Religion do to advance the condition of the Negro?" together with her portrait, appears in the Rev. Dr. Barrow's work, "The World's Parliament of Religion." As a lecturer, Mrs. Williams is in great demand. And yet, although thus well equipped to help on the work the Woman's clubs are formed to do, the modicum of negro blood in her veins out-weighed her eminent fitness, and club principle made a weak surrender to personal prejudice, and her name was rejected.</p><p xml:id="era1_1302322">However, Mrs. Williams is philosophical and brave, and after the first sting of the affront put upon her is over, will recall with amused contempt the hysterical antics of her former associates in work, in their efforts to prevent the club giving legitimate recognition to the helpful work she had long been doing as an individual. Mrs. Williams can wait; there are greater things in store for her than mere membership in a club of narrow-minded women--and even that will come to her soon. There is no limit now to the possibilities of a woman endowed like Fannie Barrier Williams, and soon there will be no hindrance.</p></div><div xml:id="era1_09.20" type="Report"><head rend="center">For St. Monica's Benefit.</head><p xml:id="era1_1302323">The first doll exhibition ever given in Boston was held in the parlors of the Brunswick Hotel, Wednesday, Nov. 21st, for St. Monica's home for sick women.
