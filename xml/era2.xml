At a time and in a community where people are talked to, and at, and about until they are more inclined to run from rather than to lectures, it is gratifying to note that, so novel in scheme and so inspiring in result was this talk, that the enthusiasm created by it is likely to run and spread and create a wide interest to hear the remainder of the course. These lectures are given at the Club's expense and are free to the public. The next one will be given April 11. </p><p xml:id="era2_1305">Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, editor of the Illinois department of the WOMAN'S ERA and secretary of the Illinois Woman's Alliance, is expected to deliver a series of lectures in New England in April. </p><p xml:id="era2_1306">The March literary meeting of the Woman's Era Club was in charge of the Committee on Manners and Morals, Miss Eliza Gardner, chairman. </p></div><div xml:id="era2_01.02" type="Club_Notes"><docAuthor>Florida Ruffin Ridley</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_1307">Two well prepared papers were read, one by Mrs. Agnes Adams on "Our Needs," and the other by Mrs. Alice Casneau on "Morals and Manners."

Mr. T. Thomas Fortune, who easily heads the list of our newspaper men, has recently criticized the race with which he is identified for whining. This tendency to <hi rend="italic"> whine </hi> and not seize the opportunity within reach is cited as a special weakness of the colored people of this country. Of course, this criticism, made by so intelligent a representative as Mr. Fortune, has been widely copied by white newspapers, which have rolled it like a sweet morsel under their tongues, and have indulged in a perfect love feast of praise of the <hi rend="italic"> Age's </hi> editor. They have shaken their wise but guilty heads, declaring, "We told you so. You don't need any more rights and opportunities. You don't use those already in your possession. You consume too much time whining, for one of your own, who ought to know, says so." But the negro is by no means a chronic whiner, and his record in this country will prove that he is not. His progress in the face of all but insurmountable obstacles, of which he has hardly complained at all, has been a miracle from the day he was freed, without a place to lay his head and a penny to buy bread, till the present moment. If he has had one fault more glaring than another, it has been his long-suffering patience with an injustice and a barbarity which should bring a blush of shame to the cheek of even the unspeakable Turk. The trouble is, he does not complain enough to show how the iron has entered his soul. Everything, and I had almost said everybody, has opposed the progress of the negro in this country, the very heavens have been brass above him, and yet he has poured forth no loud lamentations bemoaning his fate, as Mr. Fortune would have us believe. Occasionally some of the more intelligent of the race have lifted their voices manfully against the injustice everywhere prevalent, but the rank and file have patiently toiled and silently suffered. If Mr. Fortune found many opportunities in the South of which the negro doesn't avail himself, he should put them on the market immediately. My observation in and of the South teaches me that opportunities for the negro do not run loose for any great length of time before they are captured and utilized. The prosperity of the average colored Southerner who has had any chance at all proves this beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p><p xml:id="era2_13018">Considering how great the injustice practiced by Americans against the negro, and recalling how he has patiently plodded along, with scarcely a word of complaint or reproach for his oppressors, a fair-minded person must conclude that the charge of chronic whining brought by Mr. Fortune against him seems as cruel as it is unwarranted.</p><p xml:id="era2_13020">But even if the negro were a constitutional whiner or had an organic weakness of any other nature, what possible good accrues from the merci-

less fault finding and sweeping accusations in which some of our leading journalists indulge? If one member of a family have a little more of the old Adam in him than his share, is it not almost treacherous for his relatives to talk about his peccadilloes where they will reach the greatest number of ears? Let us say more about the good qualities of the negro, particularly where it is likely to be heard by those who are only too willing to believe the evil reports of us. The majority of white Americans have an eye single to the vices of the negro and are hopelessly blind to his many virtues. No sane person would advocate wholesale eulogies of the negro, but before making sweeping denunciations of him in print, it might be well to reflect upon the trials and tribulations to which a dog with a bad name is always subjected.</p><p xml:id="era2_13021">The author of the article on whining negros has produced much that is better and worthier of him, but I doubt that he has received so many encomiums for any of his other contributions, or has been so affectionately patted on the back by his white confreres as he has for this criticism. Such attacks upon the negro are just what the average Anglo-Saxon editor likes, and he considers them great finds, over which he gloats in the most ghoulish glee.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_01.05" type="Article"><head rend="center">ILLINOIS.</head><docAuthor>Fannie Barrier Williams.</docAuthor><byline>Fannie Barrier Williams, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_13022">Though somewhat late, I cannot refrain from wanting to join the universal chorus of praise and sorrow uttered over the life and death of our greatest man and friend, Frederick Douglass. Like so many readers of the ERA, I sustained a personal relationship to Mr. Douglass that will remain always as an inspiration and grateful remembrance. But without intruding myself and my own personal emotions, I feel like blessing Mr. Douglass' name forever because of his always honorable and chivalric regard for womankind. His belief in women was never qualified by a disparaging "if." His own love of liberty was so full and cordial that he could tolerate no limitations based  on sex lines. Liberty to be all that poor human nature can be in its aspirations for perfection was one of Mr. Douglass' cardinal sentiments. But this sentiment could have no value or inspiration from him if it stopped short of womankind. In this largeness of spirit and thought, Mr. Douglass was always as ardent in his plea for suffrage for women as he was in his mighty pleadings for manhood suffrage.</p><p xml:id="era2_13023">No eminent American commanding the forces of public opinion had a better opportunity of knowing the worth of women by the exacting tests of great principles and high sentiments than Mr. Douglass.  In his magnificent struggle to emancipate himself and others from all the degrading forces of a hated past, Mr. Douglass trusted the friendship and honored the counsels of women. In all of his romantic experiences he found the women steadfast to the cause of justice, beautifully sensitive to honor, and resistless in their hold upon the heartstrings of public opinion. The singular purity of his motives meant always the exaltation of women, and their soulful sympathy and love or justice meant to him a deeper sense of honor and courage.</p><p xml:id="era2_13024">But in his high regard for women, there was in Mr. Douglass no lack of susceptibility to the mystic charms and gaiety of feminine nature. His was a poetic spirit, and the poetry of womankind was to him as joyous and inspiring as it was to the soul of the impressionable Goethe. Woman's beauty, woman's affection, woman's piquancy and charm were to him the very soul and music of life, and in his capacity for enjoyment of women's society he found continuous youthfulness. Thus it was that Mr. Douglass breathed and lived in a purer social atmosphere than most of his associates in the stern cause of freedom.</p><p xml:id="era2_13025">He so lived not only that men might be free and equal and exalted, but that women, too, by the same emancipating forces, might come equally into the estate of freedom. His life was a compliment to women. His eloquence in behalf of women's rights to the equalities of citizenship is a lasting justification of women's claims and contentions for perfect liberty.</p><p xml:id="era2_13026">By right of his manly confidence in woman, by right of his contribution to the forces that tend to the greater freedom and equality of men and women, by right of his high conceptions of honor in the relationships of men and women, Mr. Douglass was easily the strongest and best friend American women ever had among the great men of the republic.</p><pb xml:id="era2_13027" n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_13028">The history of progressive women in this country cannot be written without grateful acknowledgement to the helpful and inspiring influences of the incomparable friend of all humanity, Frederick Douglass.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_01.06" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">PENNSYLVANIA.</head><docAuthor> Dora J.

The right has been conceded them to vote for delegates to represent
the several churches, and it will be only a question of time before women will take their places as lay delegates to the conference.</p><p xml:id="era2_13030">In days of yore it was decided that "taxation without representation was tyranny;" yet, although women are the major part of every congregation, and are the figurative, nay <hi rend="italic"> literal </hi> right-hand men of the clergy, although they are more conscientious about their religious obligations and more helpful in adding to the revenues of the church. When the crucial time comes, when there is a question as to legislation or expenditure, then the men arise in their majesty and relegate the women to the task of remembering what St. Paul said, "Let the women keep silence."  In his Epistle to the Corinthians, St. Paul goes on to instruct the women, "If they will learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home."  The most active and efficient women in our churches are widows and single women. These women have the leisure to be Sunday school teachers, Bible readers, missionary and church guild workers.</p><p xml:id="era2_13031">The mere fact of sex decides nothing as to mental power. We are all acquainted with families where all the masculine attributes of invention, energy and execution have been absorbed by the girls. The sons have been weak, ineffective, and without ambition. Put those strong women in a church or any organization, and they stand out in strong relief against the background of mediocre men and women. Able, strong, original, highly individualized people do not form the majority in any community. In school, in church, in club life, in society they are easily discerned. They create an atmosphere which environs us. We absorb it, it becomes a part of us, and inspiration and expansion enough are given us to make practical the ideas that genius is often too impatient to elaborate. Let good gray matter rule in whatever shape it is found, and let the women write their declaration of independence.</p><p xml:id="era2_13032">You will be glad to know that our city has in its employ about ten successful colored kindergarteners. The kindergarten is regularly incorporated in our public school system as a sub-primary division. Conspicuous ability has been shown by these trained women, and they have often been commended  by the superintendent.</p><p xml:id="era2_13033">Miss Malinda Amos of the O.V. Catto School was selected to give an illustration of her methods with a class of children, at a general exhibition of school work from every section of our city.</p><p xml:id="era2_13034">Miss M.

Her kindergarten is an <hi rend="italic"> omnium gatherum </hi> of negroes, Russian Jews, Italians, etc., etc. Her musical knowledge, her sunny and sympathetic temperament make her particularly suited for the work. In conjunction with Miss Cassey is Miss Florence Cozzins, a very able and successful teacher.</p><p xml:id="era2_13035">I would like to tell you in detail of the work of each of these teachers, for each has something distinctive and meritorious, but space forbids.</p><p xml:id="era2_13036">One thing I must observe in passing. In each of these child gardens little white snowdrops bloom in profusion. I mean that there seems to be no objection to a colored woman teaching white infants; but in no case has a colored woman been appointed to teach in a mixed school of higher grade.</p><p xml:id="era2_13037">It is my pleasant duty to tell the publishers of the ERA of the many expressions of commendation  for the paper that have reached  me.</p><p xml:id="era2_13038">Mrs. Reuben Armstrong, wife of' a prominent clergyman of Harrisburg, writes that she feels the paper is doing a noble work for women, and that she intends to do all in her power to extend its circulation in Harrisburg.

If all the fond hopes are realized it is cheering to think of the vistas of usefulness that open up before it.</p></div><pb xml:id="era2_13039" n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era2_01.07" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">LOUISIANA.</head><docAuthor>Alice Ruth Moore.</docAuthor><byline>Alice Ruth Moore, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_13040">"Daring is a wondrous thing." Perhaps if I were a preacher I would call that a text; but this is not a sermon, so it can be but a headline. Daring is not only a wondrous, but a beauteous thing; and to behold an element of this sort of beauty in one is enough to inspire the onlooker with a sort of awe, not unmixed with a wholesale determination to do noble deeds. Perhaps that is why the American people can do so many unheard-of things that require especial strength and keenness and perception. They have always before them the example of a down-stamped people, daring to rise and rise again, to emulate and strive and be something. It's a superb sight, this magnificent abandonment of all lesser interests, or merging them into one; these strong, straight, swift-from-the-shoulder blows that this scarce-tamed animal front the dusky region gives, magnificent, even if he is made to bite the dust often.  He dares.</p><p xml:id="era2_13041">The memorial services, held in honor of the grandest of grand men, Frederick Douglass, by the Phyllis Wheatley Woman's Club, will long be remembered. Of course there had been memorial services and memorial services piled up in honor of the champion of our people , but there had been none like this, where everything, even down to the pumping of the organ and the ushering of the audience, was done by women. On the 20th of February, when the club was in session, Frederick Douglass died; and just one month later, on the 20th of March, the club met once more, but to commemorate that death, in Central Church. Mrs. Gates' invocation, some asserted, wickedly, perhaps, was far ahead of the praying of some of our best divines. The choir was composed entirely of women, members of the club, accompanied on the organ by Mrs. Alice Clark, and on the violins by Miss Julia Lewis and Emma Rose Williams. Miss A. R. Moore read a poem  "In Memoriam" on Douglass' death, and there were other things. A selection from one of his books by Miss Valena McArthur, a contralto solo by Miss Leontine Vignes, a soprano solo, "Calvary," by Miss Julia Lewis, the resolutions, drawn up by Miss Kennedy, and read by Miss Rosa Fleming, a solo by Miss Arabella B. Kennedy, and the doxology. All were especially good, and no one could have failed to be impressed with the general excellence of all. But--the gem, the masterpiece of the evening was the magnificent eulogy by Miss Bibb. From the moment she stepped upon the pulpit, and with her clear, ringing, sonorous voice began her opening sentence, to the climax of "The Greeks had their Alexander, the Romans their Caesar, the French their Napoleon, the English their Cromwell, the Americans their Washington--and the Negroes their Douglass!" when the enthusiasm of the assembly broke loose, Miss Bibb held her audience enthralled. And when she had finished, everyone felt that, with one oratorical bound, she had leaped into great distinction.</p><p xml:id="era2_13042">The case of Lent Brown, the young negro who shot two white fellows lately in self-defence, is attracting considerable attention.  Lists are being circulated to collect money to fight his case, to put in a strong plea in his behalf. It seems hard, incredible, cruel, to be tried, convicted and perhaps hung or imprisoned, because one was quick enough  to prevent being shot or stabbed.  So the women have taken the matter in their hands and are working earnestly.</p><p xml:id="era2_13043">Lent is nearly over, and the season of enforced rest turned out to be not such a rest after all, for the busy ones found they had more than enough to do in catching up with things left undone in the hurry and skurry of the season's busy time. So the rush continues, and there is only the two months' rest in the summer to look forward to for anything like "surfeit from daily cares."</p></div><div xml:id="era2_01.08" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">MISSOURI.</head><docAuthor>Josephine Silone Yates.</docAuthor><div xml:id="era2_01.08.01" type="Article"><head rend="center">DISCIPLINE.--(Continued.)</head><docAuthor>Luellen Williams</docAuthor><byline>Luellen Williams.</byline><p xml:id="era2_13044">Our teachers, in many cases, have to be both parent and instructor.

All of us know that the teacher whom the bad boy remembers with his highest regard, is the one who tried to have him do right for the sake of right, and who, in all her trying, was just and firm. The teacher who did her whole duty was the one who made the greatest impression upon him, and whose advice recurs to him when temptations come and trials invade.</p><p xml:id="era2_13048">Hundreds of opportunities to build character present themselves in the schoolroom. Do not say no, because it is easier than to say yes. I once heard the venerable Dr. Crummell of Washington D. C., say that it often strengthens a man to say <hi rend="italic">no</hi> to him. This came to my mind one day in the classroom, when a young man of twenty made a request. To have granted the request would not have done him any particular harm, but it would have set a bad precedent  for fifty other students in the room.  My reply was, "No." The young man was startled. He attempted to argue the case.  I only shook my head and said more firmly, "It cannot be." He went to his seat in a fit of anger. A quick temper was one of his weaknesses. Several times I was on the point of relenting, but my good angel came to my rescue.</p><p xml:id="era2_13049">Several weeks after that, when the class was reciting, some one remarked that it is often hard for one to do his duty and that it is even harder sometimes to say <hi rend="italic">no</hi>.  I gave them Dr. Crummell's opinion. The young man whose request had been denied, turned his head quickly from side to side several times, threw one leg over the other, and with a smile, said in an earnest tone,  "That is a fact, Mrs. Williams.  It helped me once, and not very long ago either." His very manner told what the occasion was, and I was glad that I had been firm.</p><p xml:id="era2_13050">But let us turn to the inattention that gives so much annoyance!  Having, in his measure, quieted the noise and obtained the co-operation and obedience of our pupils, how are we to prevent the absent-mindedness that takes possession of a child, now and again, when most unexpected and least desired?</p><p xml:id="era2_13051">The end so desirable must be a matter of time. Interest in work and cheeriness of spirit pave the way for it. Steady application to work maintained from time to time, will, at least, grow into habit, and "Habit", you know, "is second nature."</p><p xml:id="era2_13052">All this seems easy to do, but knowing and doing are two different things. The teacher finds boys and girls saucy and quarrelsome, noisy and idle. She has been told that she must be kind and gentle, that she must appeal to the higher natures of her pupils. She attempts to be kind and is laughed at. She appeals to their higher natures only to find herself like the people of old who cried unto Baal.</p><p xml:id="era2_13053">Still the noise goes on. How can she conduct a class in arithmetic, meanwhile ejaculating, "John, put up that knife. Willie, stop whistling. Mary, it is not polite to kick anybody. Get up from the floor, Bobbie. Ella, how can you expect to get a lesson and sing at the same time? Who threw those matches on the floor?" From the back of the room a voice cries out "O-u-c-h !" followed by "Make Jim Brown stop pinching me!  If you don't I'll hurt him!"  Then Jim Brown attempts to tell his side of the case, while sixty other grinning little mortals swing their feet and make confusion worse confounded.</p><p xml:id="era2_13054">Some say that the teacher should call upon the parents and let them know how their children act.  This certainly would be a capital way to shift the responsibility, if one only was sure that the parents were able and willing to administer correction the result of which would reach the schoolroom.</p></div></div><div xml:id="era2_01.09" type="Report"><head rend="center">COLORADO.</head><docAuthor> Elizabeth Piper Ensley.</docAuthor><byline>Elizabeth Piper Ensley, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_13055">FOR RAISING THE AGE OF CONSENT</p><p xml:id="era2_13056">The lower branch of the Colorado Legislature has passed the bill for raising the age of protection for girls to twenty-one.

From the beginning, when the probabilities were "all talked over," to the contemptible ending, it is a record of hypocrisy on the one side, servility on the other. That which we all hope is the closing act in the nauseating affair, discloses the governor of Virginia appeasing an enraged constituency by affirming on the honor of a southern gentleman his embarrassment and disgust at having been forced to play the host to a colored guest; and affirming also that the northern committee openly expressed its annoyance at the presence of its colored associate.</p><p xml:id="era2_13063">In Massachusetts that same committee is trying to satisfy the better element of the state by declaring, in suave resolutions, that it found the company of the colored member more than acceptable--positively agreeable--a sentiment in which the member himself seems to have concurred. And Mr. Teamoh himself, fresh from the insult to his state, to his race, to his manhood, declares himself perfectly satisfied.</p><p xml:id="era2_13064">So contemptible does the whole thing appear, that if the actors had stood for themselves alone, it could never have risen to the level of public criticism and condemnation. But the good name of the state has been defamed by its apostate representatives, and the self-respect of the whole colored people has been wounded by Mr. Teamoh's servile compliance with the humiliation of the visit.</p><p xml:id="era2_13065">For him we can conceive of no defence. The attempted justification of the <hi rend="italic">Boston Herald</hi> seems to us hardly plausible. It calls Mr. Teamoh's course that of a gentleman. But a gentleman does not sacrifice manhood, even upon the altar of good manners. True, he does not  force privileges from others, but on the other hand he does not yield passively a single jot of that which is due to him.</p><p xml:id="era2_13066">It was then the time for Mr. Teamoh to protest, not with noisy assertion of equality, but with the uncompromising dignity of the intimately self-respecting man. The attitude of Mr. Teamoh was exactly that which no gentleman <hi rend="italic">could</hi> assume. Undoubtedly the colored people were most unfortunate in the personality of their representative.</p><p xml:id="era2_13067">We who are fortunate enough to belong to Massachusetts, we who love her, we who are proud of her traditions and who know that she makes no idle boast when she claims to have always kept in the vanguard of moral progression -- we feel a hot resentment that a few time-servers have made it possible to include her dear name in the list of apologists for southern injustice. We are thankful that one, at least, of her statesmen has declared that Massachusetts' principles are still dearer to her than her dollars.</p><p xml:id="era2_13068" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era2_13069">The views of certain representative (?) colored men at the south are being much quoted as expressive of the real feeling of colored  people in regard to southern social conditions. But it is not too much to affirm that, under existing circumstances at the south, the public expression of colored men is worth as evidence about as much as the testimony of an accused man under torture.</p><p xml:id="era2_13070" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era2_13071">The recent episode may be appropriately named, "The Passing of Mr. Teamoh."</p><p xml:id="era2_13072" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era2_13073">There is a growing class of our people who doubt the wisdom in starting any enterprise along race lines; there are those who withhold their support from the ERA because they do not believe in "colored papers." Right here let it be said that the ERA is not "colored." It is a paper whose managers and editors are colored, but the paper is open to all, and hopes and expects in time to employ writers who are the best of their kind, whether such writers are black or white.</p><p xml:id="era2_13075">We do not believe in accentuating race lines, but we do believe in being more accurately represented than we are or ever can be in any paper that has no colored man or woman on its editorial staff. Colored reporters, space writers or special contributors can do nothing towards making the sentiment of a paper; and since it is a far cry to
<pb xml:id="era2_13074" n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
a colored editor on the staff of any white paper, we think it the height of absurdity to discourage so-called colored papers while waiting for the millenium. The need of our better representation through the press grows stronger every year and even more pathetic; while our growth intellectually and financially is opening many ways to us; yet that same growth is bringing us into relations not before contemplated by the other race, which consequently is resenting the intrusion. In many respects our situation grows worse instead of better. So long as this is the case, so long as we all suffer together, just so long must we all work together to bring about a different state of affairs.</p><p xml:id="era2_13076">Thousands of colored women subscribe for the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Home Journal</hi>; hundreds of colored women are active workers in getting subscribers; and yet its editor tells Mrs. Mossell that he can not accept contributions to the columns of his paper from women known to be colored for fear of antagonizing his southern white subscribers.  Think of this, you colored women whose dollars and efforts are going that this man may live in princely style; think of your money going to support in luxury the writers of that paper, while you hesitate to give ten cents toward the encouragement of writers of your own race! O, the pity of it!</p><p xml:id="era2_13077">How useless to be continually hoping that others are going to do more for us than we will do for ourselves.</p><p xml:id="era2_13078">God speed the day when there will be no color in newspapers, when the <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Planet</hi>and the ERA will all be employing white as well as black. In the meantime, let us not be content with being served up as others choose. We are about old enough to speak for ourselves.</p><p xml:id="era2_13079" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era2_13080">The <hi rend="italic">Atlanta Commercial</hi> says that "Massachusetts deserves to be insulted" in the Teamoh incident. It also scorns the papers which place the prefix "Mr." before the name of any negro, and closes its editorial by saying that any committee of white men that will serve with a negro are as bad as the negro, and that Gov. O'Ferrall should have turned the whole committee out of doors.</p><p xml:id="era2_13081">We refer northern sympathizers of the south to this editorial and then to the remarks of Governor Greenhalge of Massachusetts at the dinner of the republican legislators. He, the governor, referred forcibly to the significance of the oath taken by members to support the constitution, and declared with eloquent fervor that when Massachusetts sends her representatives beyond her borders, she asks for them no special amenities and she has no concern for social privileges.</p><p xml:id="era2_13082">In the broad spirit of the constitution of the United States, he said, she sends out her representatives, and while asking nothing of any state or individual, she demands that to her official representatives every right guaranteed by the constitution she ratified be accorded.</p><p xml:id="era2_13083"> "She is not concerned in the unofficial utterance of an official," continued the governor, "especially those made  in a sort of ex-post facto way.  Massachusetts never asked more than the constitution, and her character of liberty demands and Massachusetts will accept no less.  She can not afford to diminish the power of the principles gained by the blood of her bravest and best."</p></div><div xml:id="era2_01.13" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">CALIFORNIA.</head><docAuthor> S.

Those crumbling walls of stone and adobe, stately in their desolation, are the ruins of San Juan Capistrano, La Soledad, or some other of the missions in the heart of some sleepy Mexican town, where once flourished beautiful gardens and flowering orchards, where sparkled and fell in cadence soft fountains, when the <hi rend="italic">padres'</hi> word was law, and the savage Indians were initiated in the mysteries of the immortality of the soul under the signia of the cross. Stand within those vines when Luna's soft light changes and subdues the effects of devastation and time, wrapt in this mystifying light, something of the original and sublime influences of other days charms you; you look and see the hooded  monks walking, reading prayers in the mission gardens, you hear the Indians devoutly chanting an "Ave Maria," when the "Angelus" rippled over the eve of the missions content; or if nearing St. Gabriel (perhaps in the best state of preservation of any of the missions at this

time) you hear the bells call to prayers as they did an hundred years ago--listen attentively, they ring out the history of the life work of <hi rend="italic">padres</hi> Sena, Crespi, who with other zealous priests labored nobly and did grandly in the work of the church and humanity. About one hundred and fifty years after the explorations of Cabrillo, on the mysterious coast of Upper California, (where he discovered the beautiful bay which be called San Mignel, later named San Diego, by Vizcanio) the hope of the religious zealots was realized. For years their prayers had been unheeded by Spain, until political influences threatened to invade Alta California, then lethargic Spain aroused, and the decree to occupy and establish forts was given. Military posts were ordered established at San Diego and Monterey. Military control was vested in Jose De Galves, the most efficient officer of Spain, and prime favorite of Carlos III. Galves favored combining with military, religious influences and called <hi rend="italic">padre</hi>Junipero Sena into consultation. Sena's hope and zeal, intensified by years of waiting, hurried to meet the energetic Galves. Between the two it was decided the old Jesuit regime should be the method of establishing the new missions, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>, that the old missions should create new ones, by giving such church property as bells, vestments, ornaments, also grain, implements and live stock of such quantity as could be spared. The church furnishings were considered gifts, but the other donations regarded as loans, to be repaid when prosperity of the new missions would permit. Jan. 9, 1796, the land and sea expeditions, blessed by <hi rend="italic">padre</hi>Sena, started out. Sena could not accompany either of them, on account of an ulcerous sore foot, caused by a journey made on foot through Mexico months before. Being possessed of great religious zeal and indomitable will, he started out in March; the fervor of his zeal overcame the anguish of his pain, so that he journeyed on from mission to mission, until, early in May he overtook one of the land expeditions, enduring many hardships and perils. The 16th day of July, 1769, the mission of San Diego de Alcala was founded. The crusaders assembled at the site selected for the <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>, bells were swung over the forest tree, which were rung by willing hands; "the waters were blessed, the cross raised, the royal standard thrown to the breeze, the 'Veni Creator' rang out clearly on the virgin air."</p><p xml:id="era2_13087">Thus was the country taken in the name of God and the king.  The savages gathered around in awe and astonishment--according to Vizcaino, a totally low and depraved people, no orators and few warriors among them--the women in short skirts of braided rabbit skins, trimmed with gaudy beads, faces smeared with colored mud, the men without even the traditional fig leaf. The first duty of the missionaries was to nurse and restore the sick to health, then the indomitable Sena began the study of the native pagan, while the soldiers erected suitable buildings for the <hi rend="italic">presidio</hi>. Thus was sown the first seeds of Christianity and civilization in this work. The missions were prosperous, the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>loved and cared for the neophytes as their own children.</p><p xml:id="era2_13088">(To be continued.)</p></div><div xml:id="era2_01.14" type="Article"><head rend="center">OHIO.</head><docAuthor> Sada J.

We decided that she had been of such great value that it would be nothing amiss to give a few thoughts concerning her metrical life to the ERA. Leaving out entirely those who have given volumes of solacing lines to the public, we speak principally of those who have given us pearls which have never been placed in a casket; yet lines which serve to make the woof of life the more beautiful are uttered and often sung without a thought of the author.</p><p xml:id="era2_13090">In journalism woman has been struggling for the last four hundred years against surmountable and insurmountable obstacles, until at last she has set sail, and her voyage on the journalistic sea seems to be peaceful and is successful. In church and state she has been an indispensable factor.</p><p xml:id="era2_13091">Mrs. Norton, seemingly longing for praise of our fortitude, breaks forth petulantly,</p><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">"Warriors and statesmen have their need of praise,</l><l>And what they do and suffer men record; </l><l>But the long suffering of woman's days</l><l>Passes without a thought, without a word."</l></lg><pb xml:id="era2_13092" n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_13093">But Mrs. Adams comes to her with words of comfort, solacing words that have healed the wounded heart of many a weary one. What soul would not feel lifted up to the very gates while singing her "Nearer my God to Thee"? E'en though a cross raise us we are quite content to be nearer.</p><p xml:id="era2_13094">Again the curtains of heaven seem to be pinned back by the stars to let the drops fall for which Mrs. Codner asks for so plaintively in that supplicative air, "Let some drops now fall on me."</p><p xml:id="era2_13095">With all due courtesy to the Wesleys, Montgomery, Newton, Watts, Bonar, and many others whose names are household words, we fear that such women as Mrs. Adams, Codner, Phillips, Thrupp, Prentiss, and many others, have given us lyrics which will go with us beyond and be sung forever and ever. It is hard to determine which conveys greater comfort to our hearts, Robinson's "Come, Thou Fount of Every Blessing," or Mrs. Prentiss' "More Love to Thee," or Mrs. Brown's "I love to steal awhile away." Horatius Bonar breaks forth in praise to our God, and pours his soul out in "What a friend we have in Jesus," while Mrs. Bonar apparently joins him in her beautiful lines, "Fade, fade each earthly joy, Jesus is mine." A careful search of the songs of the church will reveal the fact that with but few exceptions no lines thrill our souls and cause the very heartstrings to vibrate as "Nearer my God to Thee," "I need Thee Every Hour," and "I Love to Tell the Story."</p><p xml:id="era2_13096">Not only in church has woman given us metrical food for reflection. If you would ask the question as to which song gives most satisfaction in church and state, perhaps the reply would be "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," by Julia Ward Howe. 'Tis true Payne gave us the song of all songs, "Home, Sweet Home." The presence of a woman in that home is the true poetry of the lines.</p><p xml:id="era2_13097">There are lines which have been consecrated with the tears and laughter of the last half century without a thought of the one whose fertile brain gave them to us. The metrical worth of woman will serve to help refine and ennoble the taste of the young. Luther said that next to theology he gave music the highest place and greatest honor.</p><p xml:id="era2_13098">There is one of us whose lines have had their day, yet live. One whose heart, under the most adverse circumstances, poured forth strains which the most benighted soul could, if hearing, understand, because she was one of them. One who had the genius to so weave her verses that they drew warm words of praise and encouragement from the immortal Washington. And today, in the same courts of praise and song eternal, dwell the two--George Washington and Phillis Wheatley.</p><p xml:id="era2_13099">The women of the Dicken's club were delighted with their introduction to the ERA.

As dollar by dollar adds to the accumulation of riches, and enables the possessor to be fortified against the distresses which often confront the poor, even so, when one by one, as a class or race, steps forward to occupy a front rank in intelligence and progress, he necessarily moves up a pace and opens a pathway by which others may follow.  If "the kick of a fly moves the world," and "no force in nature is lost," it seems only natural and just in the divine providence of the Creator, that man, made in the image of God, with an immortal soul of inestimable value, should be a powerful lever in His hand by which a people may rise to a creditable position among other progressive nations of the world. While this is a fact, yet the advancement may be more rapid and widespread by encouraging race enterprises.</p><p xml:id="era2_130154">Though the race rises as individuals rise, the rule works both ways, and individuals rise with the race.

What would be the condition of the country today had the brave volunteer of the armies withheld himself when a noble cause demanded his services? Did he see any personal advantage in an engagement which perhaps meant sudden death? I think not. But loyalty to his country and the cause which he deemed worthy impelled him to sacrifice all selfish interests, and life itself if need be, to establish the party of which he formed a part, on a solid foundation.</p><p xml:id="era2_130155">If we be convinced that the object is a worthy one, and tends to place the race on a higher plane of civilization, we may fall into line of battle for the right, feeling certain that personal advantage will come when we least expect it, and are not working especially for that end.</p><p xml:id="era2_130156">Mr. I.

Better let nature bring about her own cure or make an attempt to do so, than to ignorantly meddle and kill.</p><p xml:id="era2_130170">In emergencies her value is not to be estimated by dollars and cents. For instance, a child playing around comes across some one of the poisonous preparations of mercury, which has been carelessly left within its reach, and drinks it. A physician is not near at hand, but there is a trained nurse near by. When told of the accident she replies, "I will do what I can till the doctor comes." She gives albumen in the form of the white of an egg, varying the number of whites according to the amount of the poison taken. A prompt emetic or something to produce vomiting is given.  The physician has not yet arrived, but the nurse has saved a human life.</p><p xml:id="era2_130171">To the physician the trained nurse is a powerful aid.

Two thoughtful papers on "Our Opportunities" were prepared and eloquently presented by Mrs. Lottie Sampson and Miss Eva Lewis, calling out much discussion by members present. Owing to small attendance, it is proposed to have the papers read again, that a larger number may be heard in the discussion of this important subject.</p><p xml:id="era2_130294">The joyous Easter season was made gladder and the ERA office fragrant by tulips and hyacinths sent in by Doogue, the florist, and sweet mayflowers, straight from Plymouth hillsides, brought by Miss Etta Toliver. The ERA returns thanks to both donors for their thoughtful kindness.</p><p xml:id="era2_130295">The last of the public meetings of the Massachusetts State Federation of Women's Clubs for this season was held on Thursday, April 11, in the Second Church in Dorchester, all the arrangements for the entertainment of the many club members being made by the Dorchester Woman's Club. So agreeable have been found these migratory visits of the state federation that Lynn has spoken for the first one of next year, and Roxbury for the second. The annual meeting, to be held in June, will take place on the first Tuesday of that leafy month, when the Social Science Club of Newton will be the entertainers.</p><p xml:id="era2_130296">At the meeting of the 11th ult, Mrs. Jennie K.

William H.

When the emotional and sensitive character of our people is taken into consideration, his courage is obvious. No man is in a better position to speak on this subject than Mr.
<pb xml:id="era2_130305" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
Fortune, and the fact of his having given this subject his closest attention during long years entitles him at least to fair and unbiassed judgment.  Thus far no facts have been produced in contradiction of his premises.  The history of all nations proves beyond a doubt that people often need a plain, matter-of-fact expose of ruinous customs and nobility-destroying tendencies, as well as the individual; and that man whose mind is given to the advancement of his race is untrue to himself, his people, and the rational demands of the age in which he lives, if fear of condemnation prevents his calling attention to a condition which, if allowed to develop, is liable to be productive of a national disease.  There is but one way, according to our way of thinking, to disprove the obnoxious statement; and that is, as Dr. John M. Henderson says, for the workers as well as the thinkers of the race to put themselves in harmony with the forces of progress.  If plain truth and honest criticism will be productive of self-examination as a people, by all means let us have such; for when a people begin to think, light and its attendant blessings and benefits follow.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.03" type="Article"><head rend="center">AN EXPERIMENT WITH A KINETOSCOPE AND A PHONOGRAPH.</head><docAuthor>Petite Reine</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_130307">A man and a woman in a plainly furnished room. He says, Cherie, knowing how lonely your life is, I have bought and arranged this kinetoscope with views of the happenings of today among our people in Gotham, also a phonograph, so that you may know the talk of the day. If you will place yourself at the kinetoscope, I will shift the scenes and explain, according to my ideas, what they mean.</p><p xml:id="era2_130308">Ah! this picture, she says, is the Silent Shore, Sharon, a boat, and across that river the beautiful beyond, and in that halo of light a glimpse of some that have fought the good fight and received their crown, Douglass, Garnet, Peterson, Price, Ray, and the shadow of an innumerable throng; and here, leading down to the river, is a Hill. Yes, he says, that is the Hill of life, and here are a few of the many who have reached the heights and are laurel-crowned, Cromwell, Coffin, Harper, and a goodly number of young men and women filling up the ranks with genius, talent and education and full of energy and aspiration, all striving to reach that goal--success. And this ladder, that the topmost rounds seem golden and are lost in the clouds above, that is the ladder of fame; but why, says she, do they look with envy and try to jostle and push each other aside?  Surely the rounds of the ladder are broad and wide enough for all. Because, he says, they are very human, and the unwritten law of humanity is self preservation.</p><p xml:id="era2_130309">And is this the legislature? Here are some of our prominent women; they seem to be making a petition. No, they are before the school board. Take the phonograph and you will find they are simply asking that justice be done, and that some of our well-equipped teachers be placed in the mixed schools; they also desire that one of our women be put on the school board to further the interest of the Afro-American.	Meanwhile, if some of our women who are born diplomatists will make friends with the power behind the throne, Mrs. Granis, etc., they will eventually succeed. You know Gen. Grant gained some of his victories through strategy.  And this large gathering of women, do you notice how much of refinement and intelligence there is among them? That is the W. L. U.; their purpose is the uplifting and betterment of their race and to give practical encouragement to all branches of industry and talent; they are doing a great and good work, because the leaders of the movement have the element of success within them and their influence is wide and far-reaching.</p><p xml:id="era2_130310">And this large crowd? Ah! they look so sad and anxious. Yes, he says, they are the great unemployed working class. Colored people as servants have gone out of fashion. "It isn't English, you know," to employ them, and yet in some instances it is our own fault. People now require the best service, and we don't keep up with the times, but do things in a slip-shod sort of way.  If the advanced woman would start a training school for domestics she might evolve competent help that would be in demand irrespective of race, color or previous condition.</p><p xml:id="era2_130312">What a bright, pretty picture this is, she says.  Yes, that is a function given by the smart set.  What a lot of lovely well-gowned girls and charming young matrons; but it seems to be er--er--rath<gap agent="tape" extent="6 characters"/>from the haunts of men.  There are <gap agent="tape" extent="9 characters"/>misguided, unhappy-looking youths who have doubtless done their duty nobly dancing, and they are now wildly but vainly trying to make their escape, and those pretty girls have a pensive, far-away, expectant look in their eyes, as if they were waiting with that hope that rises eternal in the female breast, that her own special lord of creation will put in an appearance.

Oh no, he says, each and everyone of them had to see a man on business at the club, and they are there, telling with unholy glee how they dodged their wives and their sweethearts, their sisters and their cousins.</p><p xml:id="era2_130313">Why, this must be the great Mogul himself, and all of these Afro-Americans are casting tribute at his feet!  Oh no; that is only our colored brethren paying their money for the hire of halls for their entertainments. And why do they not co-operate and have buildings of their own? Because what this race need is confidence in each other and in their leading men.

The placing of women on the board is an innovation for the District, and the applicants were many and persistent. This being so, and Mrs. Terrell being one of two appointed, (and of course the only one of color) she, as well as the WOMAN's ERA, may justly feel honored. The large number of applicants made the matter of choosing difficult and critical, and the fortunate appointees have the satisfaction of knowing that they have distanced all competitors in fitness and capability and stand as the best obtainable for their positions.</p><p xml:id="era2_130317">It is possible that some of our readers are unacquainted with the career of Mrs. Terrell; for their satisfaction we quote from the <hi rend="italic">Washington Post</hi>, only adding that Mrs. Terrell has attracted much attention everywhere by her work in the ERA, extracts from her contributions being often copied in the leading papers of the country.</p><p xml:id="era2_130318">"Mrs. Terrell, who will serve on the board with Mrs. Stowell, is recognized as one of the brainiest women of her race. Her husband is a Harvard graduate, and they live at 1936 4th Street, Le Droit Park. Mrs. Terrell is an alumna of Oberlin College, graduating from the classical department with high distinction in 1884. She afterward taught Latin and Greek at Wilberforce University, Xenia Ohio. She was two years in Europe studying the modern languages, attending school at Lausanne, Berlin, Florence and Paris. She was for several years employed as a teacher in the Colored High School of the District, is chairman of the educational committee of the Colored Women's League of the city, and has been president of the Bethel Literary Society, being the only woman to occupy that position. She was appointed registrar of Oberlin College and professor of Greek there, but did not accept the appointment. She was the first colored woman to whom such an appointment was tendered."</p><p xml:id="era2_130319">Mrs. Terrell has recently been interviewed on educational matters by the <hi rend="italic">Washington Star</hi>. Her remarks make most interesting reading, and an extract is subjoined for the benefit of our readers.</p><p xml:id="era2_130320">"Mrs. Terrell, whose connection with educational work, especially among the colored people, qualifies her to speak with some authority on the subject, talked interestingly on what she hoped might be accomplished in the future in educational methods. In the course of her conversation she laid special stress upon the need of kindergartens everywhere for all children. Especially is this need felt in the case of the colored children of the District.</p><p xml:id="era2_130321">"As to my views on industrial work, I have only to say that I should give some kind of a trade to each and every young woman who graduates from our public schools. There are at present about three hundred girls in the High School; of this number it is possible for a hundred, perhaps, to receive appointments as teachers. What is to become of the other two hundred, with so many avenues of industry closed against them on account of their color? To be sure, it is possible for them to learn the dressmaker's trade, but they cannot all make a living at dressmaking.</p><p xml:id="era2_130322">"I venture to state that it would be impossible to find a first-class millinery establishment to which a colored girl would be admitted as an apprentice. So I might go on multiplying examples of the disabilities under which our young women labor.</p><p xml:id="era2_130324">"The conclusion of the whole matter is simply this: Let the public schools equip our young women with trades, which they can acquire nowhere else. Let our girls be instructed in all the occupations in which women may engage. The dignity of labor I should preach in season and out, making it a cardinal principle of my ideal system. All young women who have not a pronounced leaning toward teaching should be urged to learn a trade at the beginning of the High School course. One study in the curriculum should he dropped in order to allow the pupil to devote more time to the chosen trade. A certificate or diploma should be given to the pupil when the prescribed course in the industrial department has been completed. The day is not far distant, I hope, when the public schools of the District shall afford our young women the

What our humanity needs and what our religion and finer sentiments ought to suggest is that the very best agencies of our civilization ought to reach and lift up toward the most perfect citizenship all whom fortune and nature have illy favored.</p><p xml:id="era2_130328">Are there so many dependent, homeless and undisciplined children that institutions must be built to house, sustain and protect them through their minority? Then send to them as instructors not men or women, but men and women of the best hearts and the fittest minds and accomplishments. Women believe that the best that humanity has is none too good to be used in making good men and women out of what are called bad children. The best that woman can offer stands ready to be joined with the best that man can offer in lifting all correctional institutions of the country to a position of greater usefulness in developing character on the ethical side.</p><p xml:id="era2_130329">Our correctional institutions are not what they ought to be, largely because man alone has been the stern master. Correctional work has been a matter of business, a policy of hard necessity, of punishment, of discipline, of appropriations and of salaries. The management of all our institutions growing out of philanthropic impulses has cultivated a delightful aptness in the invention of cheerful names for such institutions. What a joy in such an array of names as Home for the Friendless, Home for Dependent Children, Home for the Incurables, Old People's Home, Erring Woman's Refuge, Old Men's Home, Orphan's Asylum, etc. What a vocabulary of misery! Such names cheapen the quality of mercy and make organized philanthropy but an expression of patronizing almsgiving.</p><p xml:id="era2_130331">But we need not resort to criticism in order to justify woman's desire to share in the responsibility of making a proper use of the humane forces that would rather save than condemn the waifs of society. We must be ready to recognize that men or women working apart in any reformatory work cannot show perfect results. The supreme need of our correctional institutions is a larger baptism of the home spirit in the management, and women, we believe, can bring this needed influence. She would justify her request for cooperation by making these institutions less of a prison. It should be the mission of woman, with her warmer heart and finer instincts for home training, to make the great body of society absorb into its home life every dependent child susceptible to tender influences. I have faith enough in human kindness to believe that there is somewhere a home for every homeless child.  It is possible to make every incorrigible child corrigible by a parental spirit of discipline. Give woman a chance and the great warm heart of human society will beat close to every human being capable of rescue front the blight of the vices. Women would come to this work with a heart and conscience, and ask to have a stronger emphasis placed on every influence that would tend to develop the home instinct of every child appealing to the state for protection and training. Women come to the study of these new responsibilities, not with selfish motives for honors and office and salaries, but rather with a burning desire to make better the world by helping to make better and sweeter the lives of the children of men. We would seek to give a new importance and honor to a department of human responsibility which society has learned to regard in the spirit of almsgiving. We would seek to quicken the responsibility in the breast of every man or woman for every child sent to a reformatory institution. We would establish a direct line of interest be-

tween every child of misfortune and the heartof every home in the land. We would increase the importance of every child and diminish the institutional features of every reformatory.</p><p xml:id="era2_130332">This is not saying too much or hoping too much for what woman can and will do when prejudice shall give way to the entrance of her love and aptitude for all things that concern the deeper and tenderer side of human life.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.06" type="Article"><head rend="center">PENNSYLVANIA</head><docAuthor>Dora J.

It was an impressive occasion. Many distinguished speakers dwelt on different phases of his many-sided life, tributes were paid to his unblemished integrity, his gracious personality, his strong mentality and magnetic eloquence, but it was reserved for a woman to electrify and enthuse the audience. Mrs. Fanny Jackson Coppin spoke of what Douglass' life meant to the young, each to work out in his own way the good work so nobly carried on by our spokesman who is now silent, he who in his life seemed to be a witness for the capability of the negro if only afforded the opportunity.</p><p xml:id="era2_130334">Mrs. Coppin spoke of his belief in woman, of her ability to acquire knowledge and of her rights in the body politic. I would be happy if I could even faintly give you an idea of her eloquence as she contrasted the condition of the negro in 1843, twenty years later and now.</p><p xml:id="era2_130335">Her audience was charmed and thrilled, and responded to her thoughts that breathe and words that burn with such deafening applause that she gathered their commendation as a weapon against them and charged all who applauded her sentiments to be responsible for carrying them out.  It was a grand object lesson for the detractors of woman's ability and an inspiration for every woman who heard her, so capable, so powerful, so modest.</p><p xml:id="era2_130336">In a recent issue of a leading Wilmington, Del., journal, Miss Edwina B. Kruse, the successful principal of school No. 16, has contributed a forcible article on the "Mental Possibilities and Special Endowments of the Negro Race."

A new era is opening in American school life. The kindergarten was the entering wedge. It showed the possibilities of childish observation and perception.

They say the parents will not like it. Well, suppose they do not? It is certain that they too need a lesson.  Most parents are alarmed when their children are sent home from school. They seem to feel it keenly as a great disgrace. Their first impulse is to go after the teacher. Even should they come with sleeves rolled up and sparks flying from their eyes, let them find the teacher polite and just. They will, in the end, conclude that it is better to have that boy managed by the teacher than to have him expelled and at home on their hands. The probability is that before they leave, they will be more severe on the child than was the teacher.</p><p xml:id="era2_130346">There is no question about it. When there is open rebellion, something must be <hi rend="italic">done</hi>--not <hi rend="italic">said</hi>. Some natures can be acted upon only in this way. It is a heritage that has come down from those cruel days.</p><p xml:id="era2_130347">All humanity is akin, but each people has its peculiarities, and we have ours. We are loath and very loath, to give credit, by word or action, where it is due. If one does a thing well, we seem to think a little praise will detract from our ability, and we begin at once to find fault and to tell of greater things we have seen and heard.  This spirit reveals itself in many different ways.</p><p xml:id="era2_130348">I once saw a young mother cast glances of the deepest affection upon her eighteen-months-old babe, as it sat upon the floor. But when the little one looked back at her, prattled and smiled she reached out and slapped it in the face. It seemed to me that she feared to let it see how much she loved it.</p><p xml:id="era2_130349">I have seen a large-sized girl trying hard to step upon a higher plane. I have watched the signs of the terrible conflict that was going on within her breast, between gentleness and habitual roughness. I have seen her stop and try to greet her teacher or schoolmates politely, and then (as though an evil spirit had turned her right about) toss her head up and stalk by. How pitiable to see kindness struggling in the toils of habit! Right here comes another opportunity for the teacher. She can help gentleness to gain the mastery.</p><p xml:id="era2_130350">In the heart of every child there is a spirit of kindliness. With some, the heart is full and running over. With others, the spirit is asleep deep down in some dark and hidden recess. There must be an awakening, before its presence can be felt; but when once it is aroused, the teacher does not appeal to the higher nature in vain. Refinement that springs from within, shows itself in the movements, as well as in the acts of a person. Many teachers spend valuable time in working on the wrong side. Begin within and work outward.</p><p xml:id="era2_130351">It is in the school-room that a child gets a great part of the training that is to fit him for the stern realities of life. He learns to respect the rights of others. He learns to curb his temper, to be manly enough to acknowledge his wrongs; to expect hardships, and to have courage to fight against them and down them.</p><p xml:id="era2_130352">There are teachers whose greatest force is flattery and fulsome praise. They give the child an exalted opinion of himself, making him believe that he is the teacher's sole support, and without his presence and assistance all would go wrong. The bad boy may be kept within bounds in this way. But what is the result when he gets out into the world? Who pets and flatters him then, just to keep him in good humor? Who jokes with him to take away the sting of a deserved rebuke?  Who thinks that he always should have the right of way? He will find life a hard and cruel thing. He will condenin his false teacher and hate her for her treachery.</p><p xml:id="era2_130353"> Let us do good, honest work, so that the boys and girls we send out may be honest men and women.

But I do not wish to seem too flattering in urging the qualifications of women which should entitle her to co-operate with men in all work that makes for the public weal. I perhaps ought to admit that we ourselves are open to some criticism, in our tendency to organize all our plans and schemes for the public good on sex lines. We ourselves help to discourage co-operation by too many organizations of ourselves, by ourselves and for ourselves. If women wish to advance any worthy cause by organization that cause would be better advanced by the co-operation of men and women than by their separation. For the purpose of social pleasure co-operation is admittedly proper, but for the advancement of humane and other high interests women are deemed incapable for association. For this mean discrimination we are not altogether blameless. The best organizations on both sides of the sex lines would be strengthened in their good purposes by co-operation.</p><p xml:id="era2_130416">If the letter M could in some way be added to W.C.T.U. the saloon interests could not only be regarded as one of the greatest indecencies of our civilization, but the blessed cause of temperance would be more widely triumphant in practical ways.</p><p xml:id="era2_130417">I cannot refrain from adding that for peculiar reasons we, as colored women, should most devoutly wish for a larger and more rapid growth of this spirit of co-operation of men and women in all good works. The need of the heart and mind of every good woman to help in the solution of the many problems of sociology, suggest the further need of the heart and mind of every good man and woman, of whatever color or race, for the same good purposes. The co-operation that women now seek for is the levelling spirit of democracy emancipating itself from the thrall of prejudice and looking toward the ethical equalities of life. In this agitation all progressive women are help ing to bring our nation to the deep philosophy of Herbert Spencer, that "no one can be perfectly free until all are free, and no one can be perfectly happy until all are happy."</p><p xml:id="era2_130418">A gentle brave man is the hardest kind of a combatant to meet, and it is probable that Miss Katharine P.

Mr Hallowell is the quietest kind of a gentleman and probably a revelation to Southerners, who seldom recognize courage unless accompanied by bluster and foolhardiness.</p><p xml:id="era2_130419">Mr. Hallowell, so far from ignoring Miss Loring's letter to the <hi rend="italic">Boston Herald</hi>, brands it as utterly false, and calls upon the lady who has made herself "a too willing dupe of her friends in Camden" for a public retraction.</p><p xml:id="era2_130420">Nothing has yet been heard from Miss Loring, who has probably not recovered from having her Southern friends shown up as they are and not as they make themselves appear so often to weak-minded northerners.</p><p xml:id="era2_130421">This is not the first of such occurrences in the south by any means. Probably all of us have personal knowledge of similar affairs. But in making a target of Mr. Hallowell, Camden certainly waked up the wrong passenger, for here is a man to whom loyalty is as the breath of life; who is loyal to himself, his convictions, to his sense of justice and right; who is not to be deceived by specious arguments.</p><p xml:id="era2_130422">Miss Loring has evidently retired, silenced by convincing truth, but as Mr. Hallowell "does not propose to release her from the responsibility she has taken upon herself," we have probably not heard the end of the matter yet.</p><p xml:id="era2_130423" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era2_130424">Mrs. Silas Dickerson, of Newport, and her daughter, Miss Kinloch, spent Easter week in Boston.

In either location, about a court of about a half acre, the building; the <hi rend="italic">prozolera</hi>or dining hall; a wing containing the friars' cells, these small, poorly ventilated, with scarcely any furniture in many of them, oftimes only a couch of hides stretched over a stout wooden frame, the friars only luxury. There were shelters for the live stock, and store houses for grain and provisions, dwellings, and the monjerio, a low stone structure, with a square court in the middle. The monjerio was the nunnery; here dwelt the mission maidens, presided over by a trusty old Indian woman, who kept vigilant watch over her charges. In the court sat the Indian maidens, working, weaving, spinning, chatting, and casting coy eyes at the opposite sex, whom cupid would designingly decoy that way. All the cloth, towels, church embroideries, etc., used about the missions was the work of those maidens. Life here was simple and regular. At daylight all were astir, and proceeded to mass, after which breakfast, of the unvarying menu, <hi rend="italic">atole</hi> (a preparation of barley) was served. Dinner consisted of <hi rend="italic">atole</hi>cooked in various ways, with mutton as an <hi rend="italic">entree</hi>; occasionally spinach <hi rend="italic">frijoles</hi> were served.  "At six o'clock P. M." supper was served of <hi rend="italic">pinole</hi>, this a preparation of the ever present <hi rend="italic">atole</hi>.  To this the neophytes could add nuts and wild berries, which they gathered and stored in large quantities. Every morning from the commissary department, the <hi rend="italic">navera</hi> issued to each individual his daily bread. The benedicts carried their allowance home to be shared with their families; the unmarried males carried their allowance to the <hi rend="italic">prozolera</hi> where it was prepared and served at one common table.
common table. At sundown, the "Angelus," when the laborers, neophytes and <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>assembled in the chapel for prayers; the litany sung, the blessing invoked, the day ended, all returned to rest. The licentious and brutal conduct of the soldiers toward the Indian women caused numerous outbreaks and "Indian uprisings" so that the <hi rend="italic">presidios</hi> were moved from the church settlements, and the <hi rend="italic">padres </hi> discountenanced mixed marriages. To induce marriage among the natives, the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>would march all the male neophytes in the chapel, then repair to the <hi rend="italic">mojerio</hi>and say, "Which of you, my daughters, wish to marry?"  This would cause blushing and questioning glances from maiden to maiden, when they would all spring to their feet and follow the <hi rend="italic">padre</hi>into the chapel, where stood in row the anxious and prospective bridegrooms, each hoping to attract the choice of his ideal, the prettiest and youngest of the maidens, who had the sole right of choosing.  Sometimes the fastidious maidens, after coquettishly eyeing the row, would not find one to her liking, thereby deferring her choice and disappointing and blasting the hope of the aspiring candidates. Some of these romantic marriages were affairs of the heart and very happy unions resulted. These unions were rarely prolific, attributed by historians to the new and sudden modes of life forced upon the neophytes. Remarkably strange, the prolificness of the mixed marriages; it was not uncommon to see from fifteen to twenty-five children in a family.  Punishment to maintain order was in various forms.  Capital crimes were turned over to the soldiers; not infrequently refractory bucks were laid across the knees of the "fat, greasy" friars, and received physical emphasis of his admonition, with salutatory effect. There yet remains, despite the vandalism of the relic hunter, specimens of the workmanship of the neophytes.  They were instructed in all the arts and mechanics, etc., of that time.  In that time of successful communism, there was no display of greed of gain, no lust for money or selfish aggrandizement--the time of peaceful Eutopian villages; there was, to mar the serenity of the pious <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>, however, outbreak from savage and unfriendly tribes; then came the great troubles of 1812, which destroyed many buildings and lives; last came secularization.  In little more than a century thirty thousand Indians had been taken from barbarism, and taught to cultivate the soil and utilize its products, to manufacture and wear clothes, to build and live in houses, and

above all to know and worship the true God. Cattle and stock were thriving and increasing each year, vineyards and orchards flourishing and yielding abundant productions, all basking in the sunlight of prosperity, spiritual and temporal, but the storm of secularization was approaching, to soon burst with devastating fury. The empowered <hi rend="italic">Comision idos</hi>, armed with the proclamations of secularization, seized all lands and stock; the cowled monks were to cease walking and praying in the beautiful mission gardens; disintegration of property followed; the Indians had their possessions wrested from them.</p><p xml:id="era2_130430">Removed from the restraining influences of the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi>, a mighty struggle ensued between their few years of civilization, and hundreds of years of barbarism, "and it is not surprising that the weaker foe was vanquished." The mission ruins, beside whose walls lie sleeping those who played a conspicuous part in the history of their existence, are the links that connect our civilization with the romantic mission period. May they be preserved monuments to the <hi rend="italic">padres</hi> silently sleep, watched by the willows that o'er them weep.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.13" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">OHIO</head><docAuthor>Sada J.

The second State Convention of the King's Daughters and Sons was held here.</p><p xml:id="era2_130432">It has been a great pleasure to sit under the sound of the voices of such noble women as Mrs. Margaret Bottome of New York, President of the International Order, Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson and Mrs. I. C. Davis, both of New York; the former editor of the <hi rend="italic">Silver Cross</hi>, the magazine of the order, and the latter the business manager. All three of these ladies are but to be seen to be loved. We all, no doubt, are acquainted with Mrs. Bottome through her "Heart to Heart" talks to the daughters in the <hi rend="italic">Ladies Home Journal</hi>. We feel that Toledo has been blest, and much good has been done here through these noble women.  Perhaps there is no organization on the globe, save the church, covering so large a scope of usefulness as does this order. Over 350,000 wear the little silver cross in His name; wee tots, whose little lips can scarce lisp the name of the King, wear it; hard laboring girls, on the mercies of a cruel world, wear it; women whose lives are one of toil, care and undeserved censure, feel the pang caused by the cruel thrusts of an unjust world no longer when the heart is hidden under the silver cross; silver-haired mothers become mothers indeed when they are all glorious within. Such is the characteristic of the King's daughter.</p><p xml:id="era2_130433">It was wonderful to hear what these dear daughters of Ohio have accomplished within the past year. Splendid, yes, marvelous reports were brought in from all parts of the state, of glorious results for the King. One very dear report to me was from the university circle of the Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio. These girls are saving enough money out of their own to pay half the expenses of an African girl in a college in Ashville, N.C., her lady principal bearing the other half.</p><p xml:id="era2_130434">I spoke to the young ladies concerning the noble act, and one said, "Yes, sometimes we have scarce enough money to bear our own expenses, but in His name we sacrifice our own pleasures for this dear girl in Ashville, for we all have learned to love her."</p><p xml:id="era2_130435">Thus the good work goes on. Would that the hearts of all wornankind could beat under the little silver cross and be pure and holy within. The work does not stop with philanthropic results alone, but these dear ones go on developing in spirituality and stimulating christian activities, thereby making the world better by their having been in it. Quite a good number joined the International Order, one of the number being your representative.</p><p xml:id="era2_130436">It nothing prevents, your representative will address the Y.W.C.A. at their parlors the second Sunday, in the afternoon. This organization offers the same opportunities to the colored woman as it does to the white. We feel perfectly at home there, and although the first woman of color to ever stand before them in such a position, we can not appreciate the honor too highly.</p><p xml:id="era2_130437">The Dickens Club was very highly entertained by Mrs. Hattie Cannon. It was our misfortune to be unable to be with them, thereby losing quite a literary treat, as they rendered a very fine program. This club has a membership of fourteen very studious women, whose aim is to become wiser in every respect. They have made vast improvements since their organization. The ERA is at home in this club, and its appearance every month is anxiously awaited.</p><p xml:id="era2_130438">An editorial in last month's issue concerning the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Home Journal</hi>forces me to say that the ERA has caused it (the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi>) to become quite jealous, as those who have been taking the <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> have given it up for the ERA. Last week a white gentleman friend of ours, a retired missionary, called in to solicit subscriptions for some periodicals in which he is very much interested.</p><pb xml:id="era2_130439" n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_130440">I told him that I could not find the time to give to his papers after reading our own publications. He was surprised, and said, "Why, you don't mean to tell me that your race has produced authors and editors, and can you show me some of the publications?"  I hastily placed before him every paper, pamphlet, journal and book in the library of the productions of our race.  "Well, well," says he, "you are taking me by storm. I did not know that your people aspired to such. Why, this is simply marvelous."</p><p xml:id="era2_130441">So it is with the white. They endeavor to get their literature into our homes, never once dreaming or perhaps wanting to know that our own sable sons and daughters are daily feeding us from the fruits of their own fertile brain. We are misjudged by many of the opposite race. You know that the rotundity of the earth seems impossible to us because we see so little of it at once, yet we believe that it is round. So it is with the white man. He cannot believe that the negro race is making advancements for he sees such a small portion of us at once. There are exceptions, of course, for there are some who know and believe that we are fast coming to the front.</p><p xml:id="era2_130442">Bishop Penick said to my husband not long since, "I never hear of any books or periodicals written by your people." This divine has charge of the work for the negro in his church. If seeing would convince him he was convinced, for my husband placed at his disposal the productions that would make him wiser if he will but read.</p><p xml:id="era2_130443">The Oak and Ivy Club of Springfield, Ohio, is now in China.

This club is composed of young ladies.</p><p xml:id="era2_130445">The White Rose Club is composed of twenty-four devoted Christian women who have three special objects in view. First, to create a greater love for church and more devotion to the teachings of Christianity; second, to improve their minds so that they will be more useful in the community; and third, to entertain worthy strangers who may visit the city. [I wonder if these White Roses do not wear the silver cross?]  All of the pastors' wives belong to this club.</p><p xml:id="era2_130446">All of the above clubs are of Springfield.

There is neither sense nor race patriotism in it." The foregoing remark so fitly tells us of our own participation in the same sinistrous line that we can not but borrow them to preface what follows. Once upon a time, and that not a hundred years since, two colored churches of this city jim-crowed (if I may so phrase it) their respective audiences; or in other words, provided separate pews for the white and colored people assembled.  The fashion, modeled after our own designing, was very soon adopted by an educational institution hard by, which, under white management, has done much for the elevation of colored youth in the south.</p><p xml:id="era2_130448">To think of such an outrage, as it is called, causes lips to pale and hands to go up in holy horror. But why object? We discriminate against ourselves, and should not, with a modicum of consistency, complain when others do likewise.</p><p xml:id="era2_130449">The recent admittance of Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams of Chicago to the Woman's Club of that place has brought to light the fact that two eastern clubs have each a colored member. As the General Federation of Women's Clubs has been invited to come to Atlanta this fall, the question naturally arises as to how the negro contingent shall be disposed of. Embarrassing question this.  The Woman's Press Club of Atlanta has become so aggrieved over the matter that it has withdrawn from the federation. Other southern clubs have followed en suite. The Ossoli Circle of Knoxville disfavors the withdrawal of one or more southern clubs from the General Federation of Women's Clubs, for the aforesaid reasons, and deems it best to take no action until after the next biennial meeting in May, 1896.</p><p xml:id="era2_130450">Miss Hattie Macafee is the agent at this point for Miss Wells' "Red Record."  It tells of many men--negroes, of course--who have been hanged to the highest limb of the nearest tree for (in most cases) uncommitted crimes. It is, indeed, a red record; yea, even more--a blood-dyed death roll of the south.</p><p xml:id="era2_130451">With Mrs. Ella Hamilton as hostess, the meeting of the Woman's Mutual Improvement Club occurred on Wednesday afternoon, April 24, at 3 o'clock.

he gets, the more useless he becomes. The white man will continue to be master in this country unless he becomes extinct, or until the millenium arrives, and the black man will continue to be his servant; therefore the wisest thing the black man's friends can do is to qualify him for that duty." It goes without saying that no such prophetic powers have been known since the days of old.</p><p xml:id="era2_130454">The Easter edition of the <hi rend="italic">Statesman Exponent</hi> edited and managed by the Woman's League of Denver, adds another feather to the crown of the race.</p><p xml:id="era2_130455">During the next two months hundreds of lighthearted, daintily-gowned girls will commence in reality to live. The anxiety of examination over, flowers and applause given, farewells said, school days past, and then the first act in life's great drama closes.  You, dear girls, will feel, upon that auspicious day, a strange thrill of pleasure, a high sense of pride, an indescribable exhilaration, something that perhaps during all your life may never be yours again. You have a happy anticipation of the future; so did we when we were in your place. The past is not so far away that we can not remember it still--the old chapel filled to its utmost cpacity, the music, the lights, the flowers; our girlhood friends, our parents, our teachers, smiling, waving their hands and wishing us a smooth journey upon life's opening sea.  No detail is forgotten.  It is a vivid picture, indelibly stamped upon memory's wall; and when you, sweet girl graduates, shall have grown older, wiser, and perhaps humbler, you will look back with pleasure, and may be a tinge of sadness upon the commencement day of your life's work.</p><p xml:id="era2_130456">The reception and banquet, Monday evening, April 22, given in honor of Mrs. Mary Church Terrell, who is visiting her parents in Memphis, Tenn., was very complimentary both to the lady so highly honored and to the ladies and gentlemen who showed their appreciation of one, born in their city, and who by her rare accomplishments has been so highly honored in Washington, D. C.</p><p xml:id="era2_130457">Among those attending were Mr. and Mrs. Robert Church, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Williamson, Mr. and Mrs. C.F. Hooks, Mr. and Mrs. J.T.

After a brilliant piano solo by Mrs. Julia A. Hooks, Prof. Thompson made the address of welcome to Mrs. Terrell, to which that lady responded in her happiest vein. And to those who had never had the pleasure of hearing their townswoman speak in public before, it was a revelation that charmed and delighted her hearers. Alter a solo by Mr. D.W. Washington, those assembled passed into the banquet hall, where an elegant repast was served. The toasts at the table were happily delivered and received much applause. The toast, "Our Guest," was responded to by Professor Ruffin, "Glimpses of the past," by Professor Sampson. "What of the future" was responded to by the eloquent J.T. Settles.  Professor Hamilton caused much laughter by his "Democratic Dog." Prof. W.J. Harvey responded to the toast, "Our Progressive Woman," as follows:</p><floatingText xml:id="era2_130465"><body xml:id="era2_130463"><p xml:id="era2_130458">Our Progressive Women. "Had this subject been assigned as a toast a few years ago, it would have been simply "Our Women," and the responder would have thought it sufficient response to say "Our Women!  God bless them."  But in this age, which the ladies delight to call the "New Woman's era," the subject of this toast is "Our Progressive Women." The advancement of women in the professions and in other avocations heretofore considered as belonging exclusively to the men, has been most wonderful. We men, once called the "lords of creation," laughed at the idea of women getting out of their proper sphere, but the laughter has died upon our lips and in its place are looks of wonder and admiration. Our noble women have torn down barrier after barrier that hindered their progress, and leaping over the ramparts of selfish ridicule, they are swarming into every profession. Fitted by nature to care for the young, it is admitted generally that the women are our best teachers. The school master is fast giving way to the school marm. And although I was once a school teacher myself, I hope the ladies will pardon the admission, yet I confess this is a pleasing change, for the school marms rule with sweet smiles and kind words, but our school masters ruled with a frown and a bunch of hickories. In the profession of law our women are slowly but surely making their way. As dry as Blackstone's Digests are, the women are eating and digesting them thoroughly, so I warn you not to be startled when you look up and see an office sign reading "Miss or Mrs. Blank, Counsellor at Law."</p><p xml:id="era2_130460">Belva Lockwood, the ex-presidential candidate, as a lawyer has quite a large and paying practice and so have other female members of the bar in this country.

success; the tender hand that was wont to calm the sufferer with its soothing touch has been trained to use the surgeon's lance and its fair owner now prescribes for the sufferer's disease. Aside from the wide field of practice among those of their own sex, it is said that they are the best children doctors in the world, and what a field is here afforded them! But leaving the professions, what of their progress in political affairs? Again, I answer, wonderful is their progress. That noble-hearted old Christian lady, Susan B. Anthony, used to be the laughingstock of American politicians, but she has lived to see some of her fondest hopes realized, and in Kansas, several ladies are mayors of cities, in Wyoming and Washington they vote just as any other citizen. In Colorado, they not only vote but three of them are members of the Legislature.</p><p xml:id="era2_130461">Truly then, our women are progressing and our nation's capital is honored in having upon its Board of Education the talented lady who is the guest of this occasion.</p><p xml:id="era2_130462">Gentlemen, think not that, the ladies are simply our imitators, because they wear our hats, coats, shirtfronts and bloomers; they are our competitors as well its our imitators.

A single iron bedstead with a straw mattress, a small wash-stand, with not more than one drawer, a old small table, an old rocking, or reclining chair, an ordinary wooden chair and a clean starch or soap box, with a hinged cover, to take the place of a bureau drawer, are the only pieces of furniture necessary. White curtains of cheap material are the best for the windows because they can be destroyed. Two cheap rugs or pieces of carpet may be placed on the floor, one by the side of the bed and one for the use of the nurse. Our open fireplaces are the best ventilators, so they should not be closed; one window should also be kept partly open, with a triple fold of cheese cloth tacked across to prevent draught and let in the fresh air needed. The ordinary china chamber set should be kept and a bed-pan and tin set added. Old cotton pillow-cases and sheets are the best for the bed, and the same is true of the gowns, towels and other things used for the patient.</p><p xml:id="era2_130485">I forgot to say that the floor should be scrubbed and windows washed after the walls have been thoroughly swept. An old sheet should next be wet in a solution of Platt's Chloride, bichloride of mercury or of strong lime water, and hung upon the door in some other part of the room. There should be a set of dishes kept to themselves for the use of the patient. If it is in the winter, keep the room at an even temperature as the doctor advises. The urine should be examined once a day, by means of boiling and then adding one drop of nitric acid, to see if there is any albumen present. Baths and sponges, if ordered, should always be given under cover, and the most nourishing and digestible food administered. Observe with care all directions concerning the medicines; watch the pulse and temperature. In giving the oil baths, let us remember that too much oil does harm and that they should not be given oftener than the doctor directs. One more thought. Let us not forget that the patient is alone with the nurse for the greater part of the time. The physician sees her only for a few moments and then he is gone. Now the long, weary hours of the day and night drag on. Her friends cannot see her; no sounds from without greet her ears save the songs of some sweet birds or the rustling of
<pb xml:id="era2_130484" n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the gentle breezes wafting sweet perfume from the flowers in the garden below. Now the nurse must do all that she can to comfort and enliven the patient. Sometimes all is done that can be, and yet the end comes on. The doctor has written his last prescription; the nurse has given the last dose of medicine. In the still hours of the night the patient realizes her condition. She turns to the nurse for a ray of hope or comfort, and the last look on earth from some loving wife, mother or child is given to the faithful, patient nurse.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.18" type="Social_Notes"><head rend="center">SOCIAL NOTES</head><p xml:id="era2_130486">BOSTON</p><p xml:id="era2_130487">WHO IS "ANNO DOMINI" SETTLED.</p><p xml:id="era2_130488">(Scene--W-d-l-d P-k Hotel.)</p><p xml:id="era2_130489">Mrs. D.:  "I wish I were sure of Anno Domini's identity."</p><p xml:id="era2_130490">Mrs. -------:  "Why, dont you know?

The members of the club may well feel pleased with the number of excellent entertainments given by them this winter, none of which was any better than the last given by Miss Gertrude Peake at the home of Mrs. J. H. Lewis. One of the features was a comedietta, "The Boston Dip," in which the now old favorites, Misses Lillian Lewis, Louisa Lewis and Gertrude Peake, Messrs. Marsh, Lewis, Hemmings and Gilbert took the characters; other features were a piano solo by Miss Glover--excellently done, of course; a recitation by W. H. Lewis and one by Miss Peake, in which much grace and training were displayed; Messrs. Hare and Harry Lewis gave pleasure with a banjo duet; but it was left to Miss Mary Lewis to make the hit of the evening; the young lady not only surprised her friends by the beauty of her voice in a vocal solo, but also delighted every one by her poses in Greek costume. Miss Lewis has decided natural advantages for such an exhibition; to these were added a good arrangement of lights and draperies, the whole making a most charming combinatlon.</p><p xml:id="era2_130497">The afternoon tea and sale held in St. Andrews Hall for the benefit of St. Monica's Home Wednesday afternoon and evening, the 2th inst, was a financial and social success. The leading spirits in the fair were Sister Catherine and Miss M. C. Dean. The tea table was presided over by Mrs. Sparrow and Miss Andrews. But where were Miss Marion Ridley and Miss Lillian Lewis, who were to have assisted in making money for this most needy charity?  The first named at the flower booth, and the latter booked to lead the "Vaudevilles" in an entertainment, and also to dispense "toothsome candies" to make sweet charity sweeter.</p><p xml:id="era2_130498">Mr. J. Rosemond Johnson gave his second annual piano forte and vocal recital at Steinert Hall Wednesday evening, April 24, assisted by Miss Maud L. Reese, lyric soprano, Mr. Edward S. Glover, violinist, Mr. Arthur Payne, celloist, and Madame Dietrich Strong, accompanist. The beneficiary, Mr. Johnson, was heard nine times in vocal and three in instrumental selections, the latter showing both taste and finish in the execution, which cannot with truth be said of the vocal efforts, strength being the quality most in evidence there. The singing of Miss Reese gave the most exquisite pleasure and satisfaction.  De Beriot's Seventh Concerto for piano and violin was rendered by Mr. and Miss Glover in a manner to call forth the most enthusiastic applause and an encore.  The concert was in every way creditable, and as an evidence of the esteem in which Mr. Johnson is held among the best of Boston's music lovers, a noteworthy success.</p><p xml:id="era2_130499">Our congratulations to Mrs. Terrell, who is well worthy of the honors bestowed upon her, we speak not only for ourselves, but for the many friends of herself and husband in Boston.</p><p xml:id="era2_130500">The "Harvard Boys," Messrs.

New York</head><p xml:id="era2_130504">The event of the season, the Bachelor's Ball, as was expected, proved a splendid success from every point of view, from the selection of the most beautiful hall in Brooklyn to the natty arrangement of the carnation hyacinth boutonniere on each bachelor's lapel, with the club colors, maroon and white satin, worn aslant each spotless shirt front. The decorations and brilliant illumination to a certain extent acted as a quietus. Before supper Anno Domini feared as to the enjoyment, and occupied the time looking for Les Miserables. One of the gay bachelors lost his laundry slip evidently. The same stood, just before "Home, Sweet Home" broke upon the charmed air, and said to a bevy of girls, "Say, <hi rend="italic">boys</hi>, ain't this out of sight?"</p><p xml:id="era2_130505">The patent leather market is evidently short. The Trilby of the occasion was the gallant president. He danced and-- But Miss Edie B--------, like a dear, little Quakeress, so quiet, yet so sympathetic, looked up in his handsome face in a way that would make a fellow forget an angel parent, much less his--steps.</p><p xml:id="era2_130506">Midnight settled on. One ought to have been gay Lothario when from a corner he darkly gazed upon his winsome lady in the mazy dance.  The fair Evangeline was radiant. Beau Brummel was as usual exquisite. We all envy his kinship with Sweet --------e, the loveliest debutante of the season.</p><p xml:id="era2_130507">The prettiest set in the room was that off in the little corner. In it was Our Rob, his chum, the Prince of Wales, Irvie Charlton, and a natty little fellow who wore a white vest. This is no discount on the one led by "our own Miles Standish." He's not as bashful as I first thought. Ern is all of the Revolutionary Captain of prim old Plymouth Rock --as handsome, if not as stern. The only time he seemed unsettled was when a pair of brand new patent leathers came into the set, mistakes and all.</p><p xml:id="era2_130508">Who is the belle? That depends, you know, on who answers. A chorus cries, "Why, the peerless leader of Brooklyn society's inner circle, Miss Katie Smith!" Robed in Cupid's own glow, a beautiful red.</p><p xml:id="era2_130509">In daintiest blue appeared the next popular belle, Miss Julia West. Then in regular order followed a perfect galaxy--in fact, the Muses. Miss Bessie Mitchel in Spanish gold; then Miss Alice Greenly in a queenly robe of white silk; Miss Annie Hawly--and oh, so many more!</p><p xml:id="era2_130510">Miss Evangeline Walker, whose bright eyes and peachy cheeks with their distracting dimples more than ever reminded one of early apple blossoms, robed as she was in snowy white, cut decollete. So many girls were in white, all so pretty! Anno Domini drank in the music of a soft southern voice. All else seemed artificial for the time. Miss Sallie Meyers is as pretty as her voice is sweet and thrilling. Such an accent!</p><p xml:id="era2_130511">You talk of young shoulders and old heads. Well, thats the feeling that assails you when talking with a certain little New Bedford girl. Her name belongs to the firmament.</p><p xml:id="era2_130512">The disappointment of the evening for A. D. was the non-appearance of the most magnificent looking matron in Gotham, she whose every costume is a delight to true artists. The scene needed her glowing South American beauty. The devotees at the Sons must have increased the score to a hundred. Selfish institution! They caused a shadow to fall aslant my otherwise perfect evening.</p><p xml:id="era2_130513">Bright-eyed Annie D-- and her tall fiance came not. The same is true of some of the patronesses. Why?  One, a queenly mother of three princely sons; the other, an aristocrat in every sense of the word, an authority on good form; and her chum; and some of Gotham's schoolma'ams; but thereby hangs a tale!</p><p xml:id="era2_130514">The young matrons were resplendent in their wedding gowns. Mrs. Charles Lansing, Jr., and  her tall husband--the boys insist on his being called Depew--were one of the most distinguished looking couples present. She was delightfully gracious.</p><p xml:id="era2_130515">Lord Chesterfield seemed unhappy, though he escorted a beautiful Norwalk belle, Miss Taylor.</p><p xml:id="era2_130516">Deferential Charles Day was fortunate and to be envied, in succeeding where Brooklyn's favorite tenor singer failed. Miss Mena Downing was radiant.</p><p xml:id="era2_130517">Mrs. Elizabeth D. White was in every way a patrician in a regal costume of gray, her bright black eyes and lovely silver-colored tresses making her look like a daughter of the Revolution.</p><p xml:id="era2_130518">Mrs. Daniel Brooks was, as Mrs. Brooks always is, her own matchless self. Some say in describing her influence upon society, she is the Mrs. Paran Stevens.</p><p xml:id="era2_130520">Mr. and Mrs. Tom Francis contributed largely to a chosen circle. He went around looking for
<pb xml:id="era2_130519" n="19 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
a novelty that night--a plain looking girl. Everybody was so handsome that he didn't report success. He was simply submerged.</p><p xml:id="era2_130521">Our Rob laughed without smiling.  His heart was in foreign lands--Jersey, I think. But his brother--the most envied as well as most gallant bachelor in the gathering--he escorted Miss Katie Smith, who consequently had to whisper "nay" to four disconsolates.</p><p xml:id="era2_130522">All the favors did not fall to the bachelors, however, for the other fellows, those to whom success never plays shy--they are a success whether or no--the altogether too numerous and too interesting widowers. On this occasion the handsomest was from Albany. The most popular--dare his name be called--the most lately bereaved, came alone.</p><p xml:id="era2_130523">Mrs. Harry Mars, with her proud spouse, was everywhere envied as the "little mother." By the way, the "little cherub's"  auntie, the sweetest and prettiest of Dr. White's daughters, Mrs. Jerome Peterson, told me there would be another ball (bawl) soon--the christening.</p><p xml:id="era2_130524">The great bazaar for the Sons is still on as we are obliged to go to press.  "Everybody will be there tomorrow night," Mrs. Harry Kemp said at the ball. But she reckoned without the bachelor's now famous supper and sparkling liquidities. Ah!</p><p xml:id="era2_130525">Some of the yawning beauties did reach St. Philip's Guild organ recital the following night, but I don't know about the bazaar.</p><p xml:id="era2_130526">Though the night was fine in Brooklyn, it must have been foggy on the Jersey coast, for the "Goddess of Liberty" was conspicuous by her absence at the ball. Everybody pitied Our Rob but   ANNO DOMINI.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.20" type="Article"><head rend="center">THE OPEN COURT</head><docAuthor>N. F.

D., made the following statement:  "The great University movement will not be fully organized until in every part of the country there is felt the same sympathy and interest and obligation now concentrated in a few university towns." In this sentence the keynote of the true mission of this movement has been struck and it is becoming evident that this belief is slowly developing in the minds of many living at widely different points. Paul Quin Monthly, the organ of Paul Quin College, Waco, Texas, announces the opening of a Theological School of Correspondence. We can but feel that this movement is significant of many things. First, at this point there has been sown the seed of University Extension in its deepest sense, its truest meaning. Second, a keener sense of the duty of the university to those who are debarred from attendance at it; and lastly, a fostering of the spirit of helpfulness that remains latent in the breast of all.</p><p xml:id="era2_130528">The University Extension Magazine for January 31 contains a paper front the pen of Prof. Wm. L. Bulkley of Claflin College, Orangeburg, S. C., entitled University Extension in a Southern Town.  We give below in his own words a statement of the plan of work now being carried out under his supervision.  And can only add that the plan is meeting with the success desired.</p><p xml:id="era2_130529">The class we have organized may serve as a model for others.</p><p xml:id="era2_130530">1.	The teachers offer their services gratuitously.</p><p xml:id="era2_130531">2.	The cost to each member is reduced to a minimum, the charge being only for light, fuel and janitor work.</p><p xml:id="era2_130532">If any charge were asked, even fifty cents a month, the very object we have in mind would be defeated, for the class we would reach are absolutely poor, and such is the almost universal rule throughout the South, where wages are small and work is so uncertain.</p><p xml:id="era2_130533">Each member of the class pays one cent a night.  And, again, the cost of books is but little, as most of the instruction is given orally, with blackboard helps.  As the class meets in one of the school-rooms, there is no charge for rent.</p><p xml:id="era2_130534">Finally, the object in starting this class was not only to help the two or three scores who may become members, but also, and chiefly, to set an example to the hundreds of students who come to this school every year from every corner of this state and from adjoining states.  They can, they ought, they will do a like work where they go.  The lesson is one of helpfulness.  It is easy; it is practical; it is Christian. </p><p xml:id="era2_130535">Should such a movement receive encouragement in all the colleges of the South, be they state or church institutions, a decade hence would witness a tremendous improvement in those brawny toilers, whose brain and ambition are vastly larger than their opportunities.</p><p xml:id="era2_130537">Then could we step into a higher plane of University Extension <hi rend="italic">in re</hi> and join hands with our brethren of the North in offering to the workingman, treasures from

Such courses cannot be other than of vast service to a developing race like our own. Some of our magazines might also inaugurate a correspondence course in English literature and history. It would give practice and experience to the teacher of the department and would help to solve the problem among many of our girls as to what they shall read, and what course of study or reading would be most helpful toward supplying them with subjects for thought and hence for conversation.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.20.02" type="Article"><p xml:id="era2_130543">Mrs. F.E.W.

Both subjects were ably handled.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.20.03" type="Article"><p xml:id="era2_130544">The WOMAN'S ERA has awakened a great interest in club life among Afro-American women. Many are the inquiries sent us as to club work in Philadelphia, but apparently so far we have not developed the fervent club spirit that might have been expected in a City of Brotherly Love and Sisterly Affection. Quite a number of our progressive women in the city are, however, working with the Civic Club. This club holds to Philadelphia the same relation as the Woman's Club, of which Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams lately became a member, holds to the city of Chicago.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.20.04" type="Article"><p xml:id="era2_130545">A bill to revive the whipping post in New York state recently passed one legislative body and came within about four votes of passing the other. As originally phrased, the bill provided that a male person convicted of felony consisting in or accompanied by the infliction of physical pain or suffering upon another might have flogging added to the punishment already provided. The Senate Judiciary at a later date inserted a provision exempting wife beaters from liability to flogging and limited the penalty to persons guilty of assaulting a female or a child of either sex under the age of sixteen years. Now we do not propose to argue the advisability of the revival of the whipping post, but simply to claim that if revived in behalf of any class of criminals that class should be wife beaters, instead of making them exempt. But it would seem that we are to assume from the action of the learned Senate Judiciary committee that reaching the age of sixteen or becoming a wife places one out of the pale of humanity. One may cause the arrest of a brute who assaults a dumb animal but if it be his wife or a person above the age of sixteen, we must stand by and witness such action without protest.</p><p xml:id="era2_130546">It seems that this clause was put in to uphold the authority of the head of the house. Now, it is often said by men that women do not need the suffrage to form laws to ameliorate their own condition because the laws are continually being amended by male legislators against the interests of men solely for the protection of women. Now this may be so in some cases, but does any sane person believe that women legislators would have exempted wife beaters from flogging in the case before us? We hope if the bill comes up again that the Women's Loyal Union with other associations will look after the interests of wife beaters carefully and with tears.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_02.20.05" type="Article"><p xml:id="era2_130547">Very many suggestions have been made in the various Women's Departments of the journalistic world pointing a way toward the desired result of putting off the hours of the first quarrel between the lately wedded benedict and his charming bride; counting up to one hundred, holding water or beans in one's mouth, and many other bright suggestions have often appeared, but I have just come across "the best yet" and give it at once for the benefit of my readers, many of whom are young and all sweet, who may lapse into matrimony at any time. <hi rend="italic">Quarrel tomorrow</hi>; now tomorrow never comes, hence a quarrel can never come.

I chanced to speak to a friend of a conversation concerning the entrance of our women writers into the columns of the Ladies' Home Journal to which many of them subscribe; this conversation was noted in a race journal, but feeling that the whole circumstance was not clearly stated I wrote a comment for a prominent journal. The article was cut considerably and from other recent comments I fear that the matter is misunderstood. The policy of Mr. Edward Bok, editor of the Home Journal, is to <hi rend="italic">accept </hi> such articles as have been deemed worthy, yet emanating from the pen of our women, but in two cases at least they have drawn out protests from the subscribers of the dominant race. Now the matter is of great interest to us as a race for the reason that we have long wondered why we could not secure space for good work in white journals, nor yet able replies to attacks on our
<pb xml:id="era2_130548" n="21 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
race published in great monthlies of the country. I wish the matter to be thoroughly understood and that the editor may not feel misrepresented. The point for us to take to heart is to inquire in other quarters whether protests are being made against the admission of our writers into the higher grade journals, and find out the remedy, if there be any, to offset this system of oppression, and if none, let us at least see the necessity of keeping our dollars at home and continue to build up our journals until they can compete with these from which we are being excluded.</p></div></div><div xml:id="era2_02.21" type="Advertisement"><p xml:id="era2_130550"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we221.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for Volume 2, Issue 2.

Nevertheless the really successful and businesslike women are exceptions and command attention. This is only natural, as women are new in the field and are not yet too familiar with the paths.  In this field, as in all others, examples may be found of women of all races and colors. Among those who are making names and reputations for business capacity there is probably no woman in the country who is a more striking exampie of pluck and intelligent perseverance than Mrs. Georgianna Whetsel, whose portrait appears with this article. Doubtless many of our readers have heard of Mrs. Whetsel as the only known woman ice merchant. She conducts the largest ice business in Nova Scotia. She is a young woman and a widow. Her husband carried on the business during his life with the aid of three partners, three wagons and four horses. A year after his death she took matters in her own hands and has managed so well that she now owns the entire business and has increased her working force by doubling the number of horses and wagons. Every year has seen an increase in the number of men in her employ, the number of ice houses, carts, machines and ponds owned and controlled by her. Illustrated accounts of the harvesting of ice from her ponds have appeared from time to time in leading papers, which we hope, at some time to reproduce in the ERA, for in Mrs. Whetsel the race has one of its most brilliant examples of business capacity.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_03.02" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">NOTES AND COMMENTS.</head><p xml:id="era2_130644">The Wendell Phillips Club held its quarterly meeting at the Bellevue Cafe Wednesday evening, May 22.

Of course everybody will be in Boston during the Christian Endeavor Convention, thence to scatter all over New England. Newport will probably see the usual coterie of old friends gathered together at the Smith and Dickerson homesteads. And even North Raynham, the antipodes of Newport, is threatened with an invasion of the fashionables.</p><p xml:id="era2_130646">The active and festive Domestic Science Committee of the Woman's Era Club are working hard for the success of the picnic to be given by them for the benefit of St. Monica's Home.

Attwell, a most successful trained nurse, conducted a hospital department. Beside the natural interest attached to such a movement, there are a few points deserving of more than a passing mention. As a part of the program, a number of our physicians and nurses were invited to be present and otherwise assist in demonstrating to the public the great progress made by this class of our professional men and women. Lectures were arranged for each evening, to be demonstrated by practical work on the part of the nurses, etc. Among the physicians and nurses taking part were Doctors Miller, Lively and W. H. Johnson, and Dr. Hill in company with two nurses from the Freedman's Hospital of Washington, D.C., Mrs. Fleetwood and Hawley, the ladies wearing the uniform of the Freedman's Hospital, blue seersucker dresses, large white aprons, with the regulation shoulder straps and white mob caps.  Mrs. Anna Rich was to have assisted, but was unavoidably detained at her post of duty at the Brooklyn Home for Aged Colored Persons. The point to be emphasized is the skillful and progressive manner in which Mrs. Attwell called the attention of the public to the work being done by our own medical fraternity. Mrs. Attwell might have secured some of the most famous white physicians in either of those two cities, her position and reputation among successful specialists being such as to sustain this supposition; consequently the endorsement which her act implies should be appreciated from a purely professional basis. The same applies to the nurses. It is beyond question that white nurses, graduates from famous schools in this city, would gladly have assisted her, just for the asking, if for no other reason than to attest appreciation for Mrs. Atwell's professional ability.  Notwithstanding this, the ladies in Washington were invited to assist, and to their credit be it said, they not only came, saw, but --conquered. The little incident teaches that when our people will prepare themselves to compete with any other progressive people, they leave no loophole for adverse comparison. There is no question but that those of our own who have, by dint of hard work and innumerable sacrifices, succeeded in making places for themselves, will gladly welcome intelligent candidates in the front ranks. When merit --cold-blooded merit--is the requisite, and not clique sentimentality, there will be less talk of colored people not supporting the enterprises of colored people.</p><p xml:id="era2_130650">The fact that we have paid little attention to the matter of encouraging our girls to enter the profession was painfully evident. Mrs. Attwell is the authority for the statement that, notwithstanding charges to the contrary, a colored girl, capable of filling the requirements (age, education, etc.) will not be refused as a candidate in the training schools of New York; yet there seems to be no disposition on the part of our young women to avail themselves of the privileges thus offered.  If they were wise, they would apply before a school has been established "for colored." Separate institutions should never be countenanced unless it can be authoritatively proven that they are a necessity.  Mrs. Attwell's department forcibly opened these questions before our people in a manner which will certainly make those who desire to progress think and, we hope, act.</p><p xml:id="era2_130651">A most unique exhibition was held during the early part of May, in one of the beautiful salons of the palatial Waldorf. It will be remembered that the Duke de Veirgua was entertained at this hotel during his stay while in this city. The affair in question was an exhibition of the industrial progress made by the various schools having industrial departments. The exhibits ranged over a wide class of work, from plain sewIng, patching, darning, button-hole making, to the most artistic accomplishments of modern dressmaking, millinery, tailoring and the most beautiful embroidery, lace making, knitting and crocheting.</p><p xml:id="era2_130653">There was a most creditable exhibit from Washington, D. C., in charge of Miss Siphax, the only one from a distinctively colored school, and in every essential it was on a par with any shown, excepting, of course, the French work, and nothing exhibited was comparable to this in artistic finish. In showing us the beauties of the latter, Miss Siphax volunteered the information that in France children are given lessons in needlework as soon as they can handle safely a needle, and by the time they are nine or twelve
<pb xml:id="era2_130652" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
years old they are accomplished in some of the most difficult grades. This accounted for the beautiful symmetry and delicate finish of the French exhibit, which contained many samples executed by children seven, nine, ten and eleven years of age. Miss Siphax further explained that this was largely true of Egypt, where fine linen was combined in a most wonderful manner with what they term metal embroidery. A sample of this work was pointed out to us that would otherwise have escaped our attention. In appearance it was like a drawn lace pattern outlined by gold threads; on close examination it was found to be very beautiful. When explaining her own methods in instructing the beginners under her charge, Miss Siphax was surrounded by many interested ladies at all times. The work brought on by her received many favorable comments, and deservedly; for in general arrangement, neatness, scope and artistic effect it was second to none in kind at the exhibition. It is to be regretted that a larger percentage of our women did not attend, as the affair in every particular was managed by true women, in what means all that could possibly be inferred by the term "real ladies." Among the visitors was Mrs. Octavio Furguson of Richmond, Va.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_03.04" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">TENNESSEE.</head><docAuthor>Sylvia Mann Maples.</docAuthor><byline>Sylvia Mann Maples, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_130654">It is surprising to note the number of intelligent persons of both races who persist in writing the word Negro with a little <hi rend="italic">n</hi>, while at, the same time they honor every other race, Jew, Greek, Gentile and what-not, with a capital. Quite a number of race journals are assuming, with an avidity, the newly-coined appellation, Afro-American, which has nothing but its euphony to commend it to the use of its followers. Of the two words Negro and Afro-American, the one, etymologically speaking, expresses as much toward designating us as a race as the other; but it is a late hour in the day to discard the former, in which there is nothing dishonorable, and submit to the ludicrous christening of the latter, which is at best a cowardly and ineffective dodge of a time-honored name. It bears repetition, so far as we are cognizant, no dishonor attaches itself to the word, and until a better one can be found for us to answer to, the only manly and womanly thing to do is to "acknowledge the corn," and by our deeds make it "worthy its hire."</p><p xml:id="era2_130655">At its last meeting the Woman's Mutual Improvement Club heartily indorsed the action of the Woman's Era Club in its condemnation of the too prevalent custom of ticket selling by girls and young women, and its members seeing the evil done in their own midst by the same greed of gain, have without permission of their worthy exemplars in the far away Hub, adopted the same resolution.

The people's interest in their institutions of learning has never been so strong as now. The press and magazines have done so much to cultivate public interest in the educational work of our institutions of learning that commencement day is fast becoming the most popular event in the year's calendar of great occurrences.</p><p xml:id="era2_130664">Aside from being a day of inspiration to student, relief to teacher, and of growing interest to the thousands who put themselves in touch with the festive spirit of graduating times, commencement day has come to mean a day of annual recounting of our gains in the forces of intelligence and culture.</p><p xml:id="era2_130665">The men and women who now deliver commencement addresses are selected with the view of being able to utter something of interest to people outside the college walls. We now eagerly look forward to the commencement oration as having a meaning to all men and women who are eager to know and to do their full duty as citizens. On no other occasion in the year does the American orator have so large and appreciative an audience as on the day of university commencement. The people are in a receptive mood for reading and thinking, and the man who can say something interesting, instructive and inspiring on this occasion enjoys a rare opportunity for doing good.</p><p xml:id="era2_130666">We women have a special and growing interest in these commencement occasions, because they mean such a helpful reinforcement to the intelligence of our working forces. With a due appreciation of the thousands of educated and capable women who have done so much to advance our peculiar interests, we are yet lacking in women whose mental training has given them a sanity and balance of judgment and steadiness of conviction in affairs of large importance.</p><p xml:id="era2_130667">Women who have daughters capable of culture can do nothing better for womankind, as well as for the daughters, than to give them the advantage of a college training, or an education that will have an equivalent value in the quality of their intelligence. The mental discipline and culture that are the most important furnishings of a university education will save us from many humiliating mistakes in our public efforts, and will tend to lesson the small jealousies, petty envies and the general unkindness of woman for womankind.  Oh, for some kind of culture or talisman that will save us women from being consumed by each other in our ambitions to be useful in this world of ours!</p><p xml:id="era2_130668">While talking about women's peculiar interest in commencement week, it is perhaps offensively irrelevant to suggest a subject so dreary and irritating as that of moving and house-cleaning. But oh my, it is such a season of misery for all of us that the thought of it intrudes itself in spite of ourselves.  This is the season of the year when all of our weaknesses seem to be on trial. By the general consent of all womankind and the amiable tolerance of our "lords and masters," we lay aside our sweetness, our lovableness and charms and put in evidence all our hatefulness and biting impatience against every body and every thing.  Womankind seems to take a savage delight in this season of cleaning, renovating and reordering of her household.</p><p xml:id="era2_130669">If it be true that in the spring the young man's fancy turns to wooing and home making, it is equally true that the married man's realities tempt him to stray as far as possible froin the disturbances of his own roof tree. I think we would all be frightened if it could be made clear to us how much of domestic unhappiness and family disintegration are traceable to these spring time outbreaks of woman's peevishness.</p><p xml:id="era2_130671">What poor creatures we are, and how slowly we emancipate ourselves from many of our self-imposed afflictions!  Fretfulness over housecleaning, like tight lacing and balloon sleeves, seem to be some of our cherished miseries. Perhaps the college bred woman will, by and by, show us how to meet and treat philosophically these many disagreeable necessities. Then again, we have some hope in those useful inventions that year by year are diminishing the drudgery of home keeping. It really looks as if steam and gas and electricity, in various ways, are soon to make all kinds of housekeeping so delightfully easy that woman's only cause for ill-temper will

In the meantime, it is to be fervently hoped that we will become strong enough in the command of our better selves to endure more gracefully the trials of our little responsibilities.  Woman will make a very sorry figure in the contentions of politics and business, and in the larger questions of public concern if she fail to cultivate the patience, the good judgment and good sense that she nw so often lacks in the domestic sphere.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_03.07" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">LOUISIANA.</head><docAuthor>Alice Ruth Moore.</docAuthor><byline>Alice Ruth Moore, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_130672">Owing to a temporary blindness, entailing great suffering and much inconvenience, the writer of this column was unable to get any matter ready for the May issue.</p><p xml:id="era2_130673">One of the most interesting things just about now is the decision of the Phyllis Wheatley Woman's Club to not only countenance the negro building at the Atlanta exposition, which opens in September, but to send an exhibit. This decision was arrived at, though not without some discussion on the part of the members and a little bitterness. It was argued that the line drawn in the South was drawn enough by the "other side," without our attempting to do anything of that sort ourselves. But, as one of the members expressed it, the exposition would certainly go on, and whether we countenanced it or not the Negro Department would be a success, Phyllis Wheatley Club to the contrary. The only way to convince our friends on the other side that we could do anything was to <hi rend="italic">show</hi> them, and here was an excellent chance to show as individuals and members of a race popularly supposed to he unable to do anything but subsist upon the charity of others. There is no doubt but that this exposition, like the one in Chicago, if not representing the negroes would be censured for it by them, and when a disposition is shown by the commissioners to grant space, the usual kick is made. The upshot of it all was that the club gave its decision not only to countenance the negro building but to make an exhibit there.</p><p xml:id="era2_130674">Another series of violent discussions which have been lasting some months  were recently closed by the dedication of the new St. Catherine's church in Tulane Ave.  St. Catherine's occupies the site of the old St. Joseph, now one of the largest churches in America.</p><p xml:id="era2_130675">When Mother Catherine Drexel some while ago sent Archbishop Janssens a handsome sum of money to be used in a manner that would do most good to the colored people of New Orleans, a clamor for a new church, a Catholic church exelusively for the colored people, where they might be ensured from discrimination of any sort, where there could be colored altar boys, a colored choir, and, if necessary, a colored priest. So preparations were made to embellish and repair the old church and it was announced that all would be ready in a short while. A storm of opposition was raised at once, newspapers and editors waxed furious; the archbishop was deluged in petitions, some lengthy, some pithy, some with many signatures, some with a few signatures that meant something. The archbishop was also kept busy receiving delegations of objectors who besieged him with reasons why this thing could not be.  But the preparations for the new church went right on.</p><p xml:id="era2_130676">As a matter of fact, it is unfortunate that the colored people of New Orleans should be instrumental in separating themselves from the rest of the Catholics in the city. The Catholic religion is the one broad common plane where all might meet and for the nonce forget the petty prejudices of birth or race. Within the average Catholic church prince or peasant, maid and mistress, man and master may kneel side by side and receive alike impartially the bread of the communion table. The separation of the colored people by themselves from the rest of the city is destroying the most beautiful portion of the Catholic creed. True the archbishop has made it most plain that this church does not, of a necessity, compel all colored people of the Catholic persuasion to attend it. That it is for one parish alone and only for those who desire to attend, and that the doors and pews and confessionals of the other Catholic churches are open as widely as ever to the colored people. But it is plain to see that it won't be long before such gentle means as a quiet discrimination all along the parishes will force the colored worshippers into the "Jim Crow" church. It is indeed quite an unfortunate move.</p><p xml:id="era2_130678">The Teachers' League has been busy for the
<pb xml:id="era2_130677" n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
past month. Our kindergartens and kindergarteners are, or rather were, <hi rend="italic">non est</hi>. So the league secured the services of Miss Elizabeth K. Mathews from Des Moines, Ia., to come here for a month and hold classes of the members of the league. The classes were held every afternoon from three to five, special permission having been obtained from the superintendent, Mr. Easton, to dismiss those teachers who were interested a half hour earlier than usual. The work done was very interesting and a great deal was accomplished in a month's time. The result of Miss Mathew's labor was visible in an increased interest in the school work and in the introduction of more manual training in the schools.</p><p xml:id="era2_130679">While here she visited and worked with pupils and teachers in the different schools, attended and addressed a meeting of not only the Teachers' League but the Phyllis Wheatley Club also. Miss Mathews also gave a lecture, "A Trip to Yellowstone Park," for the benefit of the Phyllis Wheatley Club.</p><p xml:id="era2_130680">The air is full of Commencement. Out of the four large universities here, three, Leland, Straight and New Orleans, have closed, leaving only Southern and the public schools to drag through the long hot month of June. Straight University fairly outdid itself in the matter of Commencement Week. It always has an entire week given over to festivities of a general nature, but this year the festivities were unusually interesting. The class of '95 is the largest one since the year of 1888.</p><p xml:id="era2_130681">Two new things crowned the year's work. First, the alunini did away with their annual reception, and second, the school granted its first musical certificate.</p><p xml:id="era2_130682">Heretofore the immense reception given by Straight University Alumni has always been looked forward to with no little interest by the friends and patrons of the school. The evening before Commencement was spent by the alumnae in a banquet tendered by the school from five to seven, of which members only were allowed to partake. This was followed by a reception from seven to ten, to which each member had issued invitations, and as the body numbers some two hundred or more it was necessarily large. There was always a musical and literary programme, refreshments and a jollification. But this year all was changed; there was only the banquet, the annual address, which was delivered by Dr. A.J. Lopez, some music, and that was all. The sum usually expended for the reception was placed to the account of the school.</p><p xml:id="era2_130683">The other event of peculiar importance was the completion of the musical course by Miss Beatrice F. Rochin. It is the first time in the history of the university that any pupil has stuck to the eight years' study requisite for a completion of piano course. Miss Rochin of '95 celebrated her victory the Thursday before Commencement by a recital, assisted by her sister, Miss Anita, '95, and Mr. Wendell McNeal, '96, on the violin, Mr. Lockhard, '95, with a vocal solo, and a number of young ladies of the Normal department in Delsarte tableaux. Miss Rochin had a very trying ordeal to pass through in playing solo after solo before an intensely critical and rather incredulous audience, but she acquitted herself magnificently and won applause and flowers by the load.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_03.08" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">PENNSYLVANIA.</head><docAuthor>Dora J.

Cole, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_130684">In the April number of the ERA perhaps it will be remembered that in this column were pressed the claims of women to greater recognition in the government of the churches. The Vestry of St. Thomas' P. E. Church early in April passed a resolution allowing women in good financial standing to vote at the Easter election for officers for the ensuing year. It was very fitting that the initiative should be taken by the vestry of one of the oldest churches in the United States, which keeps up the high standard and courageous resolution of their forefathers, who founded this chuch in the infancy of the republic.</p><p xml:id="era2_130685">This extension of the franchise was accepted by the women in a very serene and matter-of-fact way. There was no unseemly haste; less than one-third of the eligible women voted. Those who expected strife and a complete reorganization of the church officers, found to their surprise the old vestry re-elected, with one exception, a faithful and efficient vestryman who desired to be excused from serving this year. Let the good work go on. We hope that soon in every church the women will be shown common justice.</p><pb xml:id="era2_130686" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_130687">In the Diocesan Convention held early in May in our city, the question of admitting women as delegates was warmly discussed. Many clergymen supported the proposition, but one prominent and venerable layman delivered a passionate speech in which he fervently hoped that he should never live to see the day when one of these "new women" were seated in the convention. He spoke at length on the subject and declared that she is "a horrid creature." The motion was not disposed of finally, but was left an open question for the time.</p><p xml:id="era2_130688">One is tempted to sympathize with this view of the new woman. That term and the phrase <hi rend="italic">fin de siecle</hi>have surely earned a long rest. It is a question with me whether there really is any "Mrs. Harris," in the words of Betsey Prigg. It is the same old woman, the eternal feminine, only the outward visible sign has changed somewhat. The higher education, the attention to athletic sports, the greater knowledge of hygiene and proper food, the thick-sole shoes, the warm winter flannels, have all made her what Emerson says it is everybody's first duty to be, "a good animal."</p><p xml:id="era2_130689">With this grateful sense of physical well-being has come that joyous expansion, that exuberance that all happy, healthy people feel. It has become a necessity for her to find an outlet for all this energy, hence her interest in church and state, in all that is on the earth or in the waters under the earth. Look in the home, is she not a more intelligent companion, a wiser, more judicious mother, a more stimulating and sympathetic friend? Surely the vast majority of the women of today are like the picture I have drawn, and may it be a continually decreasing number who may be described in the words of the Rabbi Voorsanger of Los Angeles, who says, "The new woman is a rampant and rebellious woman, who gathers in conventions and talks much; a reformer who seeks to lay bare the rotten foundations of society; an evolved species of Roman matron with a tongue like a lash and a rod of chastisement in her fair fist."</p><p xml:id="era2_130690">Not many years ago some of us can remember that southern alarmists created a wave of interest that rolled all over the country, by reporting the alarming rate of increase in the negro population. It was predicted that the black man and brother would cover the face of the earth, as did the locusts in Pharaoh's time, and devour every green thing in the shape of a white man. Tables were compiled, and truly alarming progressions were

Shadd's contribution to the New York <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> of May 16, in refutation of the idea that we will shortly be eliminated front the problem, is timely and reassuring. Having the wide experience that he has among the 87,000 negroes of the District of Columbia, he is able to speak with authority, and shows that even if the state of South Carolina is losing her black population, there has been in the District since 1876 a steady decrease in mortality and a regular increase in population, showing that the negro is one fourth more productive than the white race.</p><p xml:id="era2_130692">Dr. Shadd is hopeful of a greater improvement every year in the sanitary condition of the poor and the consequent lessened death rate. What would become of the country if there was no negro problem? All of us who are teachers know too well of the causes that lead to this alarming death rate. The insufficient clothing, the lowered vitality from improper and irregularly taken food, and the frightful ravages of that scourge consumption, brought on by night after night, during weeks in the depths of winter, attending revivals.

There is nothing very new or original in this remark, but it is suggested anew by the proposed Atlanta Exposition. There are good reasons why the colored people should be represented there and take advantage or this new and large opportunity of vindicating themselves, their enterprise and intelligrence. Now that our people have entered upon the project, it is hoped that it will be a great success. Nevertheless we cannot wholly endorse the movement; such exhibitions never do and never can do justice to the colored people. It is as impossible to separate the work of the whites and the blacks as it is to separate the work of those who have Irish or German blood. The result is inevitably meager, inadequate and mortifying.</p><p xml:id="era2_130700">Besides this, the Atlanta Exposition will carry with it the most humiliating conditions for all colored visitors. The commissioner general declares that <hi rend="italic"> we shall have all the rights we desire!</hi> But in the light of the past estimate put upon us and our desires, this is not reassuring. Doubtless the commissioners will add largely to their finances by including an exhibit from our colored people, but it is doubtful if one jot or tittle of the merciless discrimination carried on in the south will be abated on the fair grounds at this time.</p><p xml:id="era2_130701">We are open to conviction, but it seems to us that the only gain made will come to the managers, and that the "colored department" will be left entirely to the colored people, with the result that we shall not have grown over rich in dignity or worth in the eyes of the other race, and at the same time we shall be probably financial losers.</p><p xml:id="era2_130702">However we shall watch and wait and hope for the best.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_03.12" type="Appeal"><head rend="center">LET US CONFER TOGETHER.</head><p xml:id="era2_130703">The coming together of our women from all over the country for consultation, for conference, for the personal exchange of greeting, which means so much in the way of encouragement and inspiration, has been a burning desire in the breasts of the colored women in every section of the United States.</p><p xml:id="era2_130704">The matter has been discussed and re-discussed. Of some things all are convinced--the need of such a conference is great, the benefit to be derived inevitable and inestimable. In view of this, we, the women of the Woman's Era Club of Boston, send forth a call to our sisters all over the country, members of all clubs, societies, associations, or circles to meet with us in conference in this city of Boston.</p><p xml:id="era2_130705">And we urge upon all clubs, societies, associations and circles to take immediate action, looking towards the sending of delegates to this convention.</p><p xml:id="era2_130706">Boston has been selected as a meeting place because it has seemed to be the general opinion that here, and here only can be found the atmosphere which would best interpret and represent us, our position, our needs and our aims. One of the pressing needs of our cause is the education of the public to a just appreciation of us, and only here can we gain the attention upon which so much depends.</p><p xml:id="era2_130707">It is designed to hold the convention three days, the first of which will be given up to business, the second and third to the consideration of vital questions concerning our moral, mental, physical and financial growth and well-being, these to be presented through addresses by representative women.</p><p xml:id="era2_130708">Although this matter of a convention has been talked over for some time, the subject has been precipitated by a letter to England, written by a southern editor, and reflecting upon the moral character of all colored women; this letter is too indecent for publication, but a copy of it is sent with this call to all the women's bodies throughout the country.

Colonel Dargan is indeed a rara avis --a secessionist, a confederate officer, with every interest in the south, he is now a fearless champion of justice and free speech. Considering the sentiment upon which he has been reared, his comments upon the approaching constitutional convention and the iniquity of the attempt to disenfranchise the black race are remarkable for their fearlessness. The south is very boastful of the bravery of its sons. Here is an example of genuine bravery. That it is so conspicuous shows the rarity of the true article in that portion of the country.</p><p xml:id="era2_130714">Let the good work go on in the meantime.

Jack, president of the Missouri Press Association. The letter of Mr. Jack to Miss Belgarnie is a denouncement of the morality of the colored women of America, and also a criticism of the peculiar ideas of virtue and morality held by everybody but the people of the south and west. Miss Belgarnie forwards the letter for publication in the ERA, with an expression of sympathy and indignation for the slurs we, as colored women, are subjected to. As the charges in this letter are so sweeping and so base, we have decided not to act hastily upon it, but to be very careful in our method of bringing it before the public. Our line of action has already begun; the letter will be printed and forwarded to leading men and women and heads of educational institutions, particularly in the south, people of reputation and standing, whose words carry weight; and in the next issue it is hoped to print the charge, with these signed replies.</p><p xml:id="era2_130716">The matter is a solemn one, and one upon which we shall call all our women all over the country to act.

Not a more applicable title could be suggested for the time of completion of the college curriculum than Commencement, for those leaving its walls have been trained to gather discreetly the grains of knowledge, and they are therefore sent out to engage in the great army in defnce of truth and right. They go with the problem yet to be solved--education the unknown quantity, works of great educators, perseverance and diligence represent the known quantities.</p><p xml:id="era2_130718">The solution of this problem is not accomplished in a lifetime. Those who give a proper estimate to the value of an education will rather rejoice that the end of learning to them is very much the same as the end of the rainbow to a little child, the longer he tries to find it the farther it seems to be from him.</p><p xml:id="era2_130719">The effect of the research may be disappointment and discouragement for the child, while the true student is enthused by the knowledge that the more the obstacles he conquers in his onward march the higher he places himself on the ladder which reaches perfection.

and developed, must be searched and weighed, reserving such as cause the mind to expand and reach out for other facts, in order to strengthen and build strong intellects. Students should endeavor to grow strong intellectually, so as not to be cast about by every attempt on the part of opposers to revolutionize well-founded theories, but by careful study so fortify themselves on the subjects as to become stronger advocates of the right. Diligence is the price of success, so no student needs be lacking in the material by which to acquire knowledge. One important point should be borne in mind, viz., the acquirement of an education, in the limited sense of the term, does not depend upon the number of books read nor the variety of literature, but upon the thorough study and digestion of the most important subjects by authors of worth and literary standing.</p><p xml:id="era2_130724">The discontinuance of attendance in a school, after having completed the prescribed course of study in that institution, does not signify that the mental powers have become thoroughly developed and the education completed.</p><p xml:id="era2_130725">Oh, no!  it means the <hi rend="italic">commencement</hi>.</p><p xml:id="era2_130726">The Virginia Baptist State Convention met in Suffolk, Va., May 9, 1895, and continued during that week.

Washington in his address before the students of Fisk University; and even at the risk of being considered an echo, we must repeat that industrial training through its resultant skilled labor has been for every race, and will be for the Negro race, the most potent force in its development.</p><p xml:id="era2_130732">It has required years for the "industrial idea" in education to stamp itself upon the educational system of America, and we question whether the impress is yet sufficiently deep; but financial crises, the continuous influx of foreign skilled labor, and the losses sustained by the American laborer, if he is not equally skillful, are creating forceful demonstrations of the necessity for practical training in this direction. Afro-American labor is not foreign labor in the sense usually implied by this term; and in past decades it was a mainspring in developing the resources of a new country. In those years, the artisans of the South, the skilled laborers, as matters then stood, were colored men, and the inventive genius then exemplified by individual members of the race, even under those exceedingly unfavorable environments, furnish proof of our inherent creative capacity; and when at last the doors of school and college were opened to the descendants of these mechanics, had the industrial idea been as firmly engrafted upon the American system of education as at present, the future prospect of these comparatively young people would be brighter than it now is, for the trained hand must keep pace with the trained mind in order to be able to express the conceptions of the mind in material form.</p><p xml:id="era2_130733">Says Dr. Coffin, in an editorial appearing in the April <hi rend="italic">A.M.E.

But attention is now being turned and we think wisely, too, toward the workshop."</p><p xml:id="era2_130736">We are indebted to inventive genius for all the means of rapid transit, expeditious communication, the product of remote sections, the comforts in home, hotel and shop, the means of social and intellectual gratification which render life in the nineteenth century so far above all preceding centuries. In this march of progress, a few important inventions have originated in the brain of a Negro, but we must work more strenuously to stimulate the creative faculty, if we would maintain a permanent hold upon civilization in America or elsewhere. We must seize with avidity upon the industrial factors of education. Especially do our little ones need the industrial features of the kindergarten; and when parents and teachers fully realize this fact, then, from its earliest years, the child will be taught to contrast and to invent articles according to scientific principles. We do not, indeed, need a smaller number of scholarly men and women, but a much larger quota of those who to their literary attainments add the power to produce something which is a necessity to the masses. We need not less intellectual training in the field of higher education, but more practical education.</p><p xml:id="era2_130737">The young colored man who graduated from Lawrence University, Kansas, and then went, to his farm and settled down to solid work with the remark, "If the white race need scientific farmers, surely my race does," has solved the "race problem" for himself, and has furnished an example which many individuals can afflord to emulate. With pride from year to year we read that the "Potato King" of the Missouri Valley is a colored man; a man who by reducing the production of the tuber to a scientific process is bringing forth from his acres both fame and fortune--capital, that commodity which added to a better knowledge of investing it, is so great a necessity in the present stage of our development. The Afro-American of the United States is for various reasons behind his brother in the more advanced of the South American states in the acquisition of wealth, and therefore in the development of those enterprises which require the outlay of large amounts of capital. We are not particularly interested in trust companies, mining plants and grinding monopolies, although, from the force of habit, we read of and discuss them; but we have little capital invested in those lines. In the South, as an agricultural laborer, the Negro is a great industrial factor; but not until he owns the cotton and rice fields, the turpentine orchards and cane plantations in which he now labors, can he be considered in any sense a controling factor of the South; nor can we hope to take front rank in any department of civilized life until we are part and parcel of large industries.</p><p xml:id="era2_130738">Thus far in our career we may justly be accused of a quality which George Eliot styles "other worldliness." We need more of an eye to the main chance; or as Carnegie is said to have put it when, looking at a young man's collection of coins, "A very good thing to have in its way, a very good thing; but I tell you, young man, the coin to look out for is the American dollar."</p><p xml:id="era2_130739">Every Negro inventor of high rank, every scientific farmer, artisan, or tradesman, takes a long step ahead for his race, since the world is clamoring for proofs of our capacity, originality, and culture; hence the industrial schools should be intensely practical and filled to overflowing with our young people; for it matters not whether the Negro deciides to remain here, or migrate elsewhere, always and everywhere will he find this problem of scientific and industrial training confronting him, and, unless he learns to solve it under all of its conditions, possible and probable, will find himself a negative quality.  The South needs skilled laborers to develop her valuable resources, Mexico, South America and Africa the same; and the brainy men of each section, or country, will diligently seek until the find the laborer best qualified for the work; obviously then, the colored man need not run from the conditions which he finds in the United States, and unless he possesses superior industrial training may as well take his chances here as elsewhere.  A recent writer from Africa to the <hi rend="italic">New York Age</hi> states that those Afro-Americans who come to colonize in Africa should be civil engineers, mechanics, practical farmers, etc., and should bring capital with them. In other words, they should be of the order of colonists that brought about the most safisfactory results in the colonization of America, Australia, India, and the Islands of the Sea.</p><p xml:id="era2_130741">The simple act of departing for "Africa, the home of our fathers," is not sufficient to secure even a foothold in a country already largely under the control of the English, French, Belgians, Germans, Italians, Portuguese and Turks, each

pressing to the utmost the development of the immense riches to which they have laid claim; each desirous of building up colonies toward which they desire to attract the surplus of their population; and looking the facts squarely in the face, it seems highly probable, that the African in Africa, like the Indian in America, will soon be dispossessed of his own soil. Is there not a possible remedy for the ills which confront us here, there and everywhere, in practical industrial training?</p><floatingText xml:id="era2_130745"><body xml:id="era2_130743"><p xml:id="era2_130742"><hi rend="italic">Good words for the</hi>ERA.--I received the copies of the ERA  and like it more and more.

The necessary outward influences--warmth, air, light and moisture--have caused it to grow harmoniously.</p><p xml:id="era2_130749">The question arises as to whether the growth and expansion of the "Woman Suffrage Plant" is commensurate with that in the natural world.</p><p xml:id="era2_130750">That three women were sent to act as legislators is in advance of the old regime. These women representatives have shown a progressive spirit in the measures they have advocated. Mrs. Holly introduced eleven bills, Mrs. Klock, three, and Mrs. Cressingham, four.</p><p xml:id="era2_130751">Two of Mrs. Cressingham's bills are designed to promote the sugar beet industry. "She believes in the possibilities of the sugar beet.

In some of the southern counties of the state, Spanish was the language used in the schools. Her bill provides that English shall be the language in all public schools. Her last bill was for the creation of a "state board for the arbitration of controversies arising between employer and employee."</p><p xml:id="era2_130753">The Hon. Frances Klock, also of Arapahoe, presented "House joint memorial No. 6," asking Congress  "to grant the military reservation known as Fort Lyon to the state of Colorado for the purpose of establishing a soldiers' home at that place," the present home at Monte Vista being very undesirable.</p><p xml:id="era2_130754">Her second bill provides for the support of the state home and industrial school for girls. Her last bill deals with the same matter, but states in detail how the home is to be managed. All the officers and assistants shall be women excepting one member of the board.</p><p xml:id="era2_130755">Representative Holly of Pueblo, has the honor of being the first woman to introduce a bill in the house -- "the age of consent bill." One bill is a constitutional amendinent, and amends a certain section of an article which now permits a foreigner to vote upon declaring his intention to become a citizen. The proposed amendment enfranchises every person (instead of every male person) over the age of twenty-one years, provided, first, that "he or she shall be a citizen of the United States." And second, that "he or she shall be able to read the constitution in the English language."</p><p xml:id="era2_130756">A third bill also deals with the election laws. A fourth, refers to school matters. A fifth, affects the property of unmarried men who die without wills. Their possessions did revert to the father; this bill asks that such property be evenly divided between the parents of the deceased. A sixth asked cases concerning the validity of wills and testaments be placed at the head of the docket. Two other bills provide for the punishment of persons guilty of enticing boys or girls under twenty-one years into places of ill repute. A ninth bill provides for a truant officer. The tenth, concerns divorce and alimony.</p><p xml:id="era2_130758">"You will laugh at my last bill, for it is kind

The moment we enter the world of books that moment a great <hi rend="italic">personal</hi>responsibility rests upon us.  It is as necessary that we choose as wisely the companionship of books as we do the companionship of friends.  There is an old proverb, "A man may usually be known by the company he keeps," but he can just as truly be known by the books he reads.</p><p xml:id="era2_130767">No kinder or wiser friend can one have than a good book, for a book which is worthy for us to take as a companion is the embodiment of the noblest thoughts of which that life was capable.</p><pb xml:id="era2_130768" n="14  THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_130769">"You get into society in the widest sense," said Dr. Geikie, "in a great library, with the huge advantage of needing no introductions and not dreading repulses. From that great crowd you can choose what companions you please, for in these silent levees of the immortals there is no pride, but the highest is at the service of the lowest with a great humility. You may speak freely with any without a thought of your inferiority, for books are perfectly well-bred and hurt no one's feelings by any discriminations."</p><p xml:id="era2_130770">Great care should be taken in cultivating the habit of reading, for without reading it is impossible to ever be the "full man" of whom Lord Bacon tells us. It is no more reasonable to suppose we will have bright ideas and noble thoughts without reading "than to suppose that the Mississippi might roll on its flood of waters to the ocean, though all its tributary streams were cut off and it were replenished only by occasional drops from the clouds." We are told that the elder Pliny seldom sat down to eat a meal without insisting upon some one reading to him, and that so close and constant was Petrarch's application to his books that, his friends became anxious about his health, and through love to him refused to allow him to enter his study for ten days, and by the morning he was ill with fever; his keys were at once restored to him, and with them came his usual health and bright spirits.</p><p xml:id="era2_130771">Not only is it necessary to acquire the habit of reading, but also the habit of selecting carefully what we read, and this in itself will greatly develop our intellectual tendency, and then we will learn to appreciate the good and beautiful.

Mr. Edward S. Glover's well appointed residence was the scene of the festivities. The young ladies, attired in handsome evening costumes, from the depths of luxurious chairs and under mellow lights, witnessed the one-act play and the burlesque dancing that followed, a noteworthy feature of which was the <hi rend="italic">pas seul</hi> of Mr.. Edward Glover, who, by the way, is especially good in theatrical imitations. Mr. Sam Marsh, fresh from the stage, having appeared in the performance of Leah at the Hollis Street Theater a day or two before, also made some clever hits in his acting. Appo Johnson appeared as Trilby, and some topical songs, in costume, ended the program. An elaborate banquet followed. The table decorations were in green, and the effect was enhanced by the reflection from the pale green shades that dimmed the light of the numerous small candles. Toasts were drank and souvenir stick pins were presented to the ladies. The presentation speech was responded to by Miss Lillian Lewis, in behalf of the Vaudeville Club.</p><p xml:id="era2_130780">The tea given to the members of the Vaudeville Club, at which Misses Libbie Watson and Carrie Patterson were the hostesses, wound up the brilliant series of entertainments that have given so much pleasure to society folk, young and old, the past season. Miss Watson's pretty home in Dorchester was thrown open for the occasion, and the evening was spent in a delightfully informal manner, the tea being the special feature. The cosy dining room was tastefully decorated and the repast included a long menu of tempting and dainty viands.</p><pb xml:id="era2_130781" n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_130782">Hon.

LA FIESTA DE LOS ANGELES.</head><docAuthor>S. Willie Layton.</docAuthor><byline>S.Willie Layton, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_130805">The Lenten days are indeed past, and for one week this fair city of the South has become the realm of La Reina de La Fiesta. The city government is overthrown, and the reign of the Sovereign of Flowers and Fun is ushered in with blares of tin trumpets, jangling bells and shrill whistles. Decorations are gorgeous--the city color mad--from electric light poles and wires lazily flap the tricolored flags of gold, scarlet and olive, (emblematic of the orange, wine and olive productions of our state). Children scamper along the streets, like tropical birds, in their frocks of blended gold, scarlet and olive; carriages and tallyhos, tandem and cart are bright and gay with garlands and ribbons. From windows and steeples flutter the La Fiesta colors; street cars breaking into gay bunting become fanciful things of locomotion; horses prance proudly in their gay trimmings; and forlorn indeed is the dog that sports neither tri-colored collar or bow. The streets are thronged with merrymakers; every woman out in her new and fetching Easter bonnet and gown, so
<pb xml:id="era2_130804" n="17 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
absorbed in the spirit of La Fiesta, that she is not aware of the "mash" her big sleeve is making with the dirty car greaser who selfishly crowds her to get a peep at the queen's retainers; the pale face, without the least fear of the scalping knife, stands beside the Indian brave gaudily arrayed in feathers and paint; in the crowd sociably hurries the fat grey-gowned friar, beside the very red and horned devil; sweet Margarite's sensitive nostrils do not consider obtrusive the musty-scented Chinamen just crawled from the opium den; the "new woman," as usual, carricatured by her jealous brother, is present in gorgeous tri-colored blouse and bloomers; the fraternity of street fakirs, yelling "La Fiesta badges," is patronized by the sailors and country cousins who have "come to take in Fiesta"; dominoes of all colors and designs mingle with the fashionable and ordinarily dressed Angelenos. The pageants of the first two days represetned the history and religion of the Pacific coast, then followed floats depicting early California history, typical Spanish life made quite real by the presence of genuine senoritas and a company of typical and gallant caballeros on prancing steeds; next followed grand displays of commercial and mercantile interests, which could but feebly portray the enterprise, recourses and productions of southern California. The third day the school children paid to La Reina (and proud was Los Angeles as column after column of bright faced boys and girls swept through the streets;) such a spectacle of comeliness and intelligent prophecy no city can outrival. We sighed, again in vain, "Oh for the fount of youth." Other cities can display their soldiers, their expert horsemen, their fire apparatus, even their Chinamen, but the locality that can produce so complete an array of excellence in all these lines as displayed on Military day, would be hard to find. The Chinese portion was brilliant and picturesque, and will go down into history as the most striking success of La Fiesta, '95. Their barbaric splendor was imposing because it was genuine--a great moving living picture of historical events from the land of Confucius, dating back 2000 years, with real accessories from the Asiatic birth place, depicted by the people therefrom. There were glittering banners and helmets wrought in fantastic shapes, baggy silk trousers of sky blue, terminating in stockings of sea green, pink and white; heralding this were the diabolic strains of the Chinese orchestra, tom toms, and clanking of forty tin kettles and the shrieking rasp of the Chinese fiddles. Not a thread of cheap gaudy tinsel marred their glittering display. The exquisite embroidery and bullion fringe would have stood examination severe, it was every thread solid gold and silver metal; the gay, silken garments and banners were of the richest texture and material. Their high officials deigned not to handle a bridle, but rode horses led by white men, so richly attired were they it made the eye ache to look upon them; their garments were a mass of golden embroidery. This page of Oriental splendor had dropped bodily down into the busy bustling western world. The coolie exclaims, "Hip fine allee same melican show no good." The concluding function of La Fiesta was the floral display, a fragrant and beautiful success. The show a fairy dream. The triumphal progress of the perfumed pageant left in its wake a coating of crushed roses and carnations on the street pavements.  Pretty! Ah yes, it was something more than pretty, our plain language is too poor to express it--simply an outward and visible token of the inward and spiritual grace.</p><p xml:id="era2_130806">Among the most interesting events of the past month was the meeting of the Southern Calilornia branch of the Woman's Press Association in Los Angeles.

But there are dressmakers and dressmakers, just as there are teachers and teachers, and those who have not mastered all the intricacies of their trade will be forced to the wall. Learn a trade, but by all means learn it well; be an expert in your chosen profession, and patronage will be thrust upon you from all quarters.</p><p xml:id="era2_130816">I see that some of the cities have already appointed their committees and gone to work to get up an exhibit for the Cotton States Exposition, which will be a credit to the Lone Star State. This is a move in the right direction.</p><p xml:id="era2_130817">Those who do not wish to take part should not try to hinder or disparage the efforts of the committees. Of course things are not exactly as we would like--there are some objectionable features; but, we shall accomplish no good by standing aloof complaining, when there has been offered to us such at glorious opportunity to show to the world that we can do something.</p><p xml:id="era2_130818">People pay no attention to a man who says, "I can invent a machine;" but let him step forward bearing his invention in his hands, and say, "I invented this," he at once attracts their attention, and if it is really worth anything, their respect also.</p><p xml:id="era2_130819">Ours is the age in which work and not talk accomplishes the most good. The Caucasian sees so little of us, and very often that little our worst side, that he is amazed at the idea of one of us accomplishing anything worthy of his notice.</p><p xml:id="era2_130820">We have some brains in Texas; now let us utilize them in getting together such an exhibit as shall make the Texas Department of the Negro Building at Atlanta the cynosure for all visitors.</p><p xml:id="era2_130821">If we can demonstrate the fact that we call invent anything, mould a piece of statuary or write a book as well as anyone, then we shall do more to solve the negro problem than all preaching and complaining can do? Can we not do this?</p><p xml:id="era2_130822">Mr. Carlisle, our state superintendent, has consented to establish a summer normal of high grade for colored teachers this year.  It is something of which all true teachers have felt the need, and we should show our appreciation by attending in large numbers.</p><p xml:id="era2_130823">Mr. Kealing's name has been proposed as a conductor, and if he is appointed, we are all quite convinced that, with his ability and experience, he cannot fail to make it a success.</p><p xml:id="era2_130824">As the Teachers' Association meets in Austin just at that time, the superintendent would do well to locate the normal there, as it would save teachers who wished to attend the expense of another railroad fare. Let us urge that city for the normal.</p><p xml:id="era2_130825">The citizens of Austin are making strenuous efforts to give the teachers who attend a Teachers' Convention a hearty welcome. It is to be hoped that all who can possibly attend will do so. We are very anxious to have the meeting a success, but when more than half of the great army of teachers never attend, it certainly gives others a bad impression of us. We should be more interested in our own association. Make a few sacrifices if need be.</p><p xml:id="era2_130826">Three of our educational institutes closed their doors last month--Hearne Academy, Wiley and Paul Quinn. All have very interesting programs.</p><p xml:id="era2_130827">Prairie View Normal will close on the 7th of June. Bishop Lee will deliver the address to graduates and Rev. L. L.

Gould.</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_130828">There has been little published lately that is interesting and entertaining, or, in other words, popular; which is a good thing.  For if we are continually deluged with so much current literature, that it is really worth one's while to read, when are we to find time for our old favorite authors? For those books that, however old, never cease to be new ? That can be read and read again, and in each reading we can discover new beauties and learn new lessons of life?</p><pb xml:id="era2_130829" n="19 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_130830">By the way, did anyone ever consider what a dangerous thing it was to recommend a book, a thing we do so often and so carelessly? "Tell me something good to read," and you name the first interesting book that comes in your mind, not considering to what sort of a person you are speaking. Every book we read leaves an impression on the mind of some sort, but does not often impress two people in the same way. Often the book that may strengthen the weak places in the character of one, may have an opposite effect in that of another. Any book that is fascinating, or, indeed, at all interesting must appeal directly to some trait, taste, sympathy, or experience of the reader. Therefore it is well to consider the apparent characteristics of the friend to whom we commend a book; and we should be careful, also, lest we leave an erroneous impression of our own character by our tastes.</p><p xml:id="era2_130831">This has been called the reign of the paperbound book. Time was when it was considered the spurious article, but nowadays everything comes in paper from Ruskin, Huxley, and Drummond to "The Dark and Daring Deeds of Dick Deadeye," et cetera.  So "you pays your money and you takes your choice." Now if you send to John B. Allen, publisher, 10 and 12 Underwater Street, New York, for his catalogue you will get a list of books quoted at prices ranging from two cents upwards. These are remarkably well printed on good firm paper. The list consists of the world's best books and embraces biography, history, science and poetry, as well as the standard novels.</p><p xml:id="era2_130832">Here in Boston we have had Trilby indeed.

The hard and intelligent work put into the effort by the committee of ladies deserved to win for them the financial returns hoped for. About two hundred people went out. It required many times that number to meet the desire of the committee, which was to raise enough money by the picnic to keep the home open through the summer season, when most of its friends and donors are away from the city.

Such an attack on womankind as his, so noisome and foul, is merciless in marking to the world the standard of man that the Missouri State Press Club has seen fit to elect as its presiding officer. He has not only slandered the women of negro extraction, but the mothers of American morality and virtue, when he says in his letter to the Hon. Florence Balgarnic: "Until such literature as your society (anti-lynching) sends out made an impression, and until northern women came along with their degraded views of chastity of women," etc., etc. Let reasonable minds ask what this means.  It it plain that it begins with the negro woman, but let reason say where it ends. "Until the northern people came among us with their degraded views of chastity of women"!  Where do Maria Lydia Childs, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Fanny Kemble, Harriet Martineaux, and hundreds of others who in pure lofty womanhood upheld the moralists of the nineteenth century--the abolitionists--stand in this Iewd fellow's sweeping statement? When truth-loving minds understand and acknowledge that the thing in slavery which destroyed the peace of mind of the ever-to-be-appreciated northern woman was in toto the demoralizing effect of the institution slavery on each succeeding generation--when this is considered, the only conclusion is a boundless pity for the depravity that flagrantly vents itself on the self-sacrificing labors of <hi rend="italic">the</hi> women who taught <hi rend="italic">southern men</hi>what chastity meant!</p><p xml:id="era2_130987">While no sane person will accept any statement of morals on such general lines as this individual

has outlined, and while it is repellant in every way to the chaste mind to dignify such foul thoughts and expressions by a public refutation, yet allegiance to virtue leaves but one course open, to warn the indifferent against permitting such an one as this man Jacks must be to think and speak for them. I mean particularly the Press Club of Missouri. While it is not to be expected that any good effect can be made by our utterances on the class that the defamer represents, yet the courageous women should speak through the WOMAN's ERA that the world may feel the power of the chaste mentality of the true negro woman. At least, this is no time to treat a vilifier in the manner only comprehended by a true man. As consistent women, jealous of our good name, we should not hesitate through mistaken ideas as to wise policy, etc., in. sending broadcast our burning contempt for any creature who can assail with viperous touch a subject that involves the innate mystery of hidden life out of our reverence for those who preceded us, made a place in history, song and story for us. Our indignation should know no limit. We as women have been too unobtrusive, too little known; we have been hidden by our close adherence to high endeavor. The dross has forced to the front too long.  We should realize, and let the world know that we realize it, that America, and the south in particular, owes a deathless bond of gratitude to the now slandered class, that the fair sons and daughters of the south were not corrupted or demoralized during their young and tender years. This is no shallow claim. History can be out in evidence to prove that decency existed most generally among the negro women of the south, for they only were forced by iron law and brutish control to live under the harrowing conditions by the chivalric (?) progenitors of possibly Jacks and his class. If there were enough negro women found at that time to whom the tender youth was entrusted, not only for training at the very time of life when the moral character pre-eminently is formed, but for nourishing the same, which is an indisputable fact, what claim to truth can Jacks and his class hope to establish by such malignant charges as are published in his letter to a noble English lady?</p><p xml:id="era2_130988">No man capable of reverencing his mother, or protecting the unsullied fame of any woman, would have written or forwarded such a communication to any woman; much less, one whose life work entitles her to the respect at least of progressive and wholesome minds, regardless of sex,  wherever principle and unselfish efforts to uplift struggling humanity exists.</p><p xml:id="era2_130989">The Woman's Loyal Union will do all in its power to support the position taken by the Woman's Era Club of Boston in calling upon the women of the race to meet in convention.

If successful, the organized bodies of women throughout the country will note it, and their respect for us as a body will rise correspondingly; thereby an advance will have been accomplished.  The brightest of our women should come together, for regardless of success or failure, it will afford an opportunity not only of educating public opinion as to our status as women, but will be a test of the broadmindedness an zeal in the matter of mutual advancement existing between the women of the races.  If the women will only read and think this manner over, we will have no fears as to the ultimate result.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_04.04" type="Article"><head rend="center">WASHINGTON.</head><docAuthor>Mary Church Terrell</docAuthor><byline>MARY CHURCH TERRELL, EDITOR.</byline><floatingText xml:id="era2_130991"><body xml:id="era2_130990"><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">O that I could express in words,</l><l>very emotion that I feel, </l><l>And sweeter than the song of birds</l><l>Each of my hidden thoughts reveal.</l><l>Within my soul they're fettered fast,</l><l>Although they long to be released,</l><l>And nobly struggle, till at last, </l><l>From vain endeavors they have ceased.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">Then as a caged bird sings, tho' bound,</l><l>Still caroling its sweet refrain,</l><l>So in my soul, though bars surround,</l><l>My thoughts sing forth their sweetest strain.</l></lg></body></floatingText><p xml:id="era2_130994">Two women engaged in an interesting dicussion which I overheard the other day.

tion to be settled was whether it is wiser for the average Afro-American to be so politic as to avoid antagonizing Anglo-Saxons by dissenting from their opinions, or whether he should boldly assert himself, when the occasion arises, and have the courage of his convictions.</p><p xml:id="era2_130995">"I believe that the reason why we make no more progress in securing our various rights is because all of us, men and women, are too weakkeoed," said a fiery little sister, fairly bristling with independence and earnestness. "Some of our most intelligent men counsel such allopathic doses of diplomacy in dealing with their brothers in white as to cure forever the tendency either to challenge accusations or resent insults offered by them. As long as we submit quietly just so long will the apostles of oppression and tyranny continue to insult and abuse us. According to my opinion, we have been too long-suffering and have given too little evidence of possessing back bone.  Patience ceases to be a virtue after it reaches a certain limit, and too much so-called christian submission is the virtue either of cowards or fools, I believe," she continued, boiling more and more with indignation as she proceeded.</p><p xml:id="era2_130996">'"Well, what do you advise, for instance?" said a level-headed woman whose pulse beat at least twenty times less in a minute than that of her friend.  "You would have our men go through the world with a chip on their shoulder, I suppose, offering fight to all Anglo-Saxons who differ with them. A more hair-brained course could not be imagined, because it would fall so far short of accomplishitig the end at which you aim. Policy and diplomacy will effect more than pugnacity as we are situated at present, according to my opinion."</p><p xml:id="era2_130997">"I do not advise going to extremes in asserting ourselves and maintaining our manhood," said the little advocate of resistance. "I want our intelligent men to be more ready to resent insults and stand up for the rights that are denied. I want lo see them less willing to preserve the silence they call "golden" when a word of manly independence and righteous indignation would raise them so much higher in the estimation of themselves and everybody else. We need to cultivate self-respect as a race. From the very nature of the case we have too little of that in our composition. The fact that it is not our fault that we lack this prerequisite to a dignified manhood and womanhood does not alter or help the matter. The effect upon ourselves is just as fatal in every particular. I want to see men of spirit possessing too much self respect to play the role of cowardice under the cloak of diplomacy. I want to see the number of men not afraid to denounce wrong increasing."</p><p xml:id="era2_130998">"That is all very well from a theoretical standpoint," said she of the slow pulse and the cool head, "but practically such a course would be suicidal to the progress of the race, as I look at it. We are as yet too dependent upon the masters of the situation to strike the attitude of defiance. We need money above everything else before we are in a position to make demands effectually. Such a bold expression of opinion as you advise would simply mean less of position to the average Afro-American who indulged in this pastime to any great extent. Here in Washington, for instance, some of our brainiest men are in the employ of the government, and their lips must be sealed when it comes to fault finding or denouncing wrongs inflicted by the dominant race. Our men of intelligence, who are for the most part independent of spirit, frequently refrain from taking an active part in the war against oppression because such a course would deprive them of means of subsistence. They do not want to take bread out of the mouths of their families, and so they keep silent."</p><p xml:id="era2_130999">This state of things is indeed discouraging," said the little Joan of Arc, "for it is a species of slavery more galling to men and women who have tasted freedom than to those who have never known the joys of liberty. But I do not believe that an exhibition of bold, fearless manhood in the race would result so disastrously as you imagine. Even tyrants admire courage in the victims of their oppression. If our men displayed more pluck and independence in their dealings with the Anglo-Saxon brothers the latter would have more respect for them. We can never command respect from others until we possess a sufficient quantity ourselves, and no man or woman can respect himself or herself who dares not stand up for what he or she conceives to be right. In the struggle for complete liberty some body must be sacrificef. If each one considers only what will be to his advantage as an individual, and is subservient because it will advance his personal interests, I doubt seriously that we shall ever attain that dignity and independence as a people without which we can amount to nothing."</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301000" n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/></div><div xml:id="era2_04.05" type="Social_Notes"><head rend="center">ILLINOIS.</head><docAuthor>Fannie Barrier Williams</docAuthor><byline>FANNIE BARRIER WILLIAMS, EDITOR.</byline><p xml:id="era2_1301001">The July number of the ERA will find many of our readers among the teaching class in the cool retreats of their vacation season.  To no class of workers is a brief respite from service so happily welcome.  In their eagerness for this grateful season of change from the worries and bad air of the school room to the open air of freedom and exhilaration many of our teachers give but little attention to the best means of spending this vacation time.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301002">Of course, I would not attempt to give either instruction or advice as to how the vacation period ought to be spent. This is a matter of individual determination to be governed largely by circumstances. It is interesting, however, to note and understand what important changes are going on in the popular mind with reference to the use of summer vacations. While railroad and steamboats are doing everything in the line of improvement in traveling facilities, and while the watering places are all wonderfully joyous in the things that delight soul and body, there has been a steady growth in in popular favor of the summer schools, and other assemblies for intellectual recreation.  Many of the great universities and centers of learning have become popular summer resorts for the increasing thousands who find no rest and strength in idleness or dissipation of time.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301003">These summer schools are largely in the nature of lecture courses and embrace a wide range of studies that in many cases are in the nature of post-graduate work. The most eminent men and women in all departments of human knowledge are engaged in this new department of education. The Chicago, Madison, Lake Forest and Michigan universities are notable among western Schools for the thoroughness and extensiveness of their summer work for 1895.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301004">The prospects of attendance from all parts of this country and Canada are exceedingly encouraging to the cause of education. Many eminent men from the universities of the older world have been secured for the summer course of Chicago university, and teachers and others who are eager to hear the authoritative word from the original thinkers of the day would do well to avail themselves of these rare opportunities.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301005">It is to he hoped that large numbers of our southern teachers will feel inclined and be able to refresh themselves with these larger inspirations of vacation season. People in the North can help the cause of education in the South to a considerable extent by affording a hospitable welcome to such of our overworked and underpaid sisters in the South who come North to drink from these fresh founts of inspiration and high knowledge.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301006">Exhilaration of soul, as well as a renewal of physical strength should be the aim of the men and women who for two or three months are released from the service of teaching. To thus enlarge the boundaries of the mind mean as much to the schools as to themselves.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301007">It is a long time since Chicago has been in such a tip toe of eagerness over social events.  The announcement of June Weddings has fairly taken us off our feet with their startling surprises.  The approaching marriage of Miss Ida B. Wells to Mr. F.L. Barnett has an interest that exceeds all local  bounds.  The public has become so interested in the unique career of Miss Wells that her determination to marry a man while still married to a cause will be a topic of national interest and comment.  The public has been so accustomed to think of Miss Wells' remarkable zeal for the cause of law and order that, I suppose, no one ever reads a case of lynching without associating with it the indignant protest of our plucky little friend.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301008">Aside from being an attorney of established reputation at the Chicago bar, the fortunate groom has manifested a chivalric interest in the cause of his estimable bride.  All Chicago unite in blessing the matrimonial union of two persons whose most conspicuous traits of character have been an unstinted interest in the cry for help and justice from an unfortunate people.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301009">The I.B.W.

happiness in marrying a fine type of the new generation of colored gentlemen.  Mr. Roberts is a recent graduate of the Chicago law school and is a high-minded, capable and companionable gentleman.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301012">These June marriages chime in quite fittingly with the gladsome festivities of these school closing days. They both lend a joyous zest to this season of congratulation and good will. It is the season of flowers, music, bright expectations and love's triumphs.

Her ancestors were Abolitionists, her childhood's home was on the line of  "the underground railway" for fleeing fugitive slaves; her father was one of the founders of the Free Soil, afterwards the Republican party; and her convictions and sympathies as proved by her speeches, books and editorial articles are with those who from the beginning of the great anti-slavery agitation have been devoted to the cause of the colored people.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301016">As president of the National W.C.T.U. and founder of the World's W.C.T.U., Miss Willard has always maintained the position that no colored line could be drawn by either society, and the women who have thus far guided and controlled these great national organizations have never sought to establish any distinction in either, but have freely and gladly accepted the colored women as officers and delegates to the convention of both. Within a few weeks Miss Willard publicly declared that if a certain woman's club of Chicago, of which she is a member, declined to receive colored women on terms of equality, she should resign her membership.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301017">The National W.C.T.U. is organized on the basis that each state has a right to manage its own internal affairs. In some of the southern states, colored unions have heen formed with the hearty concurrence of leading colored women. When these unions send their delegates to the World's or National W.C.T.U., they are received on terms of perfect equality with white women. It is due to the white ribbon movement that this statement be widely made and thoroughly understood, as the work of that society is one of wide range and womanly beneficence. In view of these facts we feel that for any person or persons to give currency to statements harmful to Miss Willard as a reformer is most misleading and unjust. Through her influence many of the state unions have adopted resolutions against lynching, and the National union has put itself squarely on record in the same way, while the annual addresses of the president plainly indicated her disapproval of such lawless and barbarous proceedings.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301018">[Signed]</p><signed><name>FREDERICK DOUGLASS,</name><name>WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON,</name><name>FRANCIS J.

Anthony and Rev. Anna H. Shaw,  who had crossed the continent to meet with the second Woman's Congress of California. It was said by some of the "legal-minded men" that the subject ("Home") under consideration this year was not broad enough in scope and would prove tame. After the subject had beon discussed politically by Miss Anthony and Rev. Shaw, and by the other brainy women who considered it from domestic, social, evolutionary or hygienic standpoints, the men--not even conservative Rabbi Voorsanger of San Francisco--dared criticise the verdict of Mayor Sutro, "That there had assembled in Golden Gate hall an aristocracy higher than ever assembled in any place in Europe--an aristocracy of brains. Women have finer brain power than men and will improve government.  Let them step in and restore the patriotism of the revolutionary fathers and all will be well."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301043">It was apparent that the new woman was not to be distinguished by any frightful logic dress reform attire, neither was she bereft the divine and sweet influences that characterize the mother and wife.  The new woman, as she appeared in Golden Gate hall, demonstrated her intellectual fitness and cleverly proved herself able to use her brain and appear attractive, for said the press,  "Oh, this is no Woman's Congress, this is some sort of swell reception." Yet her personal appearance was secondary to the vital question under discussion. If brains quickened with progressive thought, balanced by sound judgment, enthusiasm, crowded halls, from which has gone forth an impetus for greater effort in the elevation of woman and humanity, if these are indications of success, then this Woman's Congress was a success.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301044">The presence and practical talks of Mrs. Stephen Matthews (known at the Woman's Congress as the little English woman with the big voice) has inspired to action the colored women of this place.

The possibilities are large for a grand work by this club, the women are of the class teeming with enthusiasm and bright thought and lots of "stick ability."

The school board is divided, the superintendent's situation challenged, common sense requesting silence for the present from teachers, the citizens en masse for enlightenment, personalities so bitterly flung that as yet we don't know just where we are. It is to be hoped this very serious question of education may be wisely and carefully considered. Let the individual system have fair and impartial trial. If the present class system can be improved, teachers allowed opportunity for using a little more originality in giving unto each pupil his instruction as and when most needed, instead of the old way of cramming a prescribed course, mental capacity or none, such a system would be more helpful alike to teacher and pupil.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_04.09" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">OHIO.</head><docAuthor>Sada J.

Whatever her mental verdict may have been, her verbal criticism was "horrible."  If by venting this acrid term before her friend, she though to curb their eagerness to read De Maurier's fancy, when too late she learned that the wrong term was unhappily employed in condemning it.  Instead of serving the purpose she had intended, it "o'erleaps itself and falls on other."

To the contrary, I think, though the work is fraught with objectionable features-many--(by the way, that no girl of modest bearing would do well to imitate, unless, like Trilby,
<pb xml:id="era2_1301055" n="10 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
she err through ignorance) it carries, in the end, a moral of purity and innocence.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301057">Sheeted and sleeping in the grave's cold embrace are innumerable mothers, good, old-fashioned mothers, such as the world is in need of today. Not that there are fewer god mothers now than in times past, but that there are more corrupting influences abroad, abasing the minds, the hearts, the morals and manners of the times. Mothers were once not so foolishly ambitious of their daughter's social popularity as now. Instead of being precipitately paraded before public notice, the girls were wont to be kept in obscurity too long, so long as to engender a shyness and awkwardness difficult of riddance, when from their hiding they emerged.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301058">Then, in those dear, forever-gone days, girls were less prone to forwardness, less addicted to flattery and less susceptible to its seductive influences.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301059">When mothers were more watchful of their daughters' incoming and outgoing, more zealous, of the company kept, more observant of the haunts frequented, more careful of their manners and behavior, girls were more sincere and less deceptive.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301060">There was a time when young women would not, knowingly entertain young men who were morally, socially or intellectually their inferiors; but now, sad to say, the reverse is conspicuousily prevalent. In many places a man requires no family prestige, no brains, no money and--worse than all--no morals; nothing save a "gift of gab" and a stylish apparel to admit him into high and respected circles.  Poor requisites these for a man's entrance into the sanctity of our homes.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301061">It may be a sweeping assertion--an assertion born of ignorance, through inexperience of maternal duties, for one from whom God has withheld his greatest blessing, the blessing of becoming a mother--to make, nevertheless I charge you who have been so expressly favored, you who are mothers, with countenancing and abetting this deadly growing evil.  I charge you with neglect of your offspring's welfare.  I charge you with the good or bad qualities of which your child is possessed. It is not altogether the fiat of inheritance that a man must necessarily be profligate because his father was a libertine, or that a woman must need be the second edition of her mother's untowardness. By virtue of the power of blood, the tendency may exist--must exist, for blood will tell: it is sure to come out, if not in the present generation, in the next or the next; but as in nature it is possible to overcome the center-fleeing forces by the center-seeking, or <hi rend="italic"> vice versa</hi>, it is also possible by prayer, christian endeavor and christian determination to overcome the evil tendencies that are your child's inheritance. Mothers, vast, immeasurable, never-ending are your responsibilities; your nursery songs, your daily lessons, your words, your thoughts, your deeds, your walks, your maternal influences, all make or mar, elevate or degrade the child.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301062">The commencement exercises of the Austin High School, which took place at Staub's Theatre Friday, June 7, was, in the estimation of your correspondent, the best ever given by that school.

In a crisis, ability to see the right thing to do and courage to do it must command respect, at least for the effort. A crisis demanding a display of such qualities is upon us, and no plea of sensitiveness to making public slanderous insults can excuse the traduced from seeking vindication from unjust accusations, especially as these accusations are made and scattered broadcast.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301088">Will not longer pretending to igore these things look like either a tacit admission of their truth, or a fear to honestly face the charges so sweepingly made now? At the conference it is not proposed to make this refutation by boisterous denials of the accusations, but by earnest affirmations and showings of what we are, our aims, aspirations and hopes. The slanderous letter referred to in last month's ERA, while it has served as a spur to action in a matter long considered and frequently suggested in the ERA, will not be the keynote of the discussions of the whole conference. One session will be devoted to  "social purity" and what can be used as factors in promoting it. At that session the answers to inquiries sent out to prominent and reliable educators, and missioners among colored people, as to the moral conditions among these people as they find them, will be read. This subject should properly receive most careful and delicate handling, but with courage enough to compel condemnation of vice wherever it exists, and vindication for the innocent victims of a widespread slander.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_04.15.02" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">MISS WILLARD AND THE COLORED PEOPLE.</head><p xml:id="era2_1301089">In the Kansas department this month appears a circular letter explaining Miss Willard's position on the color question. The defence is timely, and it is a question if even now, since its publication, the majority of colored people will have their opinion that Miss Willard is a "temporizer" materially altered. The fact is, Miss Willard is at the head of a tremendous organization, and in that capacity and in order to keep everything and everybody harmonious, is obliged to be politic, and for the Welfare of the W.C.T.U. not to antagonize any section of this country.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301090">Doubtless Miss Willard is a good friend to colored people, but we have failed to hear from her or the W.

the whole spirit and motive, and frankly acknowledge that our chiefest concern is that Dr. Donald represents the growing spirit of the times--sympathy with the south and its methods, a growing belief in the inferiority of the negro, a disposition to put him down and back--these are the sentiments which are growing daily stronger in the North as well as the South. It is useless to blind ourselves to the fact that our position grows worse; we progress in education, in character and in the acquisition of money, but while in some cases these must tell, they do not bring that universal respect that they should. As long as identified with the race, the negro is regarded and treated as an inferior except in individual cases.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301095">The prospect could hardly be gloomier. South Carolina will doubtless disenfranchise the black man and very shortly restrict his educational privileges.

Then the teachers from the other schools would come and look on and eat ice cream and smile, remembering their past experience, or sigh, dreading the future.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301103">Southern University wound up in a brilliant display of musical glory.  The orchestras there, under Professor Nickerson's direction, are trying hard to rival the outside orchestras.  The baccalaureate sermon and commencement were revelations, especially the former, in scared music, and the possibilities of instruments in the hands of mere students. </p><p xml:id="era2_1301104">Another brilliant social as well as musical success was the promenade concert given by the Eddie Moore Conservatory committee July 1 at Loeper's Park.  The name Eddie Moore committee serves as a talisman always, and as about a thousand invitations had been issued, there was a great and generous crowd assembled.  Interspersing the dances, the Students' and Ida Club orchestra played classic overtures, as also dod the mandolin club.  So then, every one voted the affair a success in three ways, musical, social and financial.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301106">The Phyllis Wheatley Club held an interesting

meeting during the month. Some good papers were read, some good plans were discussed and some good reports received.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301107">N.B. The editors regret that they are obliged to leave until another issue an excellent paper by Miss Leila Moore of New Orleans on "How Women Read Newspapers."</p></div><div xml:id="era2_04.17" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">TEXAS.</head><docAuthor>Cora L. Smith</docAuthor><byline>CORA L. SMITH, EDITOR.</byline><p xml:id="era2_1301108">Texas, the largest state in the Union, has a most interesting history, one with which no other state can compare.  A stranger coming upon Thrall's or Pennybacker's history of Texas for the first time is lost in wonder and admiration of the daring deeds and almost superhuman accomplishments of its brave patriots in their struggles for freedom.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301109">How many Texans have stood within the portal of the Alamo Mission in San Antonio and felt a glow of pride, not unmixed with sorrow, as the scene of cruel massacre of that little band, composed of 172 courageous men, by the savage Mexicans under their cruel leader, Santa Anna, rises before them.  How one's heart burns with indignation when he remembers that these martyrs were not even given a Christian burial, but were piled in a huge heap and burned!  Every one of that noble band killed and burned!  Every scene rises vividly before our eyes as we gaze upon the beautiful Alamo monument erected within the precincts of our capitol grounds in Austin.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301110">The State Teachers' Association, which convened at Austin, June 11 to June 14, was one of the most successful in its history.  The attendance was larger than that at Galveston last year, and the papers read showed careful preparation and were both instructive and helpful.  It is to be regretted that more of the young teachers do not take an interest in this association.  These inexperienced workers are just those who need the aid of such instruction, and yet they are slow in taking the advantage of the opportunity of meeting and comparing notes with our leading educators of the state.  We, as a race, labor under most adverse circumstances, and there are things which the young teacher, who is to succeed, must know. These cannot be found in text-books; they can only be imparted by those experienced educators who have worked in this particular field; they, only, can aid and strengthen these young birds which are, for the first time, about to essay their tiny wings and soar away. Too soon they will discover that they are not teaching the model boy or girl spoken of in the different educational journals, who always gives the expected answers. On the contrary, their boys and girls seldom or never give the correct answer, and they so discourage the young teacher that he often silently vows to let their morals, at least, severely alone. Theory is one thing, but practice is quite another. Let us urge our young educators to meet with us, join us, visit us, and learn how we have groped in the dark and reached--not perfection, but a plan for better and more effective labor.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301111">Teachers from all over the state were in attendance. All of the great schools were well represented. Dr. I.B. Scott, of Wiley University, at Marshall; Prof. H.T. Kealing of Paul Quinn College at Waco; Prof. L.C. Anderson of Prairie View State Normal School at Prairie View; Prof. M.H. Broyles of Hearne Academy at Hearne; and Prof. D. Abner, Jr., of Sequin College at Sequin. Beside these, all of the large cities were represented by the principals and assitants of the different schools, as well as the army of teachers from the rural districts.  What an array of intelligence and culture!  Nothing but a great good can come from such a gathering.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301112">The day sessions were held in the chapel of Tillotson College, and the night sessions at the Third Baptist Church, Wesley Chapel and the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church. It all ended in a blaze of elegance and beauty at Turner Hall, where the citizens had prepared a most sumptuous banquet, which was partaken of with much enjoyment, while the orchestra discoursed sweet strains of music.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301113">Just a word to my friends. You see that Texas has joined this grand array of states, and she has come to stay. We wish to make the Texas department one of which all Texans may be proud.  This can only be done with your assistance.  Do not wait until your school re-opens to give us your subscription, but subscribe at once, so that you may not miss anything.  The paper is such as to need no encomiums; one needs but to see it to like it, and only to read it in order to praise it. I ask you to give me your aid by passing the paper on to some friend.  Texas must not be behind the other states. I rely upon you to assist me in making it second to none.

Among the graduates were included Miss Genevieve Lee from the Newton High School, Miss Gertrude Peake from the Boston High, and Miss Mary Lewis from the Everett school.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301117">Out at Harvard Mr. W.H.

Mr. Trotter an especially large company of buds and belles and matrons.  Of course, "it goes without saying," although said many dozens of times, that everything was "perfectly lovely."  The day was perfect, the girls radiant in their fresh and appropriate costumes, and "the spread" most satisfactory.  Conspicuous among the girls present were Misses Maud Trotter, Cromwell, Marsh, Glover, Grant, Lillian Lewis, Cartwright, Scotron and Bessie Mitchell.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301119">The closing of the schools brings home our college girls as well as our teachers.

Miss Howard is well remembered here as a girl of especial vivacity, intelligence, and attractiveness.  She marries the Rev. John W. Johnson of Virginia, and will make her home in Richmond.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301122">Rev. A.C.  Garner, of Paris, Texas, and Mrs. H.E.

The list of subscribers is still expanding.  I can but express my heartfelt gratitude to those who have shown and are still showing by every means in their power the interest they take in the uplifting of the womanhood of the race by their labors on behalf of the WOMAN'S ERA and "The Work of the Afro-American Woman."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301127">One of the most gratifying facts in my experience of this work is the deep interest taken in these publications by the men of the race.  Many of the progressive professional men of Philadelphia, such as Drs. Jackson and Cox, dentists, Dr. George R. Hylton and Dr. N. F. Mossell have secured copies of these works for use in the waiting rooms at their offices.  Other gentlemen have subscribed for these works as birthday, graduation and wedding gifts, and also assisted in the sale at many points.  These facts prove conclusively that if a just cause be properly presented, the men of the race will show themselves loyal to the work in hand.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301128">A dear unknown white friend in the south sends me a letter stating the fact of her having come in possession of the last three copies of the ERA containing the Open Court.  She is engaged in work among the colored people.  She desires to present and has already presented me with pamphlets of Bible readings.  For all this I appreciate the dear lady, but her letter continues and I cannot forbear giving the readers of the ERA an extract from the closing pages:</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301129" n="16 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1301130"><gap agent="unknown"/>own race in love for us, for I don't think many of us have thought of formulating a very decided wish to meet with many brethren and sisters of color in heaven.  </p><p xml:id="era2_1301131"> editor meets in the course of years with many proofs of kindness, but this assurance that our people, as represented by the various departments of the ERA, are not looked upon as heathen, surpasses all others thus far received.  </p><p xml:id="era2_1301132">all means let us continue this work of convincing our white friends of our merits.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_04.19" type="Review"><head rend="center">LITERATURE DEPARTMENT.</head><docAuthor>Medora W.

The introduction is by Julia Ward Howe, and it contains many full page portraits.  The general subjects embraced are: Women in the Home, Women in Professions, Business and Trade, Women in Literature, Women in Art and Music, Women in Education and Science, Women in Philanthropy, Women in Church Work, Missions and Charities.  It contains many interesting anecdotes and personal sketches as well as brilliant articles from the pens of Mrs. U.S. Grant, Jessie Benton Fremont, Mrs. Frank Leslie, Jane G. Austin, Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher, Mary A. Livermore and many others.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301134">Someone who knows whereof he speaks, says, in regard to the countless number of books being published at present, "The quality of the paper is so poor that at the beginning of the twenty-first century, not one of them will be in existence." Mr. Swan, the Massachusetts Commissioner of Public Records, after a thorough investigation of the subject concludes that there is as good, if not better, paper made today than ever before, as well as poorer, but that neither good paper nor good ink can be had at bargain counter prices. It has been suggeted that public libraries be supplied with books of superior material that can be warranted to outlast those now in general use.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301135">Bret Harte is said to be about to publish a fairly long story, but whether is is a romance of California or London is not known.  What a pity he did not save his very euphonious title, "The Bell Ringer of Angels," for a long story instead of applying it to such a short one. This story, "The Bell Ringer of Angels," contains a deep romance in spite of its brevity.

Carmand</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_1301365">Feeling the need of our women coming in closer contact with one another to discuss matters of vital interest to the race we represent, and which can only be done by organization, the Women's Loyal Union was formed December 5, 1892, with Mrs. Victoria Matthews as president, which office she now holds, and to whom much of the success of the Union is due.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301366">We have for our watchwords, "Vigilant, Patriotic, and Steadfast."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301367">Our object is the diffusion of accurate and extensive information relative to the civil and social status of the colored American citizen, that they may be directed to an intelligent assertion of their rights, and unite in the employment of all lawful means to secure and retain the undisputed exercise of them.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301368">The methods of the Union are, First, full and free discussion of existing evils, moral, physical, and political. Second, the circulation of printed matter relating to the colored American, whether written by them or not.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301369">We have a membership of over seventy women, pledged as willing workers. Many have proven themselves, zealous, earnest, and always ready when called upon to contribute not only their time, but their means. Among, our members we claim professional women, doctors, school-teachers, literary women, writers of poetry and prose, trades women, artists, home-makers and housekeepers.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301370">We have formed chapters, or branches, in Charleston, S. C., Memphis, Tenn., Philadelphia, Penn., and Brooklyn, N. Y. Since our organization, we have called public meetings in our churches to discuss topics affecting the interests of the race in the Southland and in our own section, with beneficial results. At one of our meetings we had the honor of having present as our guest, the President of your club, Mrs. Josephine Ruffin, who read a very interesting paper. We have contributed clothing and money to the Sea Island sufferers; presented a very fine Mason and Hamlin organ to the Colored Hospital and Home of this city. To stimulate race pride, we held in the parlors of a private residence an exhibition of art, work done by colored men and women, with marked results; so much so that an organization now holds an art exhibit every year.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301371">Sent petitions on the Blair Resolution to Congress, signed by over ten thousand men and women. Through the untiring energy of our President, distributed hundreds of circular letters through the South and West, asking for information concerning the moral, intellectual, physical, and home life, generally, of families. Assisted various causes by giving entertainments.  Presented Miss Hallie Q. Brown with a purse of money toward her mission in England, to solicit funds to establish a library at Wilberforce College, to be called Frederick Douglass Library.

In this way we hope to reach the masses, and do more effectual good than spoken words to the few.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301375">We have not always had the helping hand extended to us that an organization and such an object calls for and demands, but by persistent effort in the future, as in the past, we hope to merit the good will and ready assistance of all good women throughout the land.</p><byline>KATIE V.

Capelton</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_1301377">Under the name of the Harper W.C.T.U. a few of our women have been organized and work along reformatory lines for the past five years, the object being to better the condition of the colored people of the community by a gradual training of the mind to higher aims and purposes of life.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301378">Realizing the value of the words of Solomon, "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it," we early opened a training school, and each Saturday afternoon gathered the children and gave them about an hour's instruction in plain sewing, after which short talks on temperance, truthfulness, honesty, etc., were given by some of the women of the Union.  Pretty songs were also taught which the children delighted in.  At length a fair was held, and each article made by the children, together with fancy articles made by members and friends were placed on exhibition with the maker's name attached.  Each child delighted to point out to parent or friend any article she had made, and a parent delighted to buy because her child had made it.  This training school proved very helpful to the children.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301379">The Union also held mothers' meetings, and special talks were given on "Child Culture," "Social Purity," "Value of Example," etc.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301380">Our much beloved and esteemed F.E.W. Harper was brought to Jefferson City to lecture, and the great zeal and inspiration of this race-loving woman is still bearing fruit, from seed sown when she was with us years ago.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301381">In fact, any zeal that I, or most of the other colored women of Missouri have today for the uplifting of humanity, we owe to Mrs. Harper, who came to us and turned our thought to the great need of earnest effort by our women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301382">At Jefferson City, Mo., there was a number of women who, for various reasons, we could not enlist in our W. C. T. U. work, so in a meeting of the Union we decided to extend our borders, and admit women who were not specially pledged to temperance work.  Therefore, the Woman's Club was formed, the special object of which is to work more earnestly for the purity of our homes and the general advancement of colored women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301383">The first week as a club was to bring Miss Ida B. Wells Barnett to Jefferson City to lecture, June 18. By her graphic descriptions of the wrongs upon our race, she won the applause of all who heard her.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301384">The ERA and other colored  papers are read and discussed at our meetings.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301385">When the call for this Conference was made through the ERA, to refute the charge of immorality by one J. W. Jacks of Missouri, on hearing his slanderous letter our women became aroused as never before.  Committees were appointed to confer with ministers; as  a result, three large public meetings were held and strong resolutions adopted and sent to Montgomery City, Mo., his home, to England, and the press.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301386">Nothing has ever called forth such just indignation from the citizens of Jefferson as did this base letter, coming as it did from our own state. When this call for a Conference was read, they decided to send a delegate, at any cost, to utter their project.  And never did women work more earnestly than did these slandered women to raise the money which makes it possible for me to be with you today.  Their prayer is that we may yet bring good out of this great evil done us, by resolving here to so unite ourselves and concentrate our forces that we may be able to show to the world that we, as colored women, are struggling for a higher, nobler, and purer life.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301387">The following resolutions were adopted and sent to this Conference:--</p><p xml:id="era2_1301388">JEFFERSON CITY, Mo., July 23, 1895.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301389">National Convention of the Women's Club, Boston, Massachusetts:</p><p xml:id="era2_1301390">At a recent meeting of the Woman's Club, located at Jefferson City, Missouri, in Cole County, a committee was appointed to draw up resolutions denouncing certain slanderous statements which were written in a letter to Miss Florence Balgarnie, London, England, dated March 6, 1895, by one J. W. Jacks, president of the Missouri Press Association.  Whereas he says, first, that the Negroes of this country are wholly devoid of morality; second, that the women are prostitutes and all are natural liars and thieves.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301391">THEREFORE be it resolved, That we denounce him publicly to the entire country as a falsifier, and his statement as wholly devoid of truth.</p><byline>M.

Craig, eighteen women assembled in Omaha, Feb. 14, '95, to discuss plans for organizing the progressive women of the city into one united body, whose aims and purposes might be the education of the heart, hand and mind of the individual members and the promotion and advancement of all race measures. Realizing the fact that the best success results from concerted action, and that not individual effort, nor the efforts of the few, but rather the united efforts of the masses must win the desired end, the women unanimously agreed to organize themselves into a body that should be liberal in its principles, broad, charitable and far reaching.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301394">The result was an association called "The Woman's Club of Omaha," which aims to serve a three-fold purpose.  First, to stimulate intellectual development; second, to promote unity and good fellowship amongst its members, and thirdly, to strengthen by organization, individual, philanthropic and reformatory effort.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301395">The club is strictly nonsectarian in its principles and offers its advantages to any respectable woman who is in sympathy with the work and may present herself for membership.  Already the number has increased from 18 to 15 active workers, and the club enjoys the happy distinction of possessing the approbation and endorsement of nearly every broad-minded, race-loving, progressive citizen of Nebraska.  As a further mark of recognition, the club has received greetings from the Omaha's Woman's Club, an organization composed of 600 white women; resolutions of endorsement from the Afro-American League of Nebraska, an institution operated by the negro talent of the state, and numerous  letters of approval from the clergy, literary societies and private citizens.  It is the hope of the women to soon establish themselves in permanent club rooms where they may hold their regular meetings, lectures, etc., and conduct a library and reading room for club members and any other women who may desire to take advantage.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301396">A committee is now negotiating for such rooms and until the plans are completed the club will continue to hold bi-weekly meetings at the homes of the members.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301397">For intellectual development the club work is divided into three departments, viz., Political Economy and Civil Government, Current Topics and English Literature and History.  Every member of the club must register in some one of these departments, all of which, under competent leaders, are doing excellent work.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301398">In all reformatory efforts affecting mankind generally and women particularly the club enters enthusiastically.  At the last general assembly of the state of Nebraska it was engaged earnestly in the effort to stop the manufacture and sale of cigarettes in the state, and joined heart and soul in the social purity question, sending down to the legislature a petition, bearing the names of 150 colored women, praying that the body to raise the "age of consent" from 15 to 18 years.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301399">In many ways the association has helped individual advancement, and much credit attaches to it for its unceasing and untiring efforts in securing the appointment of a negro teacher in the public schools of Omaha.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301400">While the club was organized primarily for intellectual improvement, social affairs are not entirely neglected, and its members strive to create and foster a spirit of kindliness and sociability amongst women generally by bringing them in friendly touch with one another, but the lighter amusements of life are discouraged in that the club as a club does not engage in them.  To supply the diversion necessary to healthy social life, a series of lectures, followed by an hour's social intercourse, has been inaugurated and is yielding excellent results.  The annual lecture course consists of eight numbers, the most of which are to be gratuitously furnished by local talent, in which Omaha happily abounds, and as the club can arrange to do so the remaining numbers will be filled by the best imported talent the race affords.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301401">Together with the prescribed club studies and readings and the lecture course the Woman's Club of Omaha is thoroughly enjoying its initial year.  Perfect harmony and good will prevail amongst the members, and the women seeking to "touch life with upward impulse" are quietly executing their desires to make our girls better women, our women better wives, our wives better mothers.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301402">The western delegates were typical western women, bright and alert, and thoroughly at home on the floor.  Unfortunately their stay was so limited, and the sessions of this congress so prolonged and fatiguing that Boston saw little of them socially.  All of the westerners, Mrs. Pitts, Miss Anthony, and Mrs. Mahammit were at Mrs. Ransom's.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301403" n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/></div><div xml:id="era2_05.07" type="Letter"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">LETTER OF ONE THOUSAND WOMEN</seg> OF BETHEL CHURCH, NEW YORK.</head><docAuthor>The Women of Bethel Church, New York City.</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_1301404">To the Women's Convention, Boston, Mass.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301405">The call sent out by the Era Club proposing a gathering of Afro-American women in deliberative convention simply put in words what has long been the wish of thousands.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301406">We are sorry, that the "Jack's letter" should seem to be the prick which stung to activity. We would not have it to appear that we are aroused to action only by the irritation of external circumstances, but would be glad for the world to know that, in reality, our women are taking intelligent cognizance of the inner life of the race, and that the desire to be actually noble is more potent than the impulse to resent insult and seek vindication. What we think of ourselves is always more important than what others think of us, that is to say, self-respect based upon truth is the foundation we seek to lay.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301407">We would desire the world to know that long before the base slanders, born in the vile mind of a common Missouri white man, were uttered, our women were actively at work among the masses of our people, seeking to ground them in the fundamental principles of true progress. The existence of such a sheet as THE WOMAN'S ERA, the existence of such organizations as the Women's Loyal Union, the Women's Afro-American League, the Women's Meeting of Bethel Church, the work which these various enterprises have laid out and the earnestness with which it has been pursued, are in themselves a complete vindication against all slander. We trust that the vile "Jack's letter" will not give color to your deliberations nor in any sense become the spur under which you lay out the work of the future. We would have the world to see that there is a large element of our women who, in convention assembled, can show complete freedom from the imaginative and mercurial disposition which has been the fatal defect in so many conventions of our men.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301408">We believe that it would be unwise to permit this convention to be the sounding board of mere "agitators."  We recognize in the "Jack's letter" and other such slanders the natural results of the resentment provoked by the fierce denunciations of "southern white women" that have been injudiciously indulged in by some of the "mercurial persons" of the race.  We look with more hope to the conservative workers who seek to lay true foundations and who employ such means as the well-edited WOMAN'S ERA and the well-conducted organizations referred to above. The truly representative women of the race can never be enlisted in any movement that is lead by the ignorant enthusiasts or the fiery agitators, whose incentive to action is the intoxication of excited sensibilities, full of the chimeras of distempered fancy.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301409">We know the character of those under whom this convention is called, and we have faith in the calm sobriety which has always characterized their endeavors. We send to you Mrs. Hannah Jones, who will represent the one thousand Afro-American women of Bethel congregation. Our work is among the masses and our motto is "true progress."  We can and will lend powerful support to such enterprises as promise true good to the race.</p><salute>May God prosper your great undertaking.</salute><signed><name>THE WOMEN OF BETHEL CHURCH.</name><address><addrLine>New York City.</addrLine></address></signed></div><div xml:id="era2_05.08" type="Letter"><docAuthor>Miss Josie B.

The Home is unendowed, our means support being by donation, subscription, and entertainment.  Our current expenses are from $100.00 to $115.00 per month. We keep regularly employed a matron, nurse, and cook. While non-sectarian, it is emphatically a religious institution.

P RUFFIN</seg>, PRESIDENT OF CONFERENCE.</head><p xml:id="era2_1301542">It is with especial joy and pride that I welcome you all to this, our first conference. It is only recently that women have waked up to the importance of meeting in council, and great as has been the advantage of women <hi rend="italic">generally</hi>, and important as it is and has been that they should confer, the necessity has not been nearly so great, matters at stake not nearly so vital, as that <hi rend="italic">we</hi>, bearing peculiar blunders, suffering under especial hardships, enduring peculiar privations, should meet for a "good talk" among ourselves.  Although rather hastily called, you as well as I can testify how long and how earnestly a conference has been though of and hoped for and even prepared for.  These women's clubs, which have sprung up all over the country, built and run upon broad, strong lines, have all been a preparation, small conferences in themselves, and their spontaneous birth and enthusiastic support have been little less than inspirational on the part of our women and a general preparation for a large union such as it is hopes this conference will lead to.  Five years ago we had no colored women's clubs outside of those formed for special work; to-day, with little over a month's notice, we are able to call representatives from more than twenty clubs.  It is a good showing, it stands for much, it shows that we are truly American women, with all the adaptability, readiness to seize and possess our opportunities, willingness to do our part for good as other American women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301544">The reasons why we should confer are so appar-
<pb xml:id="era2_1301543" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
ent that it would seem hardly necessary to enumerate them, and yet there is none of them but demand our serious consideration. In the first place we need to feel the cheer and inspiration of meeting each other, we need to gain the courage and fresh life that comes from the mingling of congenial souls, of those working for the same ends. Next, we need to talk over not only those things which are of vital importance to us as women, but also the things that are of especial interest to us as <hi rend="italic">colored </hi> women, the training of our children, openings for our boys and girls, how they can be prepared for occupations and occupations may be found or opened for them, what we especially can do in the moral education of the race with which we are identified, our mental elevation and physical development, the home training it is necessary to give our children in order to prepare them to meet the peculiar conditions in which they shall find themselves, how to make the most of our own, to some extent, limited opportunities, these are  some of our own peculiar questions to be discussed. Besides these are the general questions of the day, which we cannot afford to be indifferent to: temperance, morality, the higher education, hygienic and domestic questions. If these things need the serious consideration of women more advantageously placed by reason of all the aid to right thinking and living with which they are surrounded, surely we, with everything to pulls us back, to hinder us in developing, , need to take every opportunity and means for the thoughtful consideration which shall lead to wise action.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301545">I have left the strongest reasons for our conferring together until the last. All over America there is to be found a large and growing class of earnest, intelligent, progressive colored women, women who, if not leading full useful lives, are only waiting for the opportunity to do so, many of them warped and cramped for lack of opportunity, not only to do more but <hi rend="italic">be</hi> more; and yet, if an estimate of the colored women of America is called for, the inevitable reply, glibly given, is, "For the most part ignorant and immoral, some exceptions, of course, but these don't count."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301546">Now, for the sake of the thousands of self-sacrificing young women teaching and preaching in lonely southern backwoods for the noble army of mothers who have given birth to these girls, mothers whose intelligence is only limited by their opportunity to get at books, for the sake of the fine cultured women who have carried off the honors in school here and often abroad, for the sake of our own dignity, the dignity of our race, and the future good name of our children, it is "mete, right and our bounden duty " to stand forth and declare ourselves and principles, to teach an ignorant and suspicious world that our aims and interests are identical with those of all good aspiring women. Too long have we been silent under unjust and unholy charges; we cannot expect to have them removed until we disprove them through ourselves. It is not enough to try to disprove unjust charges through individual effort, that never goes any further. Year after year southern women have protested against the admission of colored women into any national organization on the ground of the immorality of these women, and because all refutation has only been tried by individual work the charge has never been crushed, as it could and should have been at the first.  Now with an army of organized women standing for purity and mental worth, we in ourselves deny the charge and open the eyes of the world to a state of affairs to which they have been blind, often willfully so, and the very fact that the charges, audaciously and flippantly made, as they often are, are of so humiliating and delicate a nature, serves to protect the accuser by driving the helpless accused into mortified silence. It is to break this silence, not by noisy protestations of what we are not, but by a dignified showing of what we are and hope to become that we are impelled to take this step, to make of this gathering all object lesson to the world. For many and apparent reasons, it is especially fitting that the <hi rend="italic">women </hi>of the race take the lead in this movement, but for all this we recognize the necessity of the sympathy of our  husbands, brothers and fathers.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301547">Our woman's movement is woman's movement in that it is led and directed by women for the good of women and men, for the benefit of <hi rend="italic">all</hi> humanity, which is more than any one branch or section of it.  We want, we ask the active interest of our men, and, too, we are not drawing the color line; we are women, American women, as intensely interested in all that pertains to us as such as all other American women; we are not aleniating or withdrawing, we are only coming to the front, willing to join any others in the same work and cordially inviting and welcoming any others to join us.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301549">If there is any one thing I would especially
<pb xml:id="era2_1301548" n="15 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
enjoin upon this conference it is union and earnestness. The questions that are to come before us are of too much import to be weakened by my trivialities or personalities. If any differences arise let them be quickly settled, with the feeling that we are all workers to the same end, to elevate and dignify colored American womanhood. This conference will not be what I expect if it does not show the wisdom, indeed the absolute necessity of a national organization of our women. Every year new questions coming up will prove it to us. This hurried, almost informal convention does not begin to meet our needs, it is only a beginning, made here in dear old Boston, where the scales of justice and generosity hang evenly balanced, and where the people "dare be true" to their best instincts and stand ready to lend aid and sympathy to worthy strugglers.  It is hoped and believed that from this will spring an organization that will in truth bring in a new era to the colored women of America.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_05.25" type="Poem"><head rend="center">GREETING TO THE CONVENTION.</head><docAuthor>Alice T.

It is an earnest of the single-mindedness of our women and a good omen of the future efficiency and prosperity of our organization. Under the leadership of Mrs. Washington, who has devotion, energy, intelligence, and a large charity, no colored woman who has the interest of her race at heart can find excuse not to enlist.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_05.28.2" type="Editorial"><p xml:id="era2_1301575">The WOMAN'S ERA desires that its position in regard to the W.C.T.U. should be clearly defined. At the conference lately held in Boston a resolution endorsing the work and methods of the W.C.T.U. was introduced by Mrs. Anthony of Missouri, and an effort made to "rush" it through the convention. Mrs. Ridley, realizing that the majority of women present were unacquainted with the facts in the case, made an explanation, and in order that time might be gained to lay the matter squarely before the women, supported the president in her voting of the resolution as out of order. However, the Washington delegation pushed the matter, the resolution was presented and carried with half the women not voting and our dissenting voices.

Are these crimes growing in England? And if so, as it seems to us they are, where are we to look for the reason? Is it not in the failure to mete out justice to such offences? Look up the records and see how often capture of the offenders has utterly failed, and how often sentence has been commuted to inadequate punishment. <hi rend="italic">It is such crimes and such travesties of justice that have made lynching possible in the United States.</hi> There is little likelihood that England will relapse into barbarism; but how should we like to hear of societies in America formed to secure Safety Of Person to English Female Children?"</p><p xml:id="era2_1301585">We feel much satisfaction in being able to publish this; it settles the disputed question as to the position of these ladies of the W.C.T.U. on lynch law.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301586">The argument set forth in this republished note has been made so many times that it hardly calls for an answer now.

Mr. Conway, who is a native Virginian, says that his visit greatly strengthened his conviction of  the value and importance of the English Committee.  There is a combination of forces in America tending to induce torpor with regard to the lynchings in the South.  He has not seen in any daily paper of New York for several years a single editorial protest, of any earnestness, against these atrocities. In Boston, the Boston <hi rend="italic">Transcript</hi>, an influential evening paper, has, however, written powerfully on the subject, and in Chicago, the residence of Miss Wells, now Mrs. Barnett, the services of the Chicago <hi rend="italic">Inter-Ocean</hi> have been very great. But the American conscience has not been fully aroused. At the late meeting in London of the British Women's Temperance Association an American speaker, Mrs. Rounds, said, 'If we in America could only feel that when a criminal has been brought to trial and condemned, his sentence would be carried out, we should feel very different on this question of lynching. 'This,' says Mr. Conway, 'was a were imposition on the English women.  <hi rend="italic">Where are the instances of pardons contrary to public feeling?  In all American history there has never been an instance of pardon for a Negro violator of a white women or child.</hi>  That anyone making such a misleading statement in the presence of leading American women should not have been checked, illustrates what I have said, that my countrywomen are not yet awakened to this frightful wrong.'"</p><p xml:id="era2_1301590">Our August number has been delayed in order to give our readers the news from the conference.

Benjamin's device known as the 'Gong Signal Chair.' This young lady inventor is at present a medical student in one of the colleges of the District of Columbia. She was born in South Carolina, and educated in Massachusetts. In 1888 the patent was issued to her, and soon after an improvement was added in order to cheapen as well as to add to the utility of the appliance.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301599">"The invention is one of those useful novelties suitable for chairs in hotels and restaurants, on steamboats or railroad trains. It can also be used in theatres or legislative halls, and for invalids' chairs in the hospitals.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301600">"The object of the invention is to mainly reduce the expenses by decreasing the number of attendants usually required for the convenience of guests; also to obviate the necessity of hand-clapping and loud calling, where the service of a page or waiter is needed. The present system now in vogue is to have one attendant for about every three or four guests. By the use of this invention, it is claimed, one waiter will be enabled to attend to the wants of from twelve to fifteen guests."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301601">The young and flourishing Newbury Association of Boston held a delightful dinner and smoke talk at the suburban residence of Mr. J. B. Tatum, West Medford, early last mouth. A score or more of the members were present, and shared Mr. Tatum's hospitality in the way of a bountiful course dinner. Covers were laid for sixteen. Among the guests were Lawyer Clifford Plummer and Mr. Samuel Hodges, both of whom made encouraging and instructive addresses. Mr. Shirley Liggins, toastmaster, introduced the members in a particularly witty vein, and hearty responses were made to the toasts.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301602">The young men composing the Association are for the most part so progressive as to be already well known in connection with successful business enterprises, Mr. J.B. Tatum being manager of the well-known catering establishment of J.R. Young, Mr. Clarence Robinson, associated with his father in the express business, and Mr. W.H. Scott occupying a trustworthy position with the Washington Street Stationer, M.R. Warren. Besides these gentlemen the Association includes Mr. W.H. Wilson, president, Messrs.

Hodges.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301603">Miss Emma Wariner will remain away from Boston during the summer months.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301604">Boston has been a veritable Mecca in this, the summer of '95. The C.E. brought a small army of visitors, and later the Conference swelled the number.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301605">During the early part of July, Misses Miranda Vennig. and Carrie Compton of Philadelphia were in the city, the former the guest of Mrs. Lewis Terry; Misses Cora and Gertrude Smith of Washington the guests of the Misses Smith of Jamaica Plain; Miss Julia Wormley of Washington, who visited Mrs. B. R. Wilson; Mrs. Ellen Cruns and Miss Ingalls of Charleston; the Misses Williams of Washington; Mrs. Clough of Worcester, Miss Murphy, Miss McCloud, and Miss Param of St. Louis. So many of the young and shining lights necessarily called forth something in the way of social festivities. Among the occasions was a reception by Mrs. Terry and the Misses Smith; a musicale by Miss Glover; a large harbor party managed by Mrs. J. H. Lewis, an "At Home" by Miss Grant, and a supper by Miss Lillian Lewis; besides these were numerous smaller teas, luncheons, theatre parties, and excursions.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301606">Miss Marion Shadd is spending the entire summer with Mrs. B.R. Wilson. Miss Shadd is studying geology at Harvard and most of her recreation is in this manner as excursions taken by the class in the study of rocks, etc. Mrs. Wilson has also entertained her brother, Mr. Bruce Evans, and Mrs. J.F. Cook and Miss Cook of Washington. Mrs. Cook was a delegate to the Conference, and both she and her daughter have been the recipients of much attention.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301607">Mrs. G.F. Grant entertained Miss Smith and Miss Hunter during the Conference week.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301608">Mrs. R. Jerome Jeffrey of Rochester, formerly of Boston has surprised and pleased her old friends by a visit to Boston, where she has taken up things just where she left; not only has she been prominent socially, but was also one of the active workers in the Conference.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301609">The Misses. Baldwin have been entertaining Mrs. Cooper and Miss Barier of Washington and Miss Florence Lewis of Philadelphia. It would  be hard to get together a group of brighter women than these, and it goes without saying that the group of pleasure trips planned by the Misses Baldwin for their guests which included pilgrimages to Concord and to Plymouth, and trips down the harbor and drives through the country were in every respect delightful.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301610">Miss Edwina Kruse of Washington is also in Boston; Miss Kruse is one of those general favorites who is welcomed wherever she goes.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301611">Miss Marie L. Burgess has only just left the work she is so devoted to in the hospital at Hampton Institute, and come on to Boston to enjoy the few remaining weeks of her vacation.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301612" n="19 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1301613">Among the best known and most conspicuous women of the convention were Mrs. Cook, Mrs. Matthews, and Mrs. Cooper; all of these are women of unusual ability, and yet each is essentially different from the other. Mrs. Cook, intelligent and practical, and although versed in parliamentary tactics --always a cultured lady; Mrs. Matthews, full of fire and intensity, with natural gifts as a speaker and writer; Mrs. Cooper calm, thoughtful, and analytical,--a woman to mould opinion, rather than a leader of men. Mrs. Cooper, the student; Mrs. Matthews, a born leader; Mrs. Cook, the trained leader.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301614">Another conspicuous figure was that of Mrs. B.T. Washington. Mrs. Washington wins love; she is warmhearted and largehearted, practical and earnest.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301615">Miss Hunter and Miss Smith were among the younger members of the council, and were conspicuous for their culture and intelligence.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301616">Mrs. Williams of New York was also a notable figure. Mrs. Williams was ready in debate, and in her paper on the race work was one of those who "caught" the conference.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301617">The alacrity with which our gentlemen friends responded to an invitation to address the conference one evening, on "political economy" proves what we have always asserted, that intelligent people who are earnestly and honestly seeking to advance the humanities, are not divided by either race or sex or section. T. Thomas Fortune, whose position as chief editor of the New York <hi rend="italic">Age</hi>, special writer on the New York <hi rend="italic">Sun</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Age-Herald</hi>, makes him easily the foremost among colored journalists, ran over from New York to show his interest in the woman movement, and immediately ran off again to his work, thus depriving the ladies of the W.E.C. of the chance to show him some of the attention they thought he deserved and they had planned to give him. Henry B. Blackwell hastened back to Boston from a Chautauquan engagement in New Hampshire to tell the ladies, as no other could, their duty and opportunity in the coming crisis in the cause of woman suffrage.  His speech was thoroughly appreciated and made converts to the cause he always advocates, both among the men and women present. Wm. Lloyd Garrison promptly accepted the invitation, and as usual honored the gathering with an address as carefully prepared as would have been done for delivery before the U.S. Senate. To show the position of the "new" man on the subject of woman suffrage, Stanley Ruffin had been invited and was prepared to deliver an address. on that topic, but in the pressure for time home folk had to take a back seat.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301618">The <hi rend="italic">Courant</hi>'s excellent report of the convention deserves especial notice.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_05.31" type="Editorial"><p xml:id="era2_1301619">The WOMAN'S ERA is not satisfied with Miss Willard's rather mild treatment of the lynching outrages at the South, while it recognizes the fact that "Miss Willard is at the head of a tremendous organization, and in that capacity and in order to keep everything and everybody harmonious, is obliged to be politic, and for the welfare of the W.C.T.U. not to antagonize any section of this country."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301620">No one yields to the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Voice</hi> in its admiration of Miss Willard, but a little more vim and fire in her utterances on this and kindred subjects would be refreshing.  The milk and water resolution passed at the London W.C.T.U. Convention that "We deplore the taking of life without trial," must strike our Southern brethren in much the same light that "Miss Feely's whips" did Topsy, as more amusing than painful. --<hi rend="italic">Woman's Voice</hi></p></div><pb xml:id="era2_1301621" n="20 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era2_05.32" type="Report"><head rend="center">TEXAS.</head><docAuthor>Cora L.

It is to be hoped that many of our young women will grasp this opportunity to make themselves proficient in this most useful occupation. I believe this is the only school in the state which makes a specialty of nursing. Why do not our other large schools attempt something in this line? It does not require the expenditure of any amount of money and is far more useful and practical than so much fancy work and drawing, for few, very few, ever become skillful in either of these arts.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301623">Since the meeting of the Teachers' Convention at Austin everything has settled down into a monotonous routine and the teachers are scattered to the four winds. Now is the hard part of the teacher's lot. The all-absorbing question is, "Shall I be successful in procuring a summer Normal certificate?" Those who are not spending these hot days in teaching in some Normal are studying for the examination, occupying every spare moment in trying to master all the technicalities of each subject. It is certainly hard that teachers have to be called up at the most inopportune moments for examinations. The time which should be given to light reading and pleasant recreations must be spent in the hottest weather in hard study. In no other profession is this the case. There is little time for reading, for the text book must be one's constant companion. Why cannot successful teachers, who have taught a certain number of years, be given permanent certificates? The last legislature repealed this act before it had been given a fair trial.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301624">The election of officers of the State Teachers' Association seems to have given entire satisfaction. There were few dissenting voices and little or no caucusing, which was somewhat unusual. The following officers were elected : Prof. M.H. Broyes, Pres.; F.W. Gross, W.M. Taylor, Miss Hattie E. Lee,  B.T. Wilson and Mrs. D. Abner, Jr., Vice-Pres. ; Miss Cora L. Smith, Sec., and Mr. W.R. Taylor, Asst. Sec., with Mr. E.L. Blackshear, Treas. The next meeting of the Association will be held at Corsicana.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301625">All of the large cities in most of the other states are having woman's clubs, whose objects are to elevate and better the condition of women both morally and intellectually. Why cannot we, in Texas, have a few clubs? Let the leading women of each city get together and organize and go to work for ourselves. We must be taught to be good mothers; must learn how to train up our sons and daughters, for the future of our race depends upon the rising generation. Much good is being accomplished all over the union by the women's clubs, and Texas must not be behind in the march of progress.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301626">The last of the summer Normals opened on the l6th of July and will close on the 16th of August.  It was a happy thought of Mr. Carlisle's to have two examinations, one in July and one in August. It gives teachers two chances to win certificates, which is certainly encouraging to those who fall by the way.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301627">We are all glad that our little friend, Mrs. Wright Cuney, is at last convalescing. She has been so ill as to cause grave fears of her recovery, but now there seems little doubt that she will soon be around among us again. Miss Maud is already looking much more cheerful, as is also Mr. Cuney and Lloyd.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301628">June weddings were numerous and aristocratic this year.  That of Dr. W.T. Green, of Bryan, to Miss Leonora Bowers, of Galveston, was one of the most pleasing affairs of the season. The bride was most charming and even more graceful than usual. The presents were most costly and numerous.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301629">Many fine papers prepared for the conference remained unread; we might have been in session a week and then not have exhausted ourselves. Mrs. Luellan Williams, who is known to our readers as an able writer, sent a paper; Miss Ella Spencer's interesting paper on Art remained unread, as also did Mrs. Felts on Social Purity, Mrs. Anthony's and Mrs. Pitts', both on Race Work, and Mrs. Ridley's on What We Need for a More Equable Development.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301630">The papers especially prepared for the conference would make a creditable book, and although it is only possible for the ERA to print them singly, or at most doubly, it is hoped that in some way or other, at some time or other, they may all be collected in one volume.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301631">The sessions of the conference were brightened and lightened by some excellent music. Among contributors were Mrs. A. C. Sparrow, Miss Fisher, the WOMAN'S ERA protege, Miss Goines, Mr. Moses Hodges and Mr. Geo. L. Ruffin.

The one thing to be especially noted is the fact that those great journals which were once so hostile or disrespectful in all their references to colored people are now eager and pronounced in their encouragement and splendid estimate of the present worth and possibilities of the Negro race. As to the rights and wrongs of colored people, there is no longer any distinction between Democratic and Republican journals in the North. In this respect we have made a decided gain in our struggles to cultivate and win a favorable public opinion.  This growing habit on the part of hitherto hostile and unfriendly papers of telling the truth about us will inevitably beget among their readers the practice of doing justly.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301634">The public is being gradually educated up to the feeling that the American Negro is a very interesting person in his self-emancipating efforts.  There is so much of pathos, of desperate triumphs and tragic disappointments in every achievement of the race that the onlooking world cannot fail to be moved with wholesome interest. This interest will certainly increase and deepen with each year of our advancement, and become more and more allied to the kindly forces which are subtly working out our destinies.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301635">Referring again to colored graduates from western institutions, especial mentions should be made of Mr. Charles Winter Wood who received a B. A. from Beloit College, Wisconsin.  This is a case where a college degree contains more meaning than can be expressed in its perfunctory Latin and official signatures of president and faculty.  When Charles Winter Wood was gathered from the street gammins of Chicago and sent to Beloit College some years ago, hope of his recovery from the blight of his associations seemed ridiculous.  When he left Beloit the other day, polished, fluent, full of honors, and with the unstinted acclaim of the gathered thousands about him, his degree seems trifling when compared to his achievements.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301636">To say that Mr. Wood's especial distinction is his histrionic powers, may seem to cheapen his worth, because false standards have given a wearying prominence to so many "barn-stormers"!  It is not too much to say that these so-called "dramatic readers" can sustain no sort of comparison to Charles Winter Wood.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301637">Eight years ago the present Mr. Wood was discovered as "Charley" by Judge Jarvis Blume of this city, a man of fine literary taste, and a man full of chivalric kindness of disposition.  At the time of discovery Mr. Wood as a hopeless and almost homeless little urchin, but could imitate Irving with a wonderful accuracy and appreciation.  Judge Blume immediately decided he had found a rough diamond.  He took the boy to his office and got him to recite from Shakespeare to a company of gentlemen.  Every one was astonished, and after that actors and literary men, notably the late Prof. David Swing, heard him in parlors and testified to his exceptional gifts.  Interest in his education became manifest and finally a Mr. Hanson, a wealthy gentleman of this city, gladly assumed all responsibility for his proper education and has kept him in the Wisconsin Institution for the past seven years.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301638">While in the college he won nearly all the prizes in the college oratorical contests.  In the Greek tragedy, "Oedipus Rex," performed by the students at Beloit and Chicago, Mr. Wood took the title role and scored an extraordinary triumph.  The dramatic critics in Milwaukee and Chicago papers pronounced his rendition "phenomenal."  In voice, facial aptitudes, grace of movement and dramatic feeling, Mr. Wood is surprisingly gifted.  It is not enough to say that he is not equalled in America by any of his race.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301639">In deference to the wishes of his generous benefactor, Mr. Wood has decided to take a theological course in Princeton.  To those who have seen and heard him there is an instant wish that he might be given the utmost opportunity to develop his dramatic gifts.  He is a gentleman of such splendid rectitude of character, so refined I taste and culture-bent, that nothing would be too high, to hope for him on the stage, were he but untrammeled by the tyranny of American prejudice.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301640" n="22 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1301641">We Chicago women feel more or less ashamed in not being represented in the Boston Conference. The coming together of our representative women for high purposes is important enough to make us feel deeply concerned in the outcome. The character of the women who have been able to respond to the call inspires the absent ones with confidence that the Conference will mean much to every cause of peculiar interest to colored women. With such women it is not too much to hope that the Conference will set in force influences that will reach in their helpfulness the farthest confines of colored women's needs.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301642">The Woman's Clubs throughout the country are furnishing our women with the right kind of training for organic work.

The occasion of this interest was the convention of the Woman's Mite Missionary Society of the Third Episcopal District.  Some of the most distinguished divines of the A. M. E. church, noted professors and many of the brightest women of the race were in the city:  114 delegates were present.  The secretary reported over $1,000 collected during the year by small contributions.  Reports from the various societies were most encouraging and marked great advancement in the work during the past year.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301647">At the first session welcome addresses were made by Rev. I.W. Ross, Mrs. Gracie P. Offer, Mrs. D.S. Bently, Rev. W.H. Brown. These were responded to by Rev. Ransom of Cleveland, Mrs. S.T. Mitchell of Wilberforce, Mrs. Rosa Johnson of Cleveland, Bishop Arnett, Dr. Derrick. A letter of welcome from Mayor McKenna was read. Most of the next three days was spent in hearing papers and discussing questions relative to the work of this society.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301648">That the association is far from partial in its missionary efforts needs no further proof than the importance paid the subjects, "Our West Indian," "Our Indian Mission," "Our Librarian Mission." Very able papers on these subjects were read by Miss Anderson, Mrs. Caliman, and Mrs. Hicks. "The Short Line to the Redemption of Africa" was treated in a very original way by Mrs. Ransom of Cleveland. She said the ladies are collecting money to bring native Africans to this country to be educated and return to teach their own people. She lived in joyful anticipation of the time when the colored women of Africa and the colored women of America would clasp hands at the foot of the cross.  A very beautiful talk, full of inspiration to the younger women, was that of Miss Lizzie Jackson of Wilberforce, who told of "Woman's Work in the Mission Field." Mrs. Draper and Mrs. Thurman were always entertaining and instructive in any discussion.  It was a rare treat and one fully appreciated to have at the same time and for three successive days our own Bishop Barnett, Dr. Derrick and President S.T. Mitchell of Wilberforce.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301649">One very noticeable feature of the convention and worthy of commendation was the harmonious spirit that prevailed throughout the meeting.  It was undoubtedly a gathering of Christian workers intent upon doing the bidding of the Master.  We are glad to have had such a gathering of intelligent, zealous, Christian women among us.  Their presence has been cheering and inspiring.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301650">The following are the officers for the ensuing year:  Pres., Mrs. Gracie P. Offer; Cor.

We have been busily engaged every day since the glorious Fourth.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301654">Our Woman's Mite Missionary Convention which met in Pittsburg, Pa., was well attended and grand success followed our meeting.  Surely this organization of women of the Third Episcopal District is doing a noble work for humanity.  We were highly honored with our own fearless Bishop Arnett and the indefatigable Dr. Derrick.  These two were our timely counselors when our own storehouse of knowledge failed to meet the demand.  After a very pleasant four day's session of reviewing the work of the past year and formulating plans for the future, we very reluctantly took leave of one another, feeling that the convention was a success from the opening song to the fond benediction.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301655">We had no more than reached home and become partially rested before we were ready to be off again to our S.S. Institute at Hamilton, Ohio. This institute is not composed of women alone, but to lookers on it would seem as though the women had the day there. Owing to the absence of our President, Rev. Priolean, the first vice, Miss Jessie Henderson, presided, and for the impartial way in which she ruled she was elected president for the ensuing year.  Miss Henderson is quite young, a graduate of the high school and normal of Springfield, Ohio, and a student of Wittenburg College of the same place.  She is a power for good among our people and as bold as a lion in upholding the right. On the second day of our institute it afforded us unbounded pleasure to welcome the fraternal delegate from the Southern Ohio Institute in the person of Miss Minnie Moore, who came bringing greetings from the sister institute.  After three days' successful labor the convention adjourned to the banquet room, where, beneath palms and among flowers and happy faces, we lingered until the approach of the "wee sma'" hours.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301656">Time is fleeting. The conference of noble women is now a thing of the past, and although it was not our good fortune to clasp the hand of those who dare stand up for our womanhood, when recording the names of all the rest may ours stand out in bold relief as that of Abon Ben Adhern.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_05.37" type="Review"><head rend="center">LITERATURE DEPARTMENT.</head><docAuthor>Medora W.

It is a story of the many lives, upon which the shadow of the crime has fallen, and though perhaps not quite as good as his three celebrated novels, "The Deemster," "The Bondman," and "The Manxman," is sufficiently good to make a name for its author had these never been written.  The hero, Ralph Ray, like all of Hall Caine's heroes is a fine, strong, self-sacrificing man, who is ready to surrender his happiness to another; and his heroine, after deciding which of the two brothers she loves, sets about delivering him from a fearful suspicion in which she finally succeeds.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301658">Says the "Twentieth Century":  "The cause of social reform in this country is immensely indebted to Howells.

Its deep romance and dramatic episodes together with its exquisite local descriptions make for its author, B. Schultze-Smidt, a high place in the ranks of the novelist.  It is the story of an artist who in his travels in the Alps, falls in with a couple over whom a cloud of mystery and trouble has fallen.  The wife is accused of having killed her child, which in reality died by accident, and she by her sweetness of disposition and patient endurance of false accusation awakens a more than passing interest

WILLIE LAYTON, EDITOR.</byline><p xml:id="era2_1301666">California is so far away, and from Boston seven day's mail, therefore news by mail, which has become stale in eastern circles, is fresh to us behind the Rockies. To here offer good wishes for the success of the convention would be out of date, for before this appears in print the convention will have adjourned and the life of its good work begun.  Jacks' letter here and probably elsewhere received as much consideration as the laudable call to convention--possibly that too was wisdom's way. Said one of our women: "No one better knows than Jacks that the assertions in his letter are false. I do not fear his power to proselyte to his letter wording, believers from those who have not 'grown up in the wild and woolly west,' as I do fear the intimidation of many who might become part and parcel of public sentiment, condemning the unjust treatment of the negroes of this country. Our own boasted locality has recently demonstrated the sort of intimidating influences on a small scale that I argue."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301667">"I neither agree nor fully comprehend your argument," interrupted our dear little enthusiast, tiptoeing to a covert height. "To a certain extent Jacks' letter <hi rend="italic">is</hi> true. A story that is partly true is harder to contradict than one wholly untrue. I think individual efforts to higher and better living, voiced here and there in a quiet way through the medium of the press, will more effectually overcome the belief in such charges than these short-lived excitements. Though the convention may do some good, it is a splendid opportunity."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301669">"Jacks' reflections are <hi rend="italic">no more true</hi> of us than of other races, not as much," continued the first speaker in our group, tenacious of her view of the situation, and as if interrupted.  "We are aware of what followed the lecture of Rev. O. Summers, first negro chaplain of the late Cal. Assembly, protesting against the one blot now on the statute books of our state, the law making unconstitutional mixed marriages. At the close of the lecture one of our influential white divines, stirred by honest conviction and approval for every effort to elevate the moral condition of our state, in bold and strong words condemned class legislation and evidenced his influence to assist in striking from the California code the word 'black' or 'negro and mulatto' as it actually reads. In a few days after, you remember, appeared in one of our dailies a letter from an M.D., not as vile in slander of our morals as Jacks', but every whit as deeply colored with contemptible prejudice, I may even say blasphemous, for he attempted to base his illogical logic on God's word.  The white divine knew then, I believe he feels yet, that he spoke truth, but the M.D.'s criticism was stinging and severe, he became personal; the white divine had to reply.  He did not retract entirely his former statements, neither did he sustain them--was intimidated.  Expediency in his situation

Do you sabe my argument now?"</p><p xml:id="era2_1301670">While we were for the second silently absorbed in thought, an old '49er looked over her specs and said:  "Girls, I dunno how that Jack's letter hez struck other places, but my 'pinion is, that letter should be follered by er few mo jess like it; it'll do good yit; bitter medicine is sometimes the best.

She pleads that he is not responsible for his acts, that she, the mother, is; that she was forced by cruel treatment from his father, before the son's birth, to steal from the father's pockets money for her actual sustenance. She writes:  "Thus I went through all the brain sensations of a daring burglar, even such as I am informed you have become. Shortly after that you were born, and I firmly believe you came into the world a thief, owing to that crime-like though necessary practice of mine."  Medical science asserts and has proven that mothers influence the character of their children before they are born, and such a plea, while new as an argument of defense, is worthy of serious consideration, especially to colored women in view of the fact of the serious charges made against us.  Sacred should be esteemed the privileges of motherhood and jealously guarded, that only the noblest and best influences be exercised in the formation of the child's character before its birth. As some one has said, "The successful reformation of a nation is begun before 'it is born.'</p><p xml:id="era2_1301672">The comments of the local press on the successful rendition of the sparkling operetta, "New Flower Queen," classes it so far above <hi rend="italic">ordinary</hi> social events, that our letter would be incomplete without its mention.

The first hour will be devoted to business, after which an informal reception will be held in honor of the visiting president of the W.L.U. of New York.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301756">What promises to be a most interesting occasion is the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the United Daughters of Zion, Thursday evening, November 7, at Zion Church, when there will be congratulatory speeches, music, a collation, and other festive features. A most felicitous time is expected. This beneficent organization, in its fifty years of vigorous existence, has been a prime factor in the prevention of suffering and pauperism among colored people, and as such should receive public recognition.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301757">The Mammy Pleasance, referred to by many of our exchanges, and our California correspondent, will be recognized by a few old Bostonians as the mother of Miss Emma Stewart, the adopted  daughter of  Mr. and Mrs. Peyton Stewart. Mr. Stewart had the distinction of starting and successfully carrying on the first gymnasium established in Boston, with the daughter as teacher of the small, select ladies' class. Miss Stewart was greatly admired for her fine personal appearance and sweetness of disposition. All of the old girls will recall the good times at the Boylston Gym over the old Boylston Market, and the departure of the Stewart family to join Mrs. Pleasance in California, where one after another they passed away, a grandson being now the only survivor and heir-at-law to the great wealth accumulated by Mrs. Pleasance.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301758">Miss Mabel Grant is organist at the newly organized Congregational Church, of which the Rev.

More activity is being displayed in improvements in that street of four short blocks than in any other of the same length in the city.

Our country stands today strong, mighty and powerful -- a verified solution of the "one in many." A casual glance at the history of the nations of the world proves the superior strength of those who are united in purpose over those who are eyeing each other with covert suspicion, delving and scheming for petty, selfish ends, and stirring up anarchy and that strife that "divides man from man and makes him unmerciful to his brother."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301766">As the  united mothers of ancient Sparta felt the necessity of resolute action in order to develop a vigorous constitution and make strong the emotional natures of their sons, so do our women of America need to feel the importance of a united fixity of purpose in reference to the affairs that relate to the development of the members of our sex; for with unity of purpose and resolute action, our women will receive an impetus that will urge them to a higher plane of mental, moral and physical life.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301767">Thirty years ago, over two millions of our women were set free from bondage of soul and body. With few exceptions, such as had been gained by instinct, spiritual instruction, or a kind owner, none bad been taught lessons that tended to improve womanhood or motherhood, and their condition was most miserable. Without homes, and with no deep realization of their deplorable condition, many drifted here and there, often filling by the wayside, too helpless amidst their environment to have a desire to lead purer, nobler lives.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301768">Not many years and the American Missionary Association and a host of noble workers began to open the doors of their schools to these people. They were stunned and bewildered by the reaction of their freedom from slavery, but the hearts of these former slave mothers began to quicken with the hope of securing the advantages of an education for their children.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301769">With those born upon a more favored soil, many of these daughters stand today eager to lend a voice and a helping hand that will gain a reaction from the insidious influences of years of helpless bondage to the tempter, years in the thraldom of indifference, and years in the depths of some teachings that give its discount to lost virtue, degraded motherhood and the consequent tainted atmosphere of hundreds of our homes.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301770">True, honored womanhood, enlightened motherhood, and happy, comfortable homes can only be secured by concerted effort on the part of the women of our land. Individual effort has accomplished some good in this direction, but the mighty effect upon the masses unreached will be the result of our future united effort.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301771">In the month of July, 1895, Mrs, Josephine St.P. Ruffin of Boston called a three days' conference of colored women for personal exchange of greetings. This meeting did much to inspire and give life to the women whose privilege it was to be present; and the result of this gathering is a national organization of colored women, who have for their purpose the general development of women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301772">In the name of the National Federation of Afro-American Women, I call upon the women of the United States of America to lend us their influence, their interest and their aid.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301773">Our poor need to be fed and clothed. Our women must be taught to study for their own advancement.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301774" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1301775">They need inspiration and encouragement to keep a brave heart. Homemaking must be thought about, child-rearing needs attention. Our girls need social purity talks. They must be warned of evil company. They must be brought in closer touch with more that is good and pure. They must be taught to realize that they have a vital part to enact in developing the womanhood of their country.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301776">All topics of social, economic and intellectual reform must in turn receive a share of our interest. For these and other reasons we need to form local organizations for local reforms in the cities, in the towns, the villages and country districts of our land.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301777">We hope this call will touch many chords of hidden forces that will vibrate and respond, and thus our power as women of a national sisterhood will be strengthened and made more effective.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301778">Let every delegate of the national organization answer to this by her individual effort "to uplift, to inspire, to do, to look for the noble purposes of life, and hold them aloft as a banner where those who see its folds waving shall say, 'Behold the influence of goodness, of knowledge and of truth.'"</p><p xml:id="era2_1301779">In organizing our forces, we ask the hearty cooperation of the wives of our bishops and ministers, our professional women and other women who see the needs of our sisters and will seek to find a remedy.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301780">Any woman or body of women, after forming an organization with this end in view, founded upon a definite plan of work for a definite purpose, and having a president, secretary and other officers, if needed, may become a part of our National Federation by notifying the secretary, Mrs. Florida Ridley, 103 Charles street, Boston, Mass., or the president, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Tuskegee, Ala.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301781">Let us take the words of Milton, who said, "We go through weakness to the greatest strength," and we as a race of women may by constant progress attain that goal.

Lane</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_1301798">October 4, on the return of Mrs. B.T. Washington from the Atlanta Exposition she called a meeting of the club to discuss the propriety of a barroom in the Negro Building there.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301799">She described the bar, gave the supposed cause of its presence there, the present evil effects, those that will follow, and the lasting disgrace that the sale of intoxicants in this building will reflect upon the entire race.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301800">In the discussion that followed it was agreed that the barroom should be condemned, expressions made public and a sentiment created by the public against this evil that should be righted. A committee was appointed to draw resolutions denouncing the bar. It was decided further to send a copy to Commissioner Penn of the Negro Building, to others in charge of Exposition, and to certain papers for publication.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301801">Mrs. Josephine T. Washington was appointed chairman of committee, with Mrs. A. Logan and
Mrs. Martha Hurd Willis.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301802">The names of president and secretary of the club were affixed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301803">The Executive Committee of the Tuskegee Woman's Club, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Mrs. Josephine T. Washington, Mrs. N.B. Young and Miss M.M. Fleming, have arranged under various heads the following subjects for consideration of the club this first quarter: "Woman and her Work," "Education of Negro Girls," "The Temperance Movement," "The Status of the Negro Ministry," and "Robert Browning" -- life, characteristics of style, Browning Clubs in England.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301804">At the first literary meeting of the current year two phases of women's work were discussed. First, "Women in the Home," by Miss M.M. Fleming. She gave but little latitude for the woman in her home outside of the sacred precinct; but pictured the ideal woman in a home  -- worth having. "Woman in Business," by Miss Leonora L. Chapman introduced facts and portrayed the business capacity or the new woman with a zest that created a fervor in the breasts of those who are advocating some of her principles, if not her dress. On the evening of Oct. 7 the subject for discussion, "The Education of Negro Girls," was divided under eight heads. First, "The Early Education," by Miss Mattie Child, who recalled the days of toil and pain that attended those who struggled in secret for a little learning. "Present Methods," by Miss Milla Hadley gave a marked contrast over that of years ago and a corresponding feeling of thankfulness was aroused in her hearers.  "Defects in Present System," were strongly pointed out by Mrs. Young, who gave the danger of extremes, one-sidedness, and the lack of simple thoroughness in small things. "Suggestion for Future Improvement," by Miss Sarah Hunt were timely. Miss Hunt gave her hearers some of the benefits she received from her summer course taken at Cottage City. "Home Training," by Mrs. Irene Bond, struck a keynote that gave no uncertain sound, but vibrated throughout with the idea of its vital importance. "School Training," by Miss S. Belle Bransford prompted each member to the serious duties that are involved in the work of training our student girls. "Training for Society," by Miss Eliza Adams brought out more duties for mothers and others in training the daughters in habits of economy, in modesty, in uprightness and honesty in dealing with others.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301805">The discussion of current news of the week, introduced by Mrs. Sara Peake Greene, was deferred.

ful competitor, and will be California's representative in New York for the National Diamond Medal. The only reference to this young woman's color was when congratulations were being offered; a lady stepped forward and said, "I am a Southerner. Proud am I that by ability you've won, but prouder still to know your people sent such a matchless exponent. 'Tis no longer color that is the total barrier -- be qualified and competent."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301828">Probably the most important event before the Los Angeles women in October was the Woman's Parliament. The first day was devoted to  a symposium on dress: artistic dress, maternity dress, bicycle costume. A striking feature of the programme was an exhibition of a bicycle costume by Dr. Rose Talbot Bullard, showing the convenience and utility of her suit. The second day, woman suffrage was discussed from seven standpoints: Does the Wife Need It? Does the Mother Need It? Does the Unmarried Woman Need It? Does the Working Woman Need It? Does the Business Woman Need It? Does the Professional Woman Need It? Does Politics Need Woman Suffrage? I am certain no woman listening to these logical arguments longer questioned the need of the ballot for women. Mrs. Locke, of Pasadena, very cleverly handled the subject of artistic house furnishing, emphasizing the vital importance of making home beautiful and the available means within the reach of all to beautify their homes in this wonderfully beautiful land. At the close of the parliament women find themselves better fitted for the duties of home and the outside world, having gained by contact, social and intellectual, inspiration. The men, too, should have learned, atleast, that questions of importance can be thoroughly and intelligently discussed, and the point carried, without filibustering and confusion.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301829">At the last meeting of the Woman's Club the following officers were elected: president, Mrs. Katie Williams: vice-president, Mrs. Amanda Jones; secretary, Mrs. Lilla Williams; corresponding secretary, Miss J.B.

She came to the coast from Boston early in the '50's, and has required great wealth, estimated to be way up in the hundreds of thousands and some hint at a million. Although having agents to collect her rents and look after her investments, she always supervised and was recognized as one of the shrewdest and successful financiers of San Francisco. Mrs. Pleasance was lavish with her money and has educated and supported several girls of good birth and saved from failure a number of business men.

Among the strongest of human sensibilities is the love of parents for children, and when the law of heredity is accepted in its full force and, through this love observed, prison walls shall tremble, reformatories and refuges shall be institutions of the past, and man shall live in the full enjoyment of the Godliness within him.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301836">Numerous astute minds have dealt with the question, among them Mr. Galton, who has tabulated the judges of England through two hundred years, the prime ministers through one hundred years, and so on through three hundred families
<pb xml:id="era2_1301835" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
consisting of poets, musicians, divines, scholars, oarsmen and wrestlers. Of these three hundred families one thousand persons are eminent, four hundred and fifteen illustrious, and the general result is that one-half the eminent men have one or more eminent relations.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301837">Another striking example is given of a family of five hundred and forty members, traced through seven generations; all descended from a common thief, the greater number of whom died on the scaffold for theft or assassination. On one side of this family shameful death on the scaffold or torturing imprisonment stood a constant menace, on the other the reward of a free, honorable and respected life, yet neither was so powerful as to overcome that inborn tendency to crime.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301838">Distinctive genius or traits of character do not always appear to descend in a direct line; a generation or two may seem to lose the family bent, then a child is born giving evidence of the peculiarities of his grandparent or great grandparent. One way to account for this is by the Iaw of cross descent, that, as a rule, the mental qualities of the male progenitor descend to his female progeny, while the mental qualities of the female progenitor descend to her male progeny. It is often remarked that great men are seldom fathers of great sons. Another way to account for this is that the parent having the advantage of youth, health and mental activity will be reproduced in his child.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301839"> Ribot says that injudicious marriages are the cause of much of the degeneration in many families. In families of distinguished intellect it is found that there is a regular increase of power up to a culminating point, and as regular a decrease from that point. In the first case, marriages were consistent to its production, and in the latter they were incapable of preserving it.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301840">The history of the races of man shows that physical and mental laws coincide in their action. The Jew is today what he was in the time of Moses. True his complexion is modified under different climactic conditions, but it is only by a long course of training, under entirely new conditions, that the Hebrew becomes other than the typical son of his forefathers.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301841">Frederick William I., king of Prussia, recognized the fact that our peculiar bony structure, shape and size are an inheritance when he made it obligatory upon his soldiers to marry wives equal to themselves in stature, that he might secure a guard of giants.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301842">Certain diseases of the mind and body are set down by the medical profession as hereditary, such as insanity, gout, rheumatism, consumption and scrofula. Science attempts to regulate but does not promise to cure. These words occur in a leaflet from the Moral Education Society: "Conscientious physicians, who consider the moral as well as physical hygiene, are perplexed and in despair over the problem."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301843">It is true that environment and training may modify the natural condition of mind, but always at the expense  of greater energy and time than is necessary to overcome acquired habit. Hereditary traits have the great advantage of time. What circumstance of a life of twenty-five or fifty years could be so powerful as to overcome centuries of training?</p><p xml:id="era2_1301844">The most effectual training which the human soul can possible receive is given before birth. If this be of such a nature as to counteract probable evil tendencies, the labor and time consumed in creating a new mental condition is much lessened and possibly rendered unnecessary later on.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301845">In his treatise on the subject, Le Bon says: "Heredity governs the form of our body and its tendencies, the mind with its bent and its powers. It has placed in us those sentiments without which no society is possible, those intellectual aptitudes without which no civilization could have arisen.

It is a most gracious recognition of the refining and chastening influence of art in the life of the nation. The fierceness of politics, the strife of commerce, and the severities of religion all need the softening touch and ennobling influence of kindred arts.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301848">I wish that I might say a helpful word as to how art may be brought into our home life and
<pb xml:id="era2_1301847" n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
made to minister graciously to the higher needs of our better selves. No woman sufficiently realizes the sacredness of her trust and privileges as a home maker who is not always ambitious to make her home bright, beautiful and refined, as well as comfortable and convenient. The world of art, with all its joyousness, moral and suggestiveness and purities, is now within the reach of any home that would appropriate some of its treasures. Indeed it seems as if the entire art world, by the use of the decorator's skill, is assisting woman to understand and appreciate the uses of art in the simplest articles of home furnishing.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301849">The time was when art was haughty and exclusive and had no interest in or sympathy with the common people. It then lent itself only to palaces, churches and temples. The great masters felt that art was exalted only when the ceilings of some great cathedral or the walls of princely dwellings were decorated by their genius. Then it was that only the faces of saints, kings and the nobility were worthy to inspire the portrait artist. Then it was that art found more glory in portraying the triumphs of war than the laughing faces of childhood. But thanks to the growth of liberality in all things - thanks to the potencies of science and the humanizing influences of education - art is no longer the exclusive servant of the rich and noble. It now finds as much inspiration in the cottage as in the palace; it is as much glorified in portraying the face of a pure woman or an honest man as in painting the faces of saints or sickly princes. In short, art has become the ardent lover of humanity, seeking in every way to glorify our lives.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301850">As an illustration of this fact, the pictures of the Columbia Exposition will at once come before the mind, and we will recall that the most popular and prized pictures in all the departments were those which represented the most ordinary incidents in human life. Take, for example, the picture entitled "Breaking Home Ties," made particularly pathetic by the recent heroic death of the celebrated artist who painted it. The artist here has seized upon one of the saddest incidents in family life - that is, the first break in the family union. The universal interest in this canvas was not so much due to its size, coloring or artistic finish as to the powerful representation of one of the tenderest sorrows of family experience. The artist has told here in a wonderfully impressive way the simple story of the power of a mother's love and the sacred influences of a good home.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301851">If any of us have denied to the Indian any feelings of sentiment, there was a small picture in the United States section capable of correcting this opinion. The artist here represents an Indian stooping to take a water lily from the pond. This seems a very simple incident to claim the attention of an artist, yet the idea sought to be conveyed is a large and instructive one. The grim visaged brave is returning from a hunt with all the evidences of his savage butchery of bird and beast about him, yet the sight of the lily seems for the moment to change his whole nature, transforming his savagery into tenderness and his thirst for blood into a love for the beautiful. The spirit of humanity in this picture appeals to us so powerfully that we lose sight of the savage and feel only the touch of kinship with all who are moved to pay homage to God's gifts of the beautiful in nature.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_07.11" type="Report"><head rend="center">TEXAS.</head><docAuthor>Cora L.

Washington, whose address at the opening of the Cotton States Exposition excited more comment than any other of the day. Being a typical Negro, his grent qualifications cannot be attributed to his Caucasian ancestors. It was a sight to gladden the hearts of his race, to see him standing upon the platform, the cynosure of all eyes and surrounded by the pride and chivalry of the south, delivering an address to the very people who thirty years ago held his people in bondage and refused to believe that they were made for anything but serfdom. Truly, a new era is dawning upon us, and we should he glad and eager to recognize it. Of course, some of us do not agree altogether with some of his utterances, but every man has a right to his own convictions and they should be expected. For instance, Mr. Washington warns us against trying to spend our dollar in an opera house. Now, while it is certainly the best thing for us to be economical and less profligate, yet I can't see why we should be debarred from spending our money to see a good play, such as Shakespeare's tragedies, in which there is a world of instruction, any more than our more fortunate Caucasian brother. We certainly should be allowed to spend our money which we have earned, in any harmless way we may see fit, even though it be an opera house. Nevertheless, we all know that it is best to save all that we can, for there is no doubt but that the much talked of negro problem call only be solved by our growing intelligence and wealth. A man with money can do much more for his country, his race and himself than one without this necessary adjunct. Therefore we must get wealth. Get wisdom, but with all our getting, get wealth.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301856">It was a day for much rejoicing when our legislature in extra session declared against prize fighting. We need our great state advertised, but not in that way. We repudiate the advertisement which other states refuse and which Dallas seemed determined to thrust upon us.

His most recent agitation is caused by a modest hope expressed by the WOMAN'S ERA that at the first gathering of the newest federation of women's clubs, now known as the "National Federation of Afro-American Women," the name will be changed, as it is a misnomer. Now it is much easier to give reasons for our objection to the name, "Afro-American," than to give the correct "form," as is demanded of us "honor bright." Boston people, whoare accused by the <hi rend="italic">Age</hi> editor of insisting "that they are something else than what they are, "are too busy rolling unnecessary words around under their tongues, be they ever so euphonious, and too conscientious to put counterfeit labels on anything. So because the appellation is cumbersome, unbusinesslike, and the use of it will help create proscription by more widely dividing and serregating a class that has as much right as any in the country to be known as Americans, without affix or excuse, we decline to be a party to this latest stamp act and decline to name this child until the coming leisure age gives time for the ethnologists to examine, divide, sub-divide and name the rest of the component parts that help make up the conglomeration known as the great American people. It is, however, earnestly hoped that it will not be necessary to wait for the critical analysis to be made before convincing those who now seem so anxious to prove themselves less American than others, that a people with two or three generations of ancestors born on the soil, many with an admixture of the blood of the Aborigines coursing through their veins, have as much, if not more right than any to be known simply as Americans. Until it becomes necessary to particularize (as it often does) the descriptive affix "colored" will fill the bill and cover the ground. So, with due respect for the antiquities, we must continue to reject the hyphenation, Afro-American, even though it is "a Latinization used by the Assyrians before the name of Christ," and still insist it is a misnomer when applied to all Americans who are colored.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_07.13.02" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">A CLUB MODEL.</head><p xml:id="era2_1301864">Many women are desirous of forming Clubs who, from lack of time or opportunity, have not been able to study the methods of successful clubs now in good working order. From such many requests have come. In giving a "club model," not "model club," we can do no better than to cite the methods of our own club, referring our readers to the reports from such clubs as the Loyal Union, the Washington League, the Kansas City League, for other and different models. Every club must work out its own salvation; adapt itself to the peculiar needs of its members. As has often been said, the Woman's Era, which is composed of nearly one hundred and fifty women, is divided into committees, every member being put upon some one of the committees, of literature, civics, philanthropy, domestic science, race work, etc. Each committee takes charge of a meeting in turn, selecting an essayist, and these are to discuss the particular matter which is to be put before the club. The club has the usual officers, with an executive board, which maps out the work of the year and presents it to the club in the form of a printed programme. Some one committee may choose to have a public meeting with public speakers, some one to have it "tea," some an entertainment to raise funds. "The ways they are many, the end it is one." Many of the clubs of other cities carry on large and flourishing industrial classes, where cooking, darning, patching are done; some, including the Era, have classes in literature, music, etc.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1301865" n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1301866">Any body of women will find so many avenues opening to them that, having once started, they will need no leading.

In commenting upon this, the <hi rend="italic">Boston Herald</hi> cites it as an instance of the ignorant class outvoting the intelligent class. To the unprejudiced person, this movement on the part of the colored women to obtain representation on the school board is an evidence of their earnestness and intelligence, and the sneer at ignorance is misplaced.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301870">One of the most interesting incidents of the suffrage movement here in Boston is the desire to vote expressed by two inmates of the Home for Aged Colored Women, one of whom is ninety-two years of age and the other eighty-eight, and the spirited, intelligent letter sent by these old ladies to the suffrage leaders speaks volumes, particularly when it is realized that they have had no advantages in the way of education and environment.

This was considered one of the hardest, if not the most difficult subject under discussion. Mrs. DePriest was equal to the occasion. She spoke with ease and crowded much thought into her five-minute paper. The subject was treated from an ethical standpoint, showing in many instances why conclusions deduced from reading magazine articles, reviews, and newspapers were false and not conformable to true progress. Mrs. DePriest said in part: "Only when the motive, intention, and apparent purpose of an act is known, and when a calm and comprehensive survey of the subject is taken, have we any right to express conclusions and then they must be placed on the broad ground of right."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301876">Mrs. DePriest, who was an agreeable surprise to the women, is a graduate of the Denver High School, and is corresponding secretary of the Woman's League.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301877">Among the other papers was one by Mrs. Lizzie Olden, the other colored delegate, who is president of tile Woman's League. She talked upon "The Club as a Factor in Bettering Social and Civic Conditions." Mrs. Olden said that grave problems were pressing upon society with such a force that one almost looks to the future with fear. In the day when the republic was in danger from rebellion, the moral support of the women was not less efficient than the bayonets of the men in settling the difficulty. In the new conflict of mental and social forces the women must come to the front again. Social conditions will never be better or purer than the best women of a community. She said: "Those who are called our best women have little right to their title unless they make use of their talents and their leisure for the benefit of the community."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301878">Mr. Olden's address was frequently applauded.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301879">The two ladies were the guests of Mrs. Dr. Solly, one of the wealthiest and most prominent club women of Colorado Springs.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301880">Thursday afternoon, August 3, the Woman's League gave an informal reception to the teachers and visitors who still remained in Denver.

Williams</docAuthor><p xml:id="era2_1301907">New Orleans, La., Oct. 11, 1895.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301908">The club originated in the necessity which I saw all around me, of doing something to elevate the race, especially its women. I have been, for twenty years, principal of a public school for girls, and try as I would, I could not succeed to my entire satisfaction in making real true women of many of my girls, because my influence did not extend far enough into their lives. I therefore thought of working upon the morals of the mothers, the majority of whom were poor and ignorant and could not give to their girls the home culture proportionate to their educational advantages. For years I have felt that something ought to be done, but just how to reach them I did not know. I wanted help, but did not know where to turn to find it. At last the club idea dawned upon me. It was a happy one. I consulted some of my personal friends, and by coaxing and begging others, we succeeded in getting enough together to organize.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301909">The object is plainly stated in the first article of our constitution, wherein we declare that we will do all that our hands find to do toward elevating and helping our women. Every intelligent, respectable woman is eligible to membership; the dues are only five cents per month, with no initiation fee. The dues were purposely made so small that no one could offer the expense as a plea for not joining us. The result is that we now number seventy good responsible women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301910">The club is divided into twelve committees, every member belonging to one or more of them. The appointments are not arbitrary; each one chooses the committee she prefers. This is allowed so that each one will work with more zeal when interested in the work. The Temperance, Anti-Cigarette, Suffrage and Social Purity committees preach their respective doctrines, scatter reading matter and form leagues of all who take anyone of the pledges. The Literature, History and Law committees form classes in the club, for our own benefit and improvement. The Self Help committee are organizing free sewing schools all over the city to teach poor girls how to sew, but especially how to mend, darn and patch, for I find that many of them go in rags because they do not know how to use the needle. Each member of the club pledges herself to furnish two ready made garments during the year, and we propose to solicit aid from our friends so as to be able to have, at least, one new made garment to distribute to each one of our poor by Christmas. The Philanthropy committee devote their time to prisons and houses of correction; they give sympathy, advice, and reading matter to the inmates. We propose to enlist the interest of the colored lawyers to look into cases where we have reason to believe that injustice or undue severity has been exercised in their sentences. The Hospital committee has charge of visiting the sick in the hospital and at their homes, where they give whatever aid they can. Of the free night schools, we had one in operation all last term and will soon open others. They are open to all young people who are compelled to work in the day and cannot afford to pay for their schooling. The Committee on Newspapers and Current Events search the papers and magazines for all articles, either commendatory or derogatory to us as a race or as women. These are brought to the notice of the club, which endorses them as the case requires.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301911">I have given you an outline of our work. Of course we are somewhat hampered for want of funds, but as we have considerable talent among us, we are preparing to give an entertainment for the benefit of our treasury.</p><byline>Sylvanie F.

Gould</docAuthor><byline>Medora W. Gould</byline><p xml:id="era2_1301913">Mr. Zangwill, whose letters in the <hi rend="italic">Cosmopolitan</hi>are such a fund of information, is thus described by a friend. "Mr. Zangwill has a lovable personality and is a delightful companion. He is a brilliant talker, for he does not save all his good things for his books, and he likes to listen as well as talk. His sweetness of disposition remained untouched by the hard grind of his youth, and it is unspoiled by his present success. Ho possesses the quaintest of humor, the dryest of wit and the keenest appreciation of good qualities in others. In spite of his enthusiasm in anything in which he is interested, and an often childlike enjoyment of little things, the sorrows and the injustice of human lives have sunk deep into his heart. He is in his thirty-second year. It is not strange that people think of him as much older. Personally he might be described as an ungainly man, awkward and unconventional in dress and movements, with dark, irregular features, a mop of curly black hair, and large, pathetic, near-sighted eyes."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301914">Walter Besant is an advocate of the theory that novel writing can be learned like any other profession by anyone of ordinary ability, with due exercise of intelligence and industry. He is much interested in a sort of school conducted by prominent novelists, in which the manuscript of young authors is read and criticised, defects pointed out, and helpful and practical advice given toward improvement. In some cases the writer is advised to withdraw from a hopeless struggle.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301915">"Religion in Common Life," a volume of sermons by various ministers, indicates that the pulpit is giving to the people something other than creeds and dogmas. Among the topics presented are "Individualism and Socialism," "Phases of Idleness," "Problems of the Poor," and "Religion and Politics."</p><p xml:id="era2_1301916">"Ave Maria," by Miss Marie Louise Burgess of Boston, is an interesting story of love and devotion. It is a tale of the conflict between love and duty, in which love is sacrificed on the altar of faith. The neatness and correctness of the printing and the taste displayed in the binding make it an attractive little volume.</p><p xml:id="era2_1301917">Edgar AllenPoe possessed the power of prophecy, for in a letter written by him in 1844 occurred this passage: "I perceived that the country could not fail of affording in a few years a larger proportionate amount of readers than any upon earth.

all our women, individuals as well as organizations, took this means of coming before the colored women of the country, particularly as there is ground for every hope at this time that all the various bodies of colored women of the country will merge into one grand organization that the entire country will respect. A council committee representing the National Colored Woman's League and the National Federation of Afro-American Women, met, and after agreeing upon the basis of union to be submitted in joint convention next year, agreed as to the wisdom of meeting in Nashville, and will doubtless urge a full attendance on the part of the bodies in question on that occasion in the hope of final union of all forces. Mrs. Thurman, chairman of the Atlanta Congress being most enthusiastic in favor of union of all forces.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302164">The gathering was very harmonious, and takes its place as one of the most notable gatherings ever convened in Atlanta. It proved a revelation to colored and white alike, and will serve as a strong argument as to woman's power in pointing the way to needed reforms in the future in the south. Unlike most gatherings of the kind in which our women take part, everyone was on the alert and quick at repartee. Some of the brightest women of the country were present, and many excellent papers were read and discussed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302165">There were three sessions daily, all well attended. The south will be greatly <choice><sic>benefitted</sic><corr>benefited</corr></choice> by the object lesson indicated by this gathering. It will have a most beneficial effect upon our women, who, heretofore, have never advanced to the front save through religious channels ; indeed, have taken but little stock in such undertakings. If the women of the south have been indifferent, it has been through lack of experience, and, likely, confidence in the ultimate good to be accomplished by such movements. As a rule our women of all sections have been discouraged by our men in any and all attempts at public work, the result being lack of real progressiveness all around. It was a splendid gathering. Many of those who labored for the First National Convention of Colored Women in Boston last summer were present and labored zealously for the good of the Congress. Judging by the general conduct of the delegates, the attendance, and the quality of the papers read, too much praise cannot be bestowed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302166">At great expense and personal sacrifice, delegates came from parts remote, and be it said to the credit of all concerned, that with but one or two exceptions, all participating preceded upon most liberal grounds. The women were thoroughly in earnest, as will be shown by the resolutions, which are claimed by some leading Atlanteans, both black and white, to have been the backbone of the Congress, and in every way fitting.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302167">Sample copies of the WOMAN'S ERA were scattered freely at every session, many declaring themselves highly pleased with its appearance and promising support from the January number. As is usual is such affairs, the expenses attendant upon visiting the exposition were exceedingly great. No effort was made to secure any very great reductions in board for the delegates, this constituting one of the most unpleasant features. But a beginning has been made in the south where the great masses are, and that beginning is of such character that we are sanguine that ere long we will all see one magnificent body of women, with their hearts inflamed with the common intent to uplift one struggling race.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302168">Many prominent men of both races visited the sessions, many making short speeches. Hon. I. Garland Penn, Dr. E.W.E. Bowen, Dr. Thirkield, President of Gammon Theological School, Hon. J.C. Napier, Prof. Booker T. Washington, of Tuskegee, Bishops Turner, Grant and Gains, Dr. Jennifer, Prof. R.R. Wright, T. Thomas Fortune, Mrs. Thompson of Syracuse, zealous worker for S.P.A., and Sister Jane Moore of Little Rock were among many others.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302169">Bostonians will remember Mrs. Dr. Butler, of Atlanta, who fairly captivated the hearts of the National Federation of Afro-American Women last summer. Her address of welcome was in every way worthy the impression she then made. The response was made by Mrs. Rosetta Lawson, who from the beginning has labored indefatigably for the success of the Congress.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1302170" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1302171">Our old friend, Mrs. Pitts of St. Louis, the "Lafe Pence" of the Boston meeting, fully sustained her reputation by supporting all practical measures.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302172">Mrs. B.T. Washington, Mrs. Fannie Barrier Williams, and Prof. Mary V. Cook attracted especial attention.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302173">The chairman, Mrs. Lucy Thurman, who represented the W.C.T.U. at the late World's Conference in England, and Mrs. T.H.L. Lyles, who has been laboring for many years for the erection of a suitable monument to John Brown's memory, proved themselves to be powerful extemporaneous speakers.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302174">Mrs. Lyles has given several years to the work of raising funds for a monument as aforesaid, having secured an act of incorporation for the John Brown Monument Association under the laws of the State of Minnesota, and filing a bond for $10,000, has by her unceasing efforts and most laudable zeal attracted the attention of the governor of her state, who pledges practical and important interest, providing she is able to raise a certain amount. It was the sense of the Congress that we stand more in need of institutions, educational and reformatory, than a marble tribute to show our esteem. The proposition was made to purchase, establish and maintain a home farm, for dependent and helpless children, in that section raising the most money for the memorial. Mrs. Lyles has had her heart set for years upon a monument, but showed her unselfishness by accepting the verdict of the Congress as her will. It is a glorious augury for our future, to know that we have in our ranks at this time such women as Mrs. Lyles. The Congress stands pledged to support the movement, and the WOMAN's ERA will open its columns to all who wish to aid the cause.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302175">Mrs. J. St. Pierre Ruffin's absence was a source of great disappointment. Many looked for Mrs. Helen Cook and others who helped to make the First National Convention of Colored Women famous. Many of them not otherwise represented sent most excellent papers. Mrs. Ella L. Mahammit's was read by Mrs. Rosetta Lawson.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302176">At the adjournment, flowers were presented to the chairman and secretary.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_09.03" type="Report"><head rend="center">THE NEGRO AT ATLANTA EXPOSITION.</head><docAuthor>Mrs. Arthur S.

The work of the Art Amateur Society has received much praise. The most attractive feature of the District exhibit is a statue six feet high on a pedestal three feet high. It is the work of W.C. Hill and represents the condition of the Negro today, "Chains Broken but Not Off." It is a representation of a typical Negro, large and muscular, struggling to free himself of the effects of slavery. This piece of work has received favorable comment for the originality of design and its splendid execution. A combination centre table, work table, and writing desk by H.A. Jackson has received highest praise. Mrs. M.A. Langston received a bronze medal for her embroidery and upholstering.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302179">The patents of Negro inventors from the U.S. Patent Office are showing what the Negro is doing along that line.

The exhibition of the Negro at Atlanta has done much toward opening the eyes of the world as to the capabilities and accomplishments of the race. Many who opposed the exhibit at first are now frank to say that they are sorry they did not lend their support. The people and the press have been unanimous in their praise of this worthy effort. It serves as an inspiration to those who have lost hopes of the Negro accomplishing anything in this country. And yet, we are safe in saying, that this exhibit did not consist of the best work done by the race nor did it have the support of one-third of the influential people in the respective sections.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302225">What might we not have done had we united support?</p></div><div xml:id="era2_09.04" type="Report"><head rend="center">COLORADO.</head><docAuthor>Elizabeth Piper Ensley</docAuthor><byline>Elizabeth Piper Ensley, Editor.</byline><p xml:id="era2_1302226">A glance backward causes us to rejoice over the gains Woman Suffrage has made in this and other countries during the past year. Utah makes the third star in our suffrage flag, and South Australia has fully enfranchised its women. That public sentiment is growing in this direction is evident, since a Woman Suffrage amendment has been submitted to the constitution by the state legislatures of New York, Oregon, Idaho, Nevada and California. Can the result of the vote on the referendum in Massachusetts be discouraging, when one out of every three men and twenty-five out of every twenty-six women, who expressed their opinions on the question, were in favor of equal suffrage? State suffrage societies have been organized in Idaho, Montana, North Dakota, Nevada, Arizona, Oklahoma, New Mexico, West Virginia and Delaware. We hope for splendid results the coming year.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302227">The exercise of suffrage stimulates women to venture outside of the narrow circle in which they formerly worked. I recently had an interview with a lady who was an active worker in our suffrage campaign, and who is now president of the Bonita Cold and Silver Mining Company, an organization officered by women. She said:</p><p xml:id="era2_1302228">"You ask me how I first came to think of the 'Woman's Mine.' I hardly know just when the idea took shape and crystallized into its present form. My mother was the 'Lady Bountiful' of our village, and after I grew to womanhood, my personal experience brought home to me the need of some business making it possible for women of the most limited means to invest in something which would bring them quick, sure and steady returns; this, too, without leaving home and children, or whatever work they might be doing for a livelihood. It was really the result of observation, brought by my work for universal suffrage. An instance which came under my notice some years ago will make it clear.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302229">"A woman from Illinois invested quite largely in one of the best mines in Colorado. When it began to pay handsomely, the other owners, all men, decided to 'freeze her out,' in mining parlance. They made false reports, --  no ore, etc. -- finally shut down and stopped work; but the lady did not 'freeze out' and having money as well as courage, compelled the other owners to divide and treat her fairly.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302230">"I thought then, 'Why not have a woman's mine?' Today I offer you that in the Bonita Gold and Silver Mining Company, organized in New Mexico and Colorado.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302231">"Some years ago I asked my husband to give me a mine to manage myself. He said that he would. Occasionally I would ask, 'Where is my mine?' He would say, 'Wait till I get it in good shape.' Last October, in the midst of the excitement preceding the election, when every woman I wanted to see was canvassing for the different parties, my husband handed me the deed to the Bonita, saying, 'Here is your mine; the deed is recorded, title absolute and without flaw, not one dollar of indebtedness, patent work all done, ready to make the application, with nearly eight thousand dollars' worth of work done as carefully and economically as I could do it; apex on every claim, with timber, water and all that makes a first class property, and now within about fifty feet of an immense body of ore, running from fifty to one thousand dollars to the ton, the average two hundred and fifty. A mine! Not a mere prospect at the grass roots.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302232">"'Now see what you can do as a woman's company. If you can keep six men steadily at work, you ought to have pay in from sixty to ninety days.'</p><p xml:id="era2_1302233">"This I want to do. We need only about five thousand dollars for patents and all, after which we expect to pay a dividend and that from that time the mine will pay its own expenses.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302234">"I am charmed with the ERA. A glance at it shows its status and scope. It has finely gotten up in all respects - its personal appearance, very distinct individuality, the pictures, and the ability with which it is edited.

Both these are events which go to make up history and demand more than passing attention.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302242">The attitude of the ERA on the question of a "Negro exhibit" is well known. It has been open to conviction. We did not believe it possible to make a Negro exhibit that was truly representative; that the interests of the races are so amalgamated its to be impossible to separate them to make an exhibit that would show the present status of the race. More than this we feared and realized the possibility of attendant evils and personal mortifications for which nothing in the way of an imposing exhibit could compensate. At the same time we realized that many of our most thoughtful people endorsed the movement and saw in it a large opportunity. The results are before the reader. The separate exhibit attracted much attention and favorable comment. The Colored Woman's Congress brought together a large number of progressive women and gave an additional impetus to the woman's movement, beside opening up possibilities for the future.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302243">The Congress held by our women at Atlanta was a notable one, not only in its personal make-up, but also in the value of the work that was done -- the subjects discussed, the papers read. It was not, however, the first congress; that held in Boston last July enjoys that distinction. Our women have caught the fever, and there is everything good to be hoped for in their efforts toward union and concentration.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_09.06.02" type="Editorial"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">SOME INFORMATION CONCERNING JACKS</seg>, THE LETTER WRITER.</head><p xml:id="era2_1302244">One Of the editors of <hi rend="italic">The Christian Educator</hi>, the organ of the Freedman's Aid and Southern Education Society, has been at some pains to locate and learn something definite of the man Jacks, who wrote the shameful letter to Miss Balgarnie of England in March last.

Praises for the excellence of her work were heard on all sides, and congratulations were showered upon her by the most competent judges of this branch of instruction. The Woman's Educational and Industrial Union, under whose auspices Miss Syphax went, volunteered not only to pay for the transportation of the articles from Washington, but also to defray all the expenses of Miss Syphax if she would come to explain her work.

The bride is the only daughter of Mrs. Lavinia Lee and the one living granddaughter of Mrs. Mary Jones and the late John Jones of this city.

The scheme of color carried out both in house decorations and costumes was pink and white. The bride wore a heavy ivory satin, without train. The waist was trimmed with plaited white chiffon and heavily embroidered in pearls. Her veil was fastened with a diamond ornament, the gift of the groom. The maid of honor, Miss Elizabeth Seals of Cleveland, is a young lady of stately beauty and many social graces. She wore a beautiful and artistic gown of taffeta silk, Dresden design. The bridesmaids were the two prettycousins of the bride, Miss Etta Brown of Detroit and Miss Mabel Wheeler of this city. They were prettily costumed in mousseline de soie over pink silk and carried bridesmaid's roses. The bride's mother, Mrs. Lee, wore black satin trimmed with heliotrope velvet.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302289">The groom was attended by Mr. Andrew J. Stevens of Philadelphia as best man, and Messrs.

Carefully prepared papers were read on "Ventilation," by Mrs. Fannie Johnson, on the proper care of cooking utensils by Mrs. Pope, food preparations by Miss Simmons, and on decorations, wise and otherwise, by Mrs. Ruffin. Short discussions followed all the papers. A special meeting will be held in charge of the civic section, when the club and their friends will listen to a talk by Mrs. Ellen A. Richardson, editor of <hi rend="italic">Business Folio</hi>, on the advantage of a business training for women, and she will also tell something of the work and aim of the Floral Emblem Society. The meeting will be held in the Revere St. Chapel.

It was journalists' day, and was wittily presided over by Mrs. Gosse. The different newspaper women told what they knew of the different departments of newspaper work. Bright papers, laughable stories, music and flowers galore, with the usual "high tea " in the beautiful crystal parlors of the Parker House, filled the afternoon and evening with delight.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302433">The Woman's Club House Corporation will tender a reception to Mrs. E.M.H.

Godwin, Hemmings, W.H. Jackson, H.P. Johnson, Payne, Peake, C. L. Smith and J.R. Jackson were at home to friends Monday evening, the 17th, at the Grundmann Studios, Copley Sq., and welcomed their friends to one of the most delightful entertainments ever given in Boston. The spacious halls, reception rooms, and promenades were beautiful and inviting in their elaborate decorations, and the bachelors all attentiveness and courtesy. Copley Hall was hung with white and pink bunting, the ceiling being all in white, through which the electric lights shone with a soft, mellow light which was universally becoming. The walls were draped with laurel, and the stage set with palms and ferns. In the great smoking room were rugs, couches and hangings galore, and to crown all a huge wood fire. It is not strange that with such a setting the costumes of the ladies showed to perfection and that the scene was one of unusual beauty. There were many beautiful gowns worn for the first time, conspicuous among them those worn by two attractive "buds," Misses Genevieve Lee and Elizabeth Hemmings. Miss Lee, who has manner of unusual charm, was very attractive in white silk and spangled chiffon, made decollete, and decorated with white rosebuds. Miss Hemmings could not have worn anything more becoming to her than her perfectly simple dress of white Swiss muslin, undecorated save for the ribbon at the waist and those which held the gown on the shoulders.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302439">The young ladies who acted  as ushers were Miss Lillian Lewis, in white and blue, Miss Gray, in white over pink, Miss Grant, in white and violet, Miss Hare, in yellow, Miss Harriet Smith, in yellow, Miss Trotter, in pink, Miss Hemmings and Miss Watson, in white with violets.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302440">Every bachelor, from those who received the guests at their carriages to those who received in line, did his utmost for the pleasure of his guests. A reception and a musicale by the bachelors occupied the early part of the evening. These were followed by supper and dancing, and all left believing it would be a long time before the Bachelors' At Home would be surpassed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302441">Several New Bedford girls came up to the Bachelors', Miss Gertie Piper, Miss Wilson and Miss Carter being among them.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302442">Mrs. Joseph Lee was distinctively elegant in black and silver.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302443">Mrs. Dandridge was, as usual, very stylish in pearl brocade.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302444">Mrs. Wilson wore her wedding dress, cream faille.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302445">Miss De Mortie carried off with her usual distinction her dress of pale blue silk with trimmings of white and pink.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302446">Mrs. Grant wore white silk and white chiffon.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302447">Mrs. J.H.

hard matter to leave with enough money to take one home again. The girls are such talkers that the money almost walks from the young men's pockets.  Miss Kate Smith is one of the most successful of these talkers. I know from past visits to fairs at which we have met.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302461">Wedding bells will begin soon after Easter, and goodness only knows when they will stop their sweet chiming, from the number of engagements we hear of. Well, health and happiness to them all. Mr. Robert is still looking Jerseyward, but I heard they were on the "outs." No doubt nothing more or less than a lover's quarrel. Charlie Moore has stolen the heart of a fine little girl, much to the disappointment of one of the older girls who had great anticipations. But never mind, dearie, this is leap year, so make your choice. Our lovely Lottie is also on the list of those whom we expect soon to congratulate. Mr. Miller must be very proud of his success in securing the coveted prize. How she will be missed by the girls in their frolics.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302462">Very soon I suppose we will hear something definite from Miss Alice Greenly and Miss Walker.

Mr. King, the baritone, did not make a very good impression, for his first appearance in New York. After the concert came the farce, "My Neighbor's Wife," characterized by the Misses Nichols, Greenly and Ford, also Messrs. E.T. Attwell, Frank Chambers and R.M. Attwell. The acting showed careful preparation, and everything went off without a hitch. How noticable it was that the ladies and gentlemen of the "inner circles" were not up to the dances. This winter's dances were all Greek to them. All the ladies looked charming, but I must speak especially of the toilettes of Misses Eva Walker and Alice Greenly. I think they were Louis XV coats  -- at least some one said so.

Nowell Ford played a difficult piano solo so fast that one could get no sense nor enjoyment from it. The dear girl was affected with stage fright, I guess.

Washington, President of the National Federation of Afro-American Women, the organization which grew out of the said convention, conferred with Helen Cook, 1st, vice president of the convention, and president of the National League which desired union, as to the possibility of uniting the two organizations in one grand body, and as a result accepted the latter's proposition;
<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>: That a committee of three, headed by the president of each organization, be selected by said presidents to form a "conference committee" which should meet at a given place for the purpose of consultation and agreement as to a basis of union, the same to be submitted in joint convention for united action, looking to final union. This plan differed from one submitted by Mrs. Victoria Matthews, chairman of executive committee of the National Federation, but in the interest of harmony that lady withdrew her plan.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302470">After subsequent correspondence it was decided by the two presidents to hold Conference Committee in Atlanta. It was expected that Mrs. Cook would be present, but she delegated her powers to Miss Lucy Moten, of Washington, D.C. Many ladies of the Atlanta Woman's Congress, in their earnest desire to see harmony be-

tween the two bodies, requested the privilege of having said congress represented on this committee, for the purpose of attesting their unbiased and perfectly neutral attitude. After much discussion and consideration by the parties most interested, it was finally agreed to extend the courtesy, particularly as the presence of an outside presiding officer would tend to put the two national organizations on an equal footing. This action was unanimously accepted by the conference committee as fair and in order. Miss Moten, acting for the National League, appointed  Mrs. Ida C. Bailey of Washington, and Miss Anna Jones of Kansas City to serve with her. Mrs. Washington appointed Mrs. Pitts of Missouri and Mrs. V. Matthews of New York; the congress appointing Mrs. Emma Ford of Michigan, Mrs. Arthur S. Gray and Mrs. Rossetta Lawson of Washington. Mrs. Ford was chosen to preside ; Mrs. Pitts as secretary.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302471">Mrs. Matthews moved that courtesy be extended the National League in the matter of opening discussion upon the question at issue. Miss Moten declined on the ground that she was uninstructed and preferred to hear what suggestion the Federation would make. Mrs. Washington directed Mrs. Matthews to speak for the National Federation. Mrs. Matthews playfully referred to the strategic point gained by Miss Moten. She outlined the plan as proposed to her in Washington at a personal meeting with Cook, and clearly stated that she approved the plan, which was as follows: 1. Both names be discarded and a new one chosen which should represent the new Union; all agreed.  2. Both constitutions be discarded and a new one formulated; agreed. 3. A joint call to be issued in the ensuing year for a joint convention, before which the foregoing suggestions should be submitted for united action, favorable or otherwise; agreed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302472">In the friendly informal discussion which followed, various minor points were touched upon; for instance, it was suggested that the new name be The National Federation of Colored Women. Of course all understood that the committee had no jurisdiction in the matter, but merely suggested it in order to arouse popular discussion on the subject, all agreeing to differ according to understanding of the principle involved.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302473">The official organ of the National Federation was also discussed conjointly. Its present form was objected to, the understanding being that an editorial change was desired, i.e., fewer editors and more reports as to the work of organized bodies of women; that the paper should be so supported as to give space for light literature, essays, fiction, etc. Mrs. Matthews spoke for the ERA and said that the ERA was prepared to make suggested changes, in fact those identical points had been discussed by the editor-in-chief, who went further by suggesting that the editorship be an elective one, and that the national organization form an incorporated society for the purpose of owning the paper. The management of the <hi rend="italic">Woman's Journal</hi> of Boston, and other papers, were discussed. Like the name, this too was left to the decision of the women in joint convention. Mrs. Matthews believed that our women had an opportunity of establishing a clean, chaste paper at very little cost. It could easily be done by the clubs composing the Federation guaranteeing the cost of publishing per issue, the clubs being taxed per ratio, and in return every member of the Federation would be entitled to a paper free. All agreed that the latter plan was exceedingly practical. Miss Moten stated many things, which from her point of view detracted from the ERA'S reputation for unbiased dealing with public questions, her language being decidedly strong, but she was willing, she said, to modify her views providing the changes suggested would be adopted in the future. Mrs. Matthews replied that the whole question hinged upon the quality of support which the colored women of the country would give the paper. The matter of making public the work accomplished by this committee was then broached. It was informally considered wise to report privately, but there must have been a misunderstanding on this point as every point covered was commonly discussed an hour or two later, and these extracts from my note book are herewith given to THE WOMAN'S ERA for the information of all persons desiring the same.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302474">The conference committee was remarkably <choice><sic>harmonius</sic><corr>harmonious</corr></choice>; not a jar, save when the minor discussion concerning the ERA obtruded itself.

Instructions were given our Chairman of the Executive Committee concerning this matter and that of uniting with The National League. As we earnestly desired harmony and union our best counsellors advised and urged delay on our constitution and by-laws on the ground that when union was effected a new constitution would of necessity be required; further that no constitution would be adequate to cover our needs as a national body that was not constructed upon the constitutions of the various bodies comprising the Federation, our policy being opposed upon principle to any constitution otherwise constructed for the reason that only by knowing and providing for the various objects of the clubs comprising the Federation could we hope to become a truly representative body of Afro-American Women. Sorrow and affliction in our official family caused general retardation. Our position as a dignified self-respecting body is one of gravity. Our constitution as adopted at the Boston convention stood thus:</p><p xml:id="era2_1302479">NAME -- ARTICLE I.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302480">This organization is and shall hereafter be known as The National Federation of Afro-American Women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302481">OBJECT -- ARTICLE II.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302482">The object of this organization is: (1.) The concentration of the dormant energies of the women of the Afro-American race into one broad band of sisterhood; for the purpose of establishing needed reforms, and the practical encouragement of all efforts being put forth by various agencies, religious, educational, ethical and
otherwise, for the upbuilding, ennobling and advancement of the race. (2).

It made no provision for the necessary correspondence. Your officers have been slow to act in order to study the most progressive methods of procedure in use among National bodies. Officially we expected to communicate through our official organ, but unfortunately the clubs composing the National Federation have not systematically ordered sufficient numbers of the ERA to guarantee the expense, not only of necessary communications, but of the work done and fully reported in our memorable convention number. This is a sad confession, but we make it in the hope that our women will pause and thoughtfully consider, first, that any organization founded upon other than common business principles must fail; secondly, we are before the public; critics, friends and disinterested parties, men and women of both races are watching us and naturally expecting results; and thirdly, the expense of our meeting in Boston, the communications that have since been given space in our official organ, has been paid by some one or is still hanging over the paper; and lastly, we, The National Federation

of Afro-American Women, not only have it in our power to establish before the world the first and only paper owned and published by Afro-American women, but we can own it and through its columns let the world see what manner of women we are. Our women will need no argument as to the advantage in having as our official organ a paper so well established as to literary merit, as the WOMAN'S ERA, and we consider it absolutely necessary for the perfecting of our organization, as a means of communicating with associate clubs, that we urge upon the officers of alI women's clubs, unions, etc., that they send a monthly letter as to the work carried on by the clubs or unions, and to specify the number of copies per month that respective club or union will order. This is practical. It is necessary, for we have no means with which to conduct private communications, and will have none until after our next annual convention, unless public spirited and sympathetic persons will make toward that end.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302493">In order to facilitate the work of the Federation it is necessary at this time that the chairman of our executive committee be immediately furnished with a copy of the constitution and number of members of every club in the Federation, and those desirous of entertaining; and we do earnestly invite all women to organize for practical work and join us without delay. We trust the presidents and others in authority in various local and state organizations will give this matter close and immediate attention. Our struggling race is in travail, and needs above all things the united, earnest and determined uplifting efforts of strong vigorous womanhood; this is pre-eminently the foundation  making age; the future moral and intellectual status of our race depends upon the real basic work, that the women of the race perform in this decade. Burdened with this conviction, we stretch out our hands to our sister women everywhere for help and courage and inspiration and light. Let us be up and doing. Time is passing and opportunities fleeting; let the heads of all clubs communicate at once with Mrs. Victoria Matthews, Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute, Tuskegee, Ala., and also raIly to the support of our official organ -- the WOMAN'S ERA. Remember we can establish it as a creditable race enterprise, or for lack of sympathy and support let it fail. We can make of it what we will, provided we first make it permanent. It not only never furnished a source or suspicion of income to the many writers composing its staff, from editor-in-chief, down, but has not paid its running expenses. It has established its name as a good wholesome, neatly printed, family newspaper. As the official organ of the Federation, it is not only our duty to support it, but to our interest as a body of women without other means of communication, and for the present without an exchequer. As soon as the heads of the various clubs, unions, etc., put themselves in communication with Matthews, important propositions concerning the future management and support of our official organ will be submitted. For this and other progressive lines of work vital to our organization we urge immediate attention.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302494">In order to facilitate organization, we have issued application blanks for the use of clubs desiring membership in the National Federation of Afro-American Women.

"lords of creation" were in attendance. The program proved interesting to all, but some gentlemen who believed that the club movement at Tuskegee savored too much of the "New Woman," showed signs of uneasiness when "motions," "points of order," etc., were in use by the members of the club during the time devoted to business matters.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302504">No one of them rose for a "point of order" on the "New Woman," but at the close of the evening's exercise one rose to give a motion for a vote of thanks for the invitation that had been extended, and in the regular form a rising vote of thanks was given by the entire party of thirty-five gentlemen.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302505">Club matters have proved of great interest this month.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302506">Mrs. Washington has been called to several places to organize clubs among women. She has given hopeful and interesting accounts of the earnest women who, though timid, are determined to do effective work on reaching the masses who are less fortunate.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302507">A plan is on foot and arrangements are being made by which the club may assume control of the county funds devoted heretofore to the mismanagement of the domestic affairs of the County Poor House. Frequent visits to the Poor House by members of the club, and the report of a committee that made a thorough investigation of affairs there, found an intensely serious condition of things that involved matters of life and death.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302508">The reports from the departments of the club argue well for the coming year. The Vesta Club, under the direction or Mrs. N.B. Young, gave an entertainment and devoted the proceeds to the needy poor. Two old women, who were helpless and bedridden, have been made comfortable.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302509">The members of the Ednah Cheney Club, under Mrs. Thornton, have three old ex-slaves in their charge. Helpless and alone in their cabins, they have been comforted, clothed and fed during the present storms of the wintry weather. The club is not only systematic in its charities but is also in its literary efforts to maintain the principles of their constitution.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302510">The Ministers' Wives Ciub, under Mrs. Estelle Penney, gives hopes for better and more earnest work by the members in the field of the church and homes to which they are allied.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302511">Miss Francis Willard has become intensely interested in the W.C.T.U. circle, under Miss Susie Porter. She has contributed all the current publications of the Temperance Union for the reading room, and has written words of encouragement as a sister to a sister of one sisterhood.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302512">The department of Current History, under Mrs. Warren Logan, still gives a report that shows there is no lack of interest in the questions of the day, though minutes are few and not easily spared from the duties of the moment, when one may cull the current literature.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302513">Just as many women as heretofore are interested in the work that Mrs. Booker Washington plans for her club or town and country women.

To the left is Morris Island, where the first shot of the Civil War was fired, and from which point shot and shell were leveled at our city and its fortifications with slight intermissions, for over 500 days .

Those for colored children are represented by the Shaw Memorial on Mary street, and the Simonton on Morris street. These are large and well appointed buildings, but are necessarily crowded on account of the dense population, there being about 1700 in the two. The former was erected by the colored people about 1868 or '69, in memory of Col. Robert G.

A good newspaper gives facts, and is not concerned, and surely is not to blame, if the facts encroach upon somebody's pet hobby or were furnished by someone who is personally distasteful to a subscriber. A paper which is afraid of everybody's feelings has no call to he published. If a paper be clean it is certainly privileged to be brave if it can, and a clean, brave paper serves a double purpose; it justifies itself and takes its readers out of that overcrowded territory which is filled with those who judge through personal feeling.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302547">The appeal of Mrs. Washington to the clubs of the country to circulate protests against the Separate Car System, refers to a matter of vital importance to every colored woman of the country. There is no one among us, no matter what her culture or refinement, but who may become the victim of this iniquitous custom, and the experience of Mrs. Thomas Fox, who was put off in the woods and at night, is an example of what may befall any one of us, or of our daughters, if called to the South. Mrs. Washington's movement is
one of practical moment,.and there is no other to which our women should lend their energies with more devotion and energy.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_10.14" type="Report"><head rend="center">TRAVELING AND WORKING FOR THE ERA.</head><p xml:id="era2_1302548">The women of the North long ago became convinced of the worth of Mrs. Matthews (Victoria Earle) as a woman of intelligence, enthusiasm, energy and talent. As all these attributes possessed by Mrs. Matthews have been employed and devoted almost exclusively in race work, it is not strange that her reputation and the esteem in which she is held has grown with the years.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302549">In the last few months Mrs. Matthews has been traveling in the South, first in the interest of the Atlanta Congress, and latterly in the interest of the ERA. In her travels she has worked with the same unflagging zeal and intensity which characterizes all she does, and with the same results. Her reception everywhere has been more than cordial. Not only has she interested the women, but she has won their sympathy and love. It is one of our crying needs that our women who are working for "the one end" all over the country, should be united in order to carry on their work with the zeal and ardor which only union can give. It is to this end that Mrs. Matthews is bending all her energies and it is to this end that the ERA works.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302550">In the future, Mrs. Matthews will be more intimately connected with the ERA, and its management can feel assured that this announcement will be read with pleasure by women everywhere.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_10.15" type="Report"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">BOSTON SENTIMENT ON THE ARNETT CASE</seg>. -- THE LAW WILL BE ENFORCED.</head><p xml:id="era2_1302551">Comments on the Arnett case are getting a trifle monotonous, and it would seem as if the whole gamut of opinion and comment had been made. And yet there is a last word to be said, and it is fitting that it should come from the seat of the trouble.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302552">Boston itself has spoken officially upon the matter, the city council unanimously and enthusiastically endorsed a set of resolutions introduced in a speech made by Mr. Stanley Ruffin, not only censuring the hotel-keepers, but calling upon the city attorney to press the law.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302554">The Arnett case is a peculiar one. There is hardly a hotel in Boston which does not entertain colored guests every month in the year. We have been informed that the Bishop himself has, on other occasions, put up at first-class hotels. All of us know of prominent colored people who have registered at leading houses time and time again; colored business men daily lunch and dine at Young's, Parkers, the Adams House, the Thorndike, the Quincy, and there is never a theatre

party but that freely and thoughtlessly walks into the most available hotel for an after-theatre supper. To all these, the refusal to accommodate the Bishop came as a surprise. The fact is, that if the Bishop had presented himself for accommodation he would scarcely have found one of these cowards bold enough to refuse him, but it was a chance for cowardly negro-haters to express themselves without danger, and it was embraced.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302555">The splendid expression from press and pulpit brought out by the incident almost repays the race which was insulted. Boston contains many people as prejudiced, as cowardly and bitter on the race question as can be found anywhere, but this incident has proven what the ruling sentiment is. Moreover, the colored people will continue to go just wherever they please, and feel assured that if a man is found bold enough to insult them he will never do it more than once.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_10.16" type="Report"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">WHY NOT STRENGTHEN THE FEDERATION</seg> BY COMING WITHIN ITS FOLD?</head><p xml:id="era2_1302556">The closing action of the Atlanta Congress in adjourning as a body to meet in Nashville is very perplexing., especially in view of the resolution passed concerning the Nashville Centennial. Our women bid fair to compete with the lords of creation in the matter of forming new organizations. We understand this is the only congress connected with the Cotton States Exposition that did not end with it. One pleasant feature of the Congress was the much commented upon, thorough unselfishness of the members of the National Federation. The workers in the Congress were largely made up from the ranks of the Federation. The National League was hardly in evidence. Their only representative was made, through Mrs. Lawson's courtesy, a member of the Congress, after her arrival in Atlanta.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_10.17" type="Report"><head rend="center">THE PRACTICAL SUPPORT OF THE OFFICIAL ORGAN.</head><p xml:id="era2_1302557">ANSWERS TO QUERIES SENT OUT BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE FEDERATION.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302558">Sometime ago Miss L.C. Carter, Recording Secretary of the National Federation, was requested to communicate certain important queries to the clubs comprising the Federation, among which was, "What Plan would you suggest for the practical support of our official organ, THE WOMAN'S ERA?"</p><p xml:id="era2_1302559">We submit a few of the returns:</p><p xml:id="era2_1302560">Mrs. B.T. Washington thought that each local club would appoint an agent, and order through her, monthly, as many copies  as the club had members. "It would serve not only to increase its circulation, but broaden the minds of indifferent women as to the proportions of our woman's movement."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302561">Mrs. Mary H. Dickerson of Newport, writes: "I think the best means of support for our official organ is a large subscription list, and the best way to secure it is to write to each League for subscribers, and ask that each League appoint an agent to solicit outside subscribers."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302562">Mrs. Libbie C. Anthony of Jefferson City, Mo.: "I think our National President should have a column in the ERA each month, in order to stimulate a desire on the part of the various clubs to see the account of the Federation work. I also think copies should be sent to prominent working women in the various states, requesting their support and that they show the paper to their friends."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302563">Mrs. R. Jerome Jeffrey of Rochester, N.Y.: "I thought it was decided in the convention that each club should take a certain number of papers. Surely each member of a club would be willing to do this much toward making our position secure as a self-respecting body."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302564">Mrs. Rebecca Aldridge of Pittsburgh, Pa.: "The paper  should be under the control and management of the National organization, and each club represented in the same pledge itself to take as many copies monthly as it has financial members."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302566">Miss Annie L. Blanchard of Salem,.Mass.: "I would suggest that each club he held for so many copies, or that they guarantee so many subscribers from their members, and one member be appointed to sell to outsiders. In the various clubs there are members who have not had the advantage s of an education and home influence. Some of these are married, while others are single. Would it not be advisable, in order to have the ERA reach and touch every member, to have a 'Home  Department,' and under this head have papers which will suggest to some of the members to pay more attention to the moral, physical and intellectual training of the young; for instance, Mrs. Matthews' paper on 'Kindergarten Schools' is a

It was due to the forgetfulness or negligence of one of the priests of St. Joseph's, Rev. W. O'Connell, who was duly notified, and also to the b1undering  of those Catholics whose duty it was to attend to the matter and see that it was done. In no instance are the sacraments withheld on account of Protestants being the owners or inmates of the houses in which a sick Catholic may reside. In only one case are they withhold, that is, when the house is one of ill-repute or the circumstances such as no Christian could remain in them without sin.</p><closer xml:id="era2_1302584"><salute>Very truly yours,</salute><signed><name>MARY A.

However, if there was no reason why the rites (which Mrs. Morris reverenced and loved well enough to leave the whole of her estate to help perpetuate) should not have been administered, then it was criminal negligence on somebody's part that it was not done.

Yet it is impossible visit any of the southern slates and to know something of southern life without being more or less stirred to speak of one's impressions. There is something in the land of the south and in its civilization that makes it the most interesting portion of our Country. There are in this sunny land so many social contrasts, so many contradictions, so much good cheer and so much sadness, so much hope and so much despair, and above all such warmth of welcome on the one hand and so many repelling, prejudices on the other, that you are scarcely sure of your beliefs after leaving the south and again settling down to the certainties of your own fireside. There is an unseen relation of things, a deeper meaning of cause and effect, that make many things seem to he what they are not. You feel a degree of hesitancy in holding to conclusion's based upon a mere roadside observation of things and people. Nothing is more easy than to injure the cause of justice to our southern friends by mere declamatory statements of ill considered conclusions of what appears to the senses.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302606">The existence of the Exposition made Atlanta a good place to start from to see the south and its people. The best of the south, both in things, people and behavior was here  on exhibition. Whatever the south was <hi rend="italic">capable</hi> of in the spirit of hope, good cheer and hospitality, every stranger within its gates was made to feel. Here it was possible to find, as no where else in the south, suggestions of the narrowing of the fundamental differences between whites and blacks. Here could be found the blending of hopes and fears, and patience and forgiveness that must some day result in better and juster standards of estimating the worth of people.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302607">It is scarcely possible to add anything of interest to what has already been so fully and well said by Mrs. Matthews, Miss Anna Jones and Mrs. Gray about the Atlanta Exposition.. I merely wish to add my testimony of appreciation as to the noble meaning and inestimable value of the Negro exhibit as a source of wholesome influence. Nothing since the enactment of the 15th amendment has awakened so much popular and kindly interest in the colored race as the contents of the Negro building at the Atlanta Exposition. Though but a partial exhibit of the Negro's progress in things material and spiritual, the exhibit was of a character to suggest a great deal that was not displayed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302608">The Woman's Congress was an inspiring object lesson of our women's capacity for harmonious action. Linked with the Boston Conference of last August, the Woman's Congress in Atlanta can scarcely be less than a historical landmark in the development of the fraternal spirit among the colored women of America. There was displayed at the Atlanta Congress a variety of talents and fibre of character and capacity for achievements that were a surprise and inspiration both to the women themselves, and to the thousands, who came to see and listen to a new voice in the affairs of race development.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302609">But where do all these alert, accomplished and sufficient women come from? This question was happily answered for your correspondent in visiting several towns in Alabama. A hurried visit Tuskegee, Montgomery, Selma, Marion, Greensboro and Birmingham of that state gave a new sense of pride and confidence in our women. At each place you will be welcomed by women who have been touched and strengthened for noble activities by the better spiritual and social forces of our day. In each place will be found a nucleus of womanly experience - women who are wide awake to the opportunities and responsibilities of the hour and eager for a larger co-operation of hand and heart in the work of regeneration. If Mrs. Washington of Tuskegee, Mrs. Davenport of Montgomery, Mrs. M.A. Dillard at Selma, Mrs. S.A. Childs at Marion, Mrs. S.A. Christian of Greensboro, Mrs. Ross of Birmingham and their associates are a type of our southern sisters, then those of us living north of the Ohio will need to bestir ourselves to keep pace with their advancing influence for good.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302611">It was delightful to note that in this land of the south women of real accomplishments and large sympathies enjoy a more decided influence than
<pb xml:id="era2_1302610" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
one would expect, and are valued by all classes at their real value. A happy illustration of this fact is to be found in the career of Miss M.W. Dillard of Birmingham. Miss Dillard is an alumnae of Provident Hospital and Training School of Chicago. She has exceptional qualifications and graces for her profession. Going to Birmingham with her scientific training she soon won the confidence of the entire medical fraternity. She is not only recognized as the head of her profession in this southern city, but prejudice yields wherever she goes. Wherever she is associated with white nurses in any important case Miss Dillard is always senior in management and responsibility. The respect and deference paid to this successful young woman by the best white people of Birmingham ought to be a helpful example to many of our discouraged young women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302612">Mr. Booker T. Washington spent a week in Chicago last month. That is scarcely a newsy statement, yet to Chicago
people it was an event outranking in popular interest the coming of any other visitor during the season. The clubs representing the culture and wealth of the city open wide the door of welcome to this new man of power and goodness and eagerly declare that they are honored by his presence. All the newspapers print his every utterance and men and women high and low flock to shake hands and give assurances of their respect and esteem. The cause of the American Negro becomes a theme of serious and respectful consideration in every community where Booker T. Washington is present speaks.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302613">"I will not permit any man to drag me down by making me hate him," is the subtle way Mr. Washington has of making the enemies of the colored race ridiculous and defenseless in their meanness.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302614">Mr. Washington addressed the I.B.W.

Peace and quiet were restored to Northern homes. But what of our brother? He has his freedom and that is all. Willing hearts and hands came to his aid, and schools were soon established by the government.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302756">In a home in New York a young girl was sitting one day, looking very thoughtful.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302757">"Mother," she said, "I believe I'll go south and teach in a Freedman's school."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302758">"Very well, my child; if you feel called to that work, go," her mother replied.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302759">Ellen was only eighteen, but her clear brown eyes showed that her purpose was a fixed one. Her mother looked up, as she spoke, and noted that the color in her daughter's cheeks had deepened into a crimson. Then she felt and knew that the call had been given.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302760">"God's ways are mysterious, and past finding out," she thought, but said nothing.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302762">Ellen Dungee was one of a large family of children. Her parents were religious, and the
<pb xml:id="era2_1302761" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
father, a minister, and a good, pious man, who "loved his neighbor as himself," gave his consent to her mission. Preparations were made for her starting. Their friend, Frederick Douglass, readily gave a recommendation to the brave young girl.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302763">As money was needed for the long journey, Ellen, who possessed a musical soprano voice, in connection with other friends gave concerts throughout the state, also in New Jersey. But a strange fact always presented itself to her mind, that, although the Music Hall would usually be filled, or the church in which the concert was given be crowded, the receipts would never amount to more than three or four dollars over the expenses. Alas! who can tell? Certainly, Uncle Josh and Uncle Jerry never did tell; and if not they, who could, for were they not the doorkeepers?</p><p xml:id="era2_1302764">Ellen visited her aunt in New Jersey a few weeks. Her uncle, a man well to do and owning considerable property, was one of the close fisted kind. We have all met him.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302765">"Well, niece, I hear you are going south to teach the Freedmen," he said, at parting. Ellen's heart beat faster in anticipation, and the color rose to her cheeks. "Here is it present for you.; it will help you along a bit." And he handed her two rustling paper dollars. Ellen's countenance fell, but she thanked him. She had enough money for her traveling expenses, so she said her prayers with a light heart that night.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302766">And now she must say goodbye to her home, her kindred, and all that were most dear, and turn her face toward a strange land, as it were. But her heart was brave, and her trust in God was strong.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302767">From New Jersey she went to Cincinnati and took the boat to Louisville. Here it was that Ellen first feel the difference between the north and the south. Living far away, the war seemed like a dream, but here was it stern reality. She stopped at the teachers' home, which was guarded by soldiers.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302768">"How shall I reach my school?" Ellen inquired of Colonel Caxton, the next day.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302769">"I will escort you there, my young lady," the Colonel replied, as it is too far for you to go alone."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302770">The next day how the rain did pour! But the Colonel and Ellen started in spite of the rain. A few miles on the railroad, and they stopped at a little country town.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302771">The tavern was the principal lounging place for the villagers and all who came to hear the news. Dogs and children seemed to have the right of way.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302772">The Colonel returned to the city and Ellen was left alone. No one spoke to her; no one offered her food. A, colored man and his wife were working around the kitchen. They dared not. There she sat, hungry, tired and heartsick, all that dreary day. And the rain poured down.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302773">"Oh, for one word of human sympathy! If some one would only speak to me!" thought the poor girl. But the steady drip, drip of the rain was the only response.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302774">That evening the school was to be organized, and someone was sent for Ellen. The little church, where they were going, was a long distance out on the pike. Still it rained, and all was mud. That muddy, clayey road! Will she ever forget it?</p><p xml:id="era2_1302775">Arriving at the church she was treated with great respect by the people who had gathered there. The organization went on quietly, when suddenly from the outside a stone was hurled through the window, then another, and another, 
until most of the window panes were broken. Then shots were fired in-quick succession.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302776">Ellen looked at the stalwart men, whose faces were blanched with fear, but not one of them stirred. Her blood boiled with indignation. She could not understand it then. She did ere long. Who will take the teacher to board?</p><p xml:id="era2_1302777">The question was put, but no one answered. At last a brave little woman spoke up and said, "I will. She is welcome to come and stay at my house." So that night poor, tired Ellen rested comfortably in Aunt Ann's soft featherbed.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302778">The plain little schoolhouse was soon filled with the bright earnest faces of children. And what a hive of industry it soon became! Ellen soon learned to love her work and gained the hearts of all the people. But her life was not all sunshine -- ah, no!</p><p xml:id="era2_1302779">"Tell Uncle Mose to be on his guard tonight. The Ku Klux are around," a neighbor would whisper, one day. "They are after the teacher. They say she must go."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302780">That night there was not much sleep at Aunt Ann's humble cottage. Before the fire were sitting Uncle Mose and three or four men who had offered their assistance in case of trouble. There they sat dozing, with their guns ready at a moment's warning.</p><pb xml:id="era2_1302781" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era2_1302782">Will they fight? Yes, to the death. For is not all that they hold most dear under this roof and their protection? The women and children were gathered in a back room.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302783">Suddenly Uncle Moses awoke. He listened intently, his face turned to an ashen hue.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302784">"Tom," he whispered to a young man next to him, a very Hercules of strength, "they're coming."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302785">Tom sat up. Faintly in the distance could be heard the sound of horses' hoofs rapidly approaching. Tom set his teeth. No coward was he. Hastily awakening the others, he prepared for the coming danger. He smiled as the sounds drew nearer. Afraid? No! Did a Spartan ever know fear? Did Leonidas at the pass of Thermopylae know fear?</p><p xml:id="era2_1302786">As they felt the nearness of the enemy, they all with one accord aimed at the door. Suddenly a volley of shots was fired, which was returned with equal velocity. Then there was a silence.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302787">"Are they gone, Tom?" whispered Uncle Mose.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302788">"I am going to see," said Tom, as he smiled grimly to himself.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302789">He went outside, and returned with something in his hand.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302790">"What is it, Tom? " and Uncle Moses' voice shook.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302791">"A note of warning, signed 'K. K. K.' We all know what that means, sighed Tom. "She will have to go."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302792">The next morning they gave Ellen the warning, and there were tears in Uncle Moses' eyes as he handed it to her. But Tom gritted his teeth. Ellen read the note, and as they all watched her breathlessly, she said, "They say if I do not leave in twenty-four hours they will burn the schoolhouse over my head."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302793">"Child, you must go," said Aunt Ann.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302794">Ellen sat silently, and after a few thoughtful moments, she said in her quiet manner, and with a look of resolve upon her face, "Uncle Mose and Aunt Ann, as long as you will give me shelter, I will stay."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302795">Tom's face beamed. He loved courage, and he quietly applauded the little school teacher.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302796">"Honey," said Uncle Mose, with streaming eyes, "as long as we have a roof over our heads, you shall share it with us." And he and Aunt Ann joined hands and bowed their heads in prayer.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302797">It was a beautiful Saturday morning. The sun shone bright and the air was fresh and balmy.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302798">"Aunt Ann," said Ellen, "I believe I'll go over to Eliza and the children, as I have promised her so often to make her a visit, and today is so pleasant."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302799">"Child, don't go today," said Aunt Ann. "I have had a warning."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302800">"Nonsense, Aunt Ann!" Your warnings are just bad dreams, that's all."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302801">But Aunt Ann shook her head sadly. Ellen felt her spirits rise, in spite of the night before, so she went along quietly, listening to herself. Her path lay through a dense growth of trees and underbrush. About half way through the woods and she stopped. The air was still; not a sound could be heard; not even a leaf stirred. She listened. A feeling of deep fear came over her, as she remembered that not long since a man had been found not far from this very spot, shot through the heart. He had been warned by the Ku Klux. This feeling was not to be shaken off, and she slowly retraced her steps.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302802">Was it Aunt Ann's warning? Did Aunt Ann possess that same power that caused "Old Allan-Bane" to foretell the coming of the Knight of Snowdoun, James Fitz-James?</p><p xml:id="era2_1302803">On Sunday Ellen met all her pupils in the Sabbath School. They were all there, over fifty of them, from the little tot on up to those who were entering manhood and womanhood. How their songs did ring out! And with what zeal they studied their Bible lesson! Today we are trying to teach the necessity of the virtues of honesty, thrift and economy. What book teaches these better than the Bible? Look at the honest, rugged character of the Scoth, and what people know their Bibles better?</p><p xml:id="era2_1302804">Monday morning, Ellen started for school as usual. It was about two miles away, and as most of the children came from five to six miles from their homes, she met them on the way. They walked on talking pleasantly of home affairs, but as they were turning a road that led to the schoolhouse they saw a dense smoke ascending.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302805">Ellen's heart failed her. A boy came running to her.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302806">"Oh, Miss Ellen," he said, "our schoolhouse is all burned!"</p><p xml:id="era2_1302807">When Ellen reached the spot she found the children standing round crying, and the schoolhouse was in ashes. Ellen tried to comfort them, but her heart was too heavy, so she wept with them. She sent a dispatch to Colonel Caxton the same day, but it was intercepted.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302809">She now felt that the time had come for her to
<pb xml:id="era2_1302808" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
go. And how they all did gather around her at the parting! Strong men wept, and the children clang to her. It was more sad than a funeral. Uncle Moses and Aunt Ann gave her their blessing, and as the train steamed up, she tore herself away. The children waved their hands until the train was lost to their view.</p></div><div xml:id="era2_12.02" type="Report"><head rend="center">TUSKEGEE WOMAN'S CLUB.</head><docAuthor>Elizabeth E.

With the coming election of new officers for another year will come, no doubt, new plans and ways and means for renewed effort in the immediate work of the club as well as its auxiliaries.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302811">During the year, in devising plans by which the club might reach the people of the town of Tuskegee to lift them to a higher moral atmosphere in church life, a plan was hit upon whereby members of the club became interested and three ladies, Mrs. Sara Peake Greene, Miss Mary Melvin and Mrs. Estelle Penny, have accomplished much. The work of the latter in her club of Ministers' Wives has been reported during the year. The work of the former has been miscellaneous, but will be reported with the year's report of the club work.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302812">The departments of the club are not growing aweary in well doing. The monthly reports of the Vesta Club, Current History, Ministers' Wives, W.C.T.U., Women's Conference, Band of Mercy, social purity clubs, Dorcas Society and the Ednah Cheney are cheering. One of the charges of the Ednah Cheney was laid to rest by them on the 14th. The tried old Christian, who had been cradled in slavery, beaten and crippled by her cruel taskmasters, and deserted in her aged helplessness by her relatives, has been tenderly cared for by the members of the Ednah Cheney for a year.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302813">"The Negro in Business" was the subject for discussion on the evening of March 20. Miss Sara Hunt read a paper that gave in a witty way a clear description of the average Afro-American in business. Quite an interesting discussion was provoked and the general opinion expressed was that the average business man needs more promptness and attention in his dealings with others, while those of his own race, who are liberal in giving their patronage, should not expect more indulgence in matters of weight, length and time than they would from their business brothers in white.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302814">"The Negro in Politics" was the subject of a paper by Miss M. Childs, who opened the discussion on the evening of April 3. The writer agreed with others of the club that the future of the Afro-American in politics should depend upon his thoughtful consideration of a platform -- Free Coinage, Bimetalism, or what not, and not on the old question of obligation for certain liberty that was merely one of the results of the late unpleasantness.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302815">The president made a vigorous appeal for our club organ, the ERA.

Mr. Hawley was for many years an honored member of this church. The services, conducted by Rev.

The church was filled with citizen friends and members of the Bosworth Post G.A.R., of which the deceased was an old member.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302817">The hymns sung were "Onward, Christian Soldiers" and "Soldiers of Christ, Arise."</p><p xml:id="era2_1302818">Mrs. A.C.

His was the burial of a soldier and a Christian.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302819">"And this is the lesson of it all to me.

His boldness and willingness to be sacrificed for the deliverance of the oppressed is marvelous, and historic facts prove conclusively that the Harper's Ferry insurrection was the prologue to the national tragedy which resulted in
<pb xml:id="era2_1302856" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the ensanguined washing away of that hideous blot, human slavery, from our country's otherwise fair escutcheon.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302858">Mark well the continued train of events.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302859">John Brown's insurrection and his ignominious death occurred in 1859; in 1860 the Republican party was born and Abraham Lincoln was elected president of the United States; he was inaugurated in 1861; secession followed, and the establishment of a Southern Confederacy, with slavery as its chief cornerstone, was attempted; in September, 1862, President Lincoln issued his Emancipation Proclamation, which took effect in January, 1863; in 1864 the colored troops fought nobly, and in 1865 "Old Glory" floated over our reunited country.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302860">Thirty-five years have elapsed since the curtain was rung up for the prologue in which the martyred hero, John Brown, like Arnold Winklereid, "made way for liberty," and twenty-nine years have passed since the curtain fell on the last act of the tragedy, and yet the people of this country, which may now hold up its head among the nations and boast of being "The Land of the Free," have not honored the hero of the prologue with a "curtain call." Even the 8,000,000 of Afro-Americans, for whom John Brown gave up his life and also the lives of four of his sons, have not, hitherto, conceived the grand and glorious idea of erecting a monument to mark the grave where this martyred hero lies buried. Not unwept, not unhonored, not unsung, but still in a neglected and sunken grave at North Elba, N.Y.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302861">The John Brown Monument Association, which was organized and incorporated under the laws of the State of Minnesota, August 17, 1894, for the purpose of erecting a marble shaft over his neglected grave, have changed their plans, for after I visited the Women's National Congress at Atlanta, Ga., and spoke on the subject, "Should Afro-Americans honor John Brown?" that intelligent body, after considering the needs and conditions of our race in the Southland, decided to help this association to honor him by the erection of an orphan's home in his memory somewhere in the Southland, and efforts are being made now to raise funds for this purpose. If the movement is successful, whatever credit is due must be bestowed proportionately upon all Afro-American citizens, and we feel assured that there is not an Afro-American in this country who would not help to honor our dear old hero, John Brown, by giving something for this worthy cause; for, after his arrest, imprisonment and conviction, yet on the march to the scaffold, he paid the last benediction to our race when he stopped to kiss the Negro child. And my prayer is that the hearts of every Afro-American of this country may be united to show their gratitude to this martyr by helping to erect an orphan's home to the memory of John Brown, the grandest warrior that ever buckled on a sword, and the greatest hero of the nineteenth century.</p><signed><name>Mrs. T.H.

After assuring myself that the information was correct, I made all haste to make up for lost time by accepting the natural logic of such maneuvering. Washington was chosen as the place for the First Annual Convention of the National Federation of Afro-American Women on account of the "cut rates" that city for the month of July. A committee was appointed to secure a place of meeting and make proper arrangements for the comfort of delegates. As the "cut rates" extend over the entire month of July, providing the tickets are deposited with the company's agent on or before July 14, and for other reasonable considerations, the date was fixed for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, July 20, 21, 22, the meeting to take place at the 19th Street Baptist Church.

It will be remembered this association was incorporated as the John Brown Monument Association of St. Paul, Minn. Its president, Mrs. T.H. Lyles, after conferring with other leading women, accepted the proposition made at Atlanta that such an institution as above mentioned was more needed than a marble shaft or other sculptured memorial. It was decided to invite the women of the entire country to become interested; further, that the memorial farm should go to that section which succeeded in raising the most money. Acting upon this the magnanimous women of St. Paul, under the leadership of their noble, great-hearted president, consented to a revocation of the original charter and the securing of a new one which should cover the above object; and the fund hitherto raised will or rather has been deposited with the proper authorities for the founding and maintaining of a home farm for refractory children, said institution to be a memorial to John Brown.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302877">In union there is strength, so we cordially invite all women to attend the coming convention on the date given above.

Without the aid of any financial appropriation, through long and expensive trips, unceasing correspondence, much thought and much talk, Mrs. Matthews has made and developed plans, aroused and sustained enthusiasm, and now as the time of the annual convention approaches, places the Federation, its aims, its scope, before the world in the dignified, earnest attitude, which is impressive and convincing.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302902">The Federation in its first year has grown rapidly in number and strong in enthusiasm. At the dissolution of the first convention there was little -- in fact, nothing of a material nature to bind the forces together. The organization itself was not even complete, and but for the devotion and earnestness of the president, Mrs. Washington, and that of Mrs. Matthews, the Federation would hardly have found itself where it is today.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302903" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era2_1302904">The cordial invitation of the Ada Sweet Club of Minneapolis, published elsewhere, to the convention to meet in that city, was received with much gratification.

The Ada Sweet Club is of recent fruition, but full of life and enthusiasm.

It is expected that Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. F.B. Williams and Mrs. R.H. Terrell will be in the city at that time. Mrs. Matthews comes from New York for a talk with the New England presidents of clubs in the National Federation, over the program of work for the annual meeting. Mrs. Williams comes to lecture and be present as speaker at one or more of the meetings of that week. If Mrs. Terrell is present she will also be heard from some of the platforms. Much interest is expressed to hear both of these ladies by members of the Massachusetts State Federation. One is <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Mrs. Williams of the Chicago Woman's Club, while Mrs. Terrell, beside being one of the only two women ever honored with an appointment as public school supervisor in Washington, is said to be an eloquent platform speaker.

the turmoil, to hold its regular April meeting.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302934">There were many things brought before the house. The committee having in charge the affair of the ward in the Charity Hospital reported the result of their interviews with Dr. Lewis and Mother Agnes. It was found that under no circumstances whatever would colored doctors be permitted to practise in the hospital, but the women of club were urged, as they loved and respected the unfortunates of their race and sex, to hasten in their work of endowing the special ward. Each member of the club pledged herself to raise a certain amount by a fixed date, and it is hoped to complete the arrangements by June.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302935">Dr. L.A.

It is still more significant to notice how much the public opinion of the colored women has had to do with turning the tide of political opinion this way or that; so much so that one of the subterfuges adopted by an unpopular faction to catch the Afro-American vote was the opening of a new public school in the rear of the Third Ward.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302937">The W.A.C.

musical prodigy, Eddie Moore, whom the New Orleans people had sent to Germany to study, that almost everyone must feel an interest in his welfare. It was a great undertaking for a committee of women and men to take in charge, with no capital or backing save abundant energy and a cheerful determination to accomplish what they had set out to do. There has been no rest for four years, and it seemed that the fruition of their labors was at hand. Eddie had been sent to Stuttgart, his passage paid, his piano purchased, and twice a year the tuition and other incidentals paid. He completed the regular course last summer, and as his health was poor was begged to return. But he pleaded for another year, in order to acquire a repertoire that his friends might be justly proud of his playing. The graduation was to have been in June, and July would have seen Eddie in New Orleans, when a short while ago a letter from the American Consul to Professor Nickerson announced the child's death. It was a cruel blow to his mother, his friends, and to the entire community who had builded such bright hopes upon this young musician who was to be forever an example of New Orleans grit and benevolence. It seems an irreparable loss; a loss in which all members of the race must feel a part. It brings tears to the eyes to think of the slender little follow, whose hands were small and waxen as a girls, asleep beneath the cold German skies, thousands f miles from home, old friends and his mother. But it was God's will.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302942">The Teachers' League has in rehearsal a drama, "Doomed for Life," to be presented at Globe Hall on the 15th of May.

We may now rejoice in the fact that the great pictures are not, as they once were, walled in from the gaze of the common people, but can be seen in copies and obtained at prices lower than we often pay for the most ordinary things in use. In fact, art seems as eager to come to us as we are to be influenced by its ministerings. Beside, the great artists of today gladly loan their choicest productions to gratify the taste of every art-loving community.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302949">What does this growing prevalence of art influence mean to our home life? I think it is not too much to say that art inspires every sanctity of feeling that lifts women from drudgery to loveliness; that makes men more chivalrous, and children more beautiful. Among the Greeks from whom we inherit everything that is perfect and of good taste in art, there was in every home a household god that watched over the destinies of the family. We might, with profit, borrow from this religious sense of the Greeks, the suggestion that art, in the form of sculpture, painting, etching, or engraving, may furnish each household amongst us some hero or heroine or sentiment that shall be to us the saving influence of home blessedness.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302950">How much the pictured face of that divinest of all madonnas, the Cistine, on our walls, would minister to the reign of love in every home! If mothers would teach their children to he gentle and humane, more effectively than by words, place on the wall for their inspection the kindly face of Rosa Bonheur, with her caressing arm about the neck of a domestic animal. And if they would inspire their daughters to be womanly and strong in all the virtues of perfect womanhood, place before them the faces of women who have done so much to glorify womankind. Let art also give to the boy's the inspiration and companionship of such heroes as John Brown, Phillips, Lincoln, Douglass, Edson and Watts.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302952">What portraits do for some, all forms of the beautiful in art may do for all of us. Many of us
<pb xml:id="era2_1302951" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
are never touched with the mystic beauty of a flower until art interprets it for us. It is said that the German poet, Schiller, never saw the ocean, and yet he described it with such power and accuracy that old seamen saw more in Schiller's verse than they had ever thought of in the overwhelming presence of the ocean itself.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302953">Scientists tell us that there are melodies in the earth sweeter than the human ever has yet heard; that there are exquisite tints of color too delicate for discernment by the ordinary eye; and that there is a fragrance of the rose never yet extracted by the human sense of smell. Only the tiniest insects of God's great kingdom of life realize these hidden beauties of the universe. Thus it is the mission of the artist, with his finer sense, to reveal to us what we would fail to recognize with our ordinary senses.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302954"> *  *  *  *  *  *</p><p xml:id="era2_1302955">The announcement by the chairman, Mrs. Matthews, of the Executive Committee of National Federation of Afro-American Women, in the last issue of the ERA, is a statement of extraordinary interest to the colored women of the country. Well may the chairman call the work before her "grave and serious." The thought of a Federation that shall embrace the best intelligence amongst the colored women of the country is an inspiring one and should bring to the amiable chairman a hearty co-operation. The bringing about of such a union is a work requiring infinite labor, patience, tact and good will. These federated interests are results of growth and development. It is only through the process of education and the force of example that these widely separated organizations are brought to see the power of union and feel the sweet spirit of helpful affiliation.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302956">It was a distinct gain in the progressive life of American colored women when the first suggestion came at a gathering in Washington of our women from all parts of the country that the essential interests of one club were the identical interests of all clubs. It gave us our first bracing touch of self confidence and our first inspiration to the larger duties and responsibilities of American womanhood. From the time of this first note of sisterly interest of colored women in each other, the sentiment has grown to a point where it has become a "grave and serious work" as to how we may have one instead of several National organizations.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302957">There is no concealing the fact that there was a wide spread feeling of dissatisfaction and disappointment that the National Federation of Afro-American women organized in Boston did not achieve the wished for unity. This feeling was accentuated by the further failure of the Atlanta Congress in a similar purpose. The Boston and Atlanta conferences were remarkable in the number of capable women assembled. Nothing properly within the purposes of those gatherings seemed to be too large or too difficult to be grasped by these newly found women. The names of Mrs. Cook, Mrs. Cooper, Mrs. Booker T. Washington, Mrs. Ruffin, Mrs. Matthews and their associates have been and still are a guarantee that the interests of our women will be conscientiously and capably guarded and guided toward unity and high purposes.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302958">The moral effect of the union of the National Colored Woman's League, the National Federation of Afro-American Women and the Atlanta Congress could not well be measured. Nothing would so thrill our women everywhere with the wholesome sense of importance and responsibility, and nothing could so quicken into practical helpfulness the sympathies of all women for each other as a well organized federation of the best intelligence and worth of our women.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302959">With such women as leaders and with such high purposes for inspiration it ought to be possible to find a basis of union. Fortunately for us, the personal ambitions that have been so fatal to all the large efforts of our men are not dangers to be feared in our efforts toward unity. There seems to have been a most happy freedom from the petty jealousies and envies that inevitably wreck social organizations. To those of us on the outside, there seems to he nothing substantial, nothing reasonable and nothing conscionable that can stand between the necessity for union and its joyous consummation. The opportunity is at hand for admittedly capable women to organize one of the most interesting and important parliaments of women ever attempted for the social amelioration of womankind in this country.</p><p xml:id="era2_1302960">Let us beware lest the strife for triumph obscure the larger claims of universal truth and righteousness.</p></div></div><div xml:id="era2_12.18" type="Filler"><head rend="center">THE FREDERICK DOUGLASS SOUVENIR.</head><p xml:id="era2_1302962">We take pleasure in bringing to the attention of our readers and the many friends and admirers of the late Frederick Douglass, the recent publi-
