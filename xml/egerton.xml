is, the only Reason that incites me to one, VIZ. the Smalness of them;
being willing to let my reader know why this is so: For as one great
commendation of our Sex, is, to know much, and speak little, so my Virgin
Modesty hath put a Period to the intended Length of the ensuing Lines, lest
censuring Criticks should measure my tongue by my Pen, and condemn me for a
Talkative, by the length of my Poem. Tho' O confess the illustrious Subject
requires (nay commands) an enlargement from any other Pen than mione (or
those under the same Circumastances) but I think it is good Frugality for
young Beginners to send forth a small Venture at first, and see how that
passes the merciless Ocean of Criticks, and what Returns it makes, and so
accordingly adventure the next time. I might enlarge this Preface with the
common Excuse of Writers for the Publication of their Books, VIZ. the
Impotunities of her obliging Friends: But what it was put me upon the
Publication of this, I am not bound to give the Reader an Account of; but I
think the Debauchery which I now answer, is a sufficient warrant for this
appearing of mine; in which he doth not only exclaim against Virtue, but
Moral Honesty too, and would (were it alone sufficient) banish all Goodness
out of them; but that will be an impossible thing, so long as we (the most
essentially good) do subsist: for 'tis observed in all Religions, that
Women are the truest Devotionists, and the most pious, and more heavenly
than those who pretend to be the most perfect and rational creatures; for
many Menwith the Conceit of their own Perfections, neglect that which
should make them so; as some mistaken persons, who think if they are of the
right Church they shall be infallibly saved, when they never follow the
Rules which lead to Salvation; and when Persons with this inscription pass
currant in Heaven, then it will be according to my Antagonist's Fancy, that
all Men are good, and fitting for Heaven because they are Men; and Women
irreversibly damn'd, because they are Women: But that Jeaven should make a
Male and Female, both of the same Species, and both indued with the like
Rational Souls, for two such differing Ends, is the most notorious
Principle, and the most unlikely of any that I shall never take it for an
Article of my Faith, being assured that Heaven is for all those whose
Purity and Obedience to its Law, qualifies them for it, whether Male or
Female; to which Place the latter seem to have the Claim, is the Opinion of
one of its Votaires, S. F.</p></div></div><div xml:id="egerton_003" type="Poem"><head><seg type="short-title">The Female Advocate</seg>, or An Answer to a late Satyr against the Pride, Lust

Birds, Trees hung with Fruit,</l><l>That might with man's Celestial Nature suit:</l><l>The world being made thus spacious and compleat,</l><l>Then Man was form'd, who seemed nobly great.</l><l>When Heaven survey'd the Works that it had done,</l><l>Saw Male and female, but found Man alone,</l><l>A barren Sex and insignificant;</l><l>So Heaven made Woman to supply the want,</l><l>And to make perfect what before was scant:</l><l>Then surely she a Noble Creature is,</l><l>Whom Heaven thus made to consummate all Bliss.</l><l>Though Man had been first, yet methinks She</l><l>In Nature should have the supremacy;</l><l>For Man was form'd out of dull senceless Earth;</l><l>But Woman she had a far nobler Birth:</l><l>For when the dust was purify'd by Heaven,</l><l>Made into Man, and Life unto it given,</l><l>Then the Almighty and All-wise God said,</l><l>That Woman of that Species should be made:</l><l>Which was no sooner said, but it was done,</l><l>'Cause 'twas not fit for Man to be alone.</l><l>Thus have I prov'd Womans Creation good,</l><l>And not inferior, when right understood:</l><l>To that of Man's; for both one Maker had,</l><l>Which made all good; then how could Eve be bad?</l><l>But then you'l say, though she at first was pure,</l><l>Yet in that State she did not long endure.</l><l>'Tis true; but if her Fall's examin'd right,</l><l>We find most Men have banish'd Truth for spight:</l><l>Nor is she quite so guilty as some make;</l><l>For Adam did most of the Guilt partake:</l><l>For he from God's own Mouth had the Command;</l><l>But Woman she had it at second hand:</l><l>The Devil's Strength weak Women might deceive,</l><l>But Adam tempted only was by eve.</l><l>Eve had the srongest Tempter, and least Charge;</l><l>Man's knowing most, doth his Sin make most large.</l><l>But though Woman Man to Sin did lead?</l><l>Yet since her Seed hath bruis'd the serpent's Head:</l><l>Why should she be made a publick scorn,</l><l>Of whom the great Almighty God was born?</l><l>Surely to speak one slighting Word, must be</l><l>A kind of murmuring Impiety:</l><l>But still their greatest haters do prove such</l><l>Who formerly have loved them too much:</l><l>And from the proverb they are not exempt;</l><l>Too much Familiarity has bred contempt;</l><l>For they associate themselves with none,</l><l>But such whose Virtues like their own, are gone;</l><l>And with all those, and only those who be</l><l>Most boldly vers'd in their debauchery:</l><l>And as in Adam all Mankind did die,</l><l>They make all base for ones Immodesty;</l><l>Nay, make the name a kind of Magick Spell,</l><l>As if 'twould censure married Men to Hell.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>Woman, ye Powers! the very Name's a Charm,</l><l>And will my Verseagainst all Criticks arm.</l><l>The Muses or Apollo doth inspire</l><l>Heroick Poets; but your's is a Fire,</l><l>Pluto from Hell did fend by Incubus,</l><l>Because we make their Hell less populous;</l><l>Or else you ne'er had damn'd the females thus:</l><l>But if so universally they are</l><l>Dispos'd to Mischief, what need you declare</l><l>Peculiar Faults, when all the World might see</l><l>With each approaching Morn a Prodigy:</l><l>Man curse dead Woman; I could hear as well</l><l>The black infernal Devils curse their Hell:</l><l>When there had been no such place we know,</l><l>If they themselves had not first made it so.</l><l>In Lust perhaps you others have excell'd,</l><l>And made all Whores that possibly would yield;</l><l>And courted all the Females in your way,</l><l>Then did design at last to make a Prey</l><l>Of some pure Virgins; or what's almost worse,</l><l>Make some chaste Wives to merit a Divorce.</l><l>But 'cause they hated your insatiate Mind,</l><l>Therefore you call what's Virtuous Unkind:</l><l>And Disappointments did your Soul perplex;</l><l>So in meer spight you curse the female Sex.</l><l>I would not judge you thus, only I find</l><l>You would adulterate all Womankind,</l><l>Not only with your Pen; you higher soar;</l><l>You'd exclude marriage, make the World a Whore.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>But if all Men should of your humor be</l><l>And should rob Hymen of his Deity,</l><l>They soon would find the Inconveniency.</l><l>Then hostile Spirits would be forc'd to Peace,</l><l>Because the World so slowly would increase.</l><l>They would be glad to keep their Men at home,</l><l>And each want more to attend his Throne;</l><l>Nay, should an English Prince resolve that he</l><l>would keep the number of of's Nobility:</l><l>And this dull custom some few years maintin'd,</l><l>There would be none less than a Peer oth' land.</l><l>And I do fancy 'twould be pretty sport</l><l>To see a Kingdom cramb'd into a Court.</l><l>Sure a strange world, when one should nothing see,</l><l>unless a Baudy House or Nunnery.</l><l>Or should this Act ere pass, woman would fly</l><l>With unthought swiftness, to each Monastry</l><l>And in dark Caves secure her Chastity.</l><l>She only in a Marriage-Bed delights;</l><l>The very Name of Whore her Soul affrights.</l><l>And when that sacred Ceremony's gone,</l><l>Woman I am sure will chuse to live alone.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>There's none can number all those vertuous Dames</l><l>Which chose cold death before their lovers flames.</l><l>The chast Lucretia whom proud Tarquin lov'd,</l><l>Her he slew, her chastity she prov'd.</l><l>But I've gone further than I need have done,</l><l>Since we have got examples nearer home.</l><l>Witness those Saxon Ladies who did fear</l><l>The loss of Honour when the Danes were here:</l><l>And cut their Lips and Noses that they might</l><l>Not pleasing seem, or give the Danes delight.</l><l>Thus having done what they could justly do,</l><l>At last they fell their sacrifices too.</l><l>Thus when curst Osbright courted Beon's wife,</l><l>She him refus'd with hazard of her life.</l><l>And some which I do know but will not name,</l><l>Have thus refus'd and hazarded the same.</l><l>I could say more, but History will tell</l><l>Many more things that do these excel.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>In Constancy they men excell as far</l><l>A heavens bright lamp doth a dull twinckling star.</l><l>Tho' man is alwaies altering of his mind,</l><l>Inconstancy is only in womankind.</l><l>'Tis something strange, no hold, it isn't because</l><l>The men have had the power of making Laws;</l><l>For where is there that man that ever dy'd,</l><l>Or ere expired with his loving Bride.</l><l>But numerous trains of chast wives expire</l><l>With their dear Husbands, tho in flames of fire:</l><l>We'd do the same if custom did require.</l><l>But this is done by indian women, who</l><l>Do make their Constancy immortal too,</l><l>As is their Fame: We find India yields</l><l>More glorious Phoenix than the Arabian fields.</l><l>The German women Constancy did shew</l><l>When Wensberg was besieged, beg'd they might go</l><l>Out of the City, with no bigger Packs</l><l>Than each of them could carry on their Backs.</l><l>The wond'ring world expected they'd have gone</l><l>Laded with treasures from their native home,</l><l>But crossing expectation each did take</l><l>Her Husband as her burden on her back.</l><l>So saved him from intended death, and she</l><l>At once gave him both life and liberty.</l><l>How many loving wives have often dy'd:</l><l>Drownded in tears by their cold husbands side.</l><l>And when a Sword was Executioner,</l><l>the very same hath executed her,</l><l>With he own hands; eagerly meeting death,</l><l>And scorn'd to live when he was void of breath.</l><l>If this isn't Constancy, why then the Sun</l><l>With constant Motion don't his progress run.</l><l>There's thousands of examples that will prove,</l><l>Woman is alwayes Constant in chast Love.</l><l>But when she's courted only to some Lust,</l><l>She well may change, I think the reason's just.</l><l>Change did I say, that word I must forbear,</l><l>No, she bright Star wont wander from her sphere</l><l>Of Virtue (in which Female Souls do move)</l><l>Nor will she joyn with an insatiate love.</l><l>For she whose first espoused to vertue must</l><l>Be most inconstant, when she yields to Lust.</l><l>But now the scene is alter'd, and those who</l><l>were esteemed modest by a blush or two,</l><l>Are represented quite another way,</l><l>Worse than mocke-verse doth the most solid Play.</l><l>She that takes pious Precepts for her Rule,</l><l>Is thought by some a kind of ill-bred fool;</l><l>they would have all bred up in Venus School.</l><l>And when that by her speech or carriage, she</l><l>Doth seem to have sence of a Diety,</l><l>She straight is taxt with ungentility.</l><l>Unless it be the little blinded Boy,</l><l>That Childish god, Cupid, that trifling toy,</l><l>That certain nothing, whom they feign to be</l><l>The Son of venus daughter to the Sea.</l><l>But were he true, none serve him as they shoud,</l><l>For commonly those who adore this god,</l><l>Do't only in a melancholy mood;</l><l>Or else a sort of hypocrites they are,</l><l>Who do invocate him only as a snare.</l><l>And by him they do sacred love pretend,</l><l>When as heaven knows, they have a baser end.</l><l>Nor is he god of love; but if I must</l><l>Give him a title, then he is god of lust.</l><l>And surely Woman impious must be</l><l>When e're she doth become his votary,</l><l>Unless she will believe without controul,</l><l>Those that did hold a Woman had no Soul:</l><l>And then doth think no obligation lyes</l><l>On her to act what may be just or wise.</l><l>And only strive to please her Appetite,</l><l>And to embrace that which doth most delight.</l><l>And when she doth this paradox believe,</l><l>Whatever faith doth please she may receive.</l><l>She may be Turk, Jew, Atheist, Infidel,</l><l>Or any thing, cause she need ne'er fear Hell,</l><l>For if she hath no Soul what need she fear</l><l>Something she knows not what or when or where.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>But hold I think I should be silent now,</l><l>Because a Womans Soul you do allow.</l><l>But had we none you'd say we had, else you</l><l>Could never damn us at the rate you do.</l><l>What dost thou think thou hast priviledge given,</l><l>That those whom thou dost bless shall mount to</l><l>And those thou cursest unto hell must go. (heaven,</l><l>And so dost think to fill the Abiss below</l><l>Quite full of Females, hoping there may be</l><l>No room for souls big with vice as thee.</l><l>But if that thou with such vain hopes should'st dye</l><l>I'th fluid Air, thou must not think to fly,</l><l>Or enter into heaven, thy weight of Sin</l><l>Would crush the damn'd, and so thoud'st enter in.</l><l>But hold, I am uncharitable here,</l><l>Thou may'st repent, tho' that's a thing I fear.</l><l>But if thou should'st repent, why then again</l><l>It would at best but mitigate thy pain,</l><l>Because thou hast been vile to that degree,</l><l>That thy repentance must eternal be.</l><l>For wert thou guilty of no other crime</l><l>Than what thou lately puttest into Rhime,</l><l>Why that without other offences given,</l><l>Were enough to shut the gate of Heaven.</l><l>But when together's put all thou do,</l><l>It will not only shut but bar it too.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>For when Heaven made woman it design'd</l><l>Her for the charming object of mankind.</l><l>Nor is alter'd only with those who</l><l>Set Bewly, Stratford, nay and Cheswell too,</l><l>Or other Bawds, chase their acquaintance out,</l><l>And then what they must be we make no doubt.</l><l>'Tis to make heaven mistaken when you say</l><l>It meant one and it proves another way.</l><l>For when heaven with its last greatest care,</l><l>Had form'd a female charming bright and fair,</l><l>Why then immediately it did decree,</l><l>That unto man she should a blessing be,</l><l>And so should prove to all posterity.</l><l>And surely tehre is nothing can be worse</l><l>Than for to turn a blessing to a curse.</l><l>And when the greatest blessing heaven ere gave,</l><l>And certainly the best that man could have.</l><l>When that's scorn'd and contemn'd sure it must be</l><l>A great affront unto heaven's majesty.</l><l>But I hope Heaven will punish the offence,</l><l>And with it justifie our Innocence.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>I must confess there are some bad, and they</l><l>Lead by an Ignis fatus, go astray:</l><l>All are not forc'd to wander in false way.</l><l>Only some few whose dark benighted sence,</l><l>For want of light han't power to make defence</l><l>Against those many tempting pleasures, which</l><l>Not only theirs but Masculine Souls bewitch.</l><l>But you'd persuade us, that 'tis we alone</l><l>Are guilty of all crimes and you have none,</l><l>Unless some few, which you call fools, (who be</l><l>Espous'd to wives, and live in chastity.)</l><l>But the most rational without which we</l><l>Doubtless shou'd question your Humanity.</l><l>And I would praise them more only I fear</l><l>If I should do't it would make me appear</l><l>Unto the World much fonder than i be</l><l>Of that same State, for I love Liberty,</l><l>Nor do I think there's a necessity</l><l>For all to enter Beds, like Noah's beast</l><l>Into his Ark; I would have some releast</l><l>From the dear cares of that lawful State:</l><l>Hold I'll not dictate, I'll leave all Fate.</l><l>Nor would I have the World to think that I</l><l>Through a despair do Nuptial Joys defy.</l><l>For in the World so little I have been</l><l>That I've but half a revolution seen</l><l>Of Saturn, only I do think it best</l><l>For those who love to contemplate at rest,</l><l>For to live single too, and then they may</l><l>Uninterupted, Natures Work survey.</l><l>And had my Antagonist spent his time</l><l>Making true Verse instead of spiteful Rhime,</l><l>As a Female Poet, he had gain'd some praise,</l><l>But now his malice blasts his twig of Bays.</l><l>I do not wish you had, for I believe</l><l>It is impossible for to deceive</l><l>Any with what you write, because that you</l><l>may insert things supposed true.</l><l>And if by supposition I may go,</l><l>Then I'll suppose all men are wicked too,</l><l>Because I'm sure there's many that are so.</l><l>And 'cause you have made Whores of all you could,</l><l>So if you durst, you'd say all Women would.</l><l>Which words do only argue guilt and spite:</l><l>All makes you cheap in ev'ry mortals fight.</l><l>And it doth shew that you have alwaies been</l><l>Only with Women guilty of that Sin.</l><l>You nere desired nor were you fit for those</l><l>Whose modest carriage doth their minds disclose.</l><l>And Sir, methinks you do describe so well</l><l>The way and manner Bewley enter'd Hell,</l><l>As if your love for her had made you go</l><l>Down to the black infernal shades below.</l><l>But I suppose you never was so near,</l><l>For if you had, you scarce would have been here,</l><l>For had they seen, they'd kept you there.</l><l>Unless they thought when ere it was you came,</l><l>Your hot entrance might encrease the flame.</l><l>If burning Hell add to their extreme pain,</l><l>And so were glad to turn you off again.</l><l>And likewise, also I believe beside,</l><l>That one thing more might be their haughty pride.</l><l>They knew you Rival'd them in all their Crimes,</l><l>Wherewith they could debauch the willing times.</l><l>And as fond mortals hate a rival, they</l><l>Loving through Pride, were loath to let you stay,</l><l>For fear that you might their black deeds excel,</l><l>Usurp their Seat and be the Prince of Hell.</l><l>But I believe that you will let your hate</l><l>Ore rule your bride, and you'll not wish the State</l><l>Of coverning, because your deceived mind,</l><l>Persuades your Subjects will be Women kind.</l><l>But I believe when it comes the tryal,</l><l>Ask but for ten and you'll have the denial.</l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l>You'd think your self far happier than you be,</l><l>Were you but half so sure of heaven as we.</l><l>But when you are in hell if you should find</l><l>More then I speak of, think heaven design'd</l><l>Them for a part of your Eternal Fate,</l><l>Because they're things which you so much do hate.</l><l>But why you should do so I cannot tell,</l><l>Unless 'tis what makes you in love with hell:</l><l>And having fallen out with Goodness, you</l><l>Must have Antipathy 'gainst Woman too.</l><l>For virtue and they are so near ally'd</l><l>That none can their mutual tyes divide.</l><l>Like Light and Heat, incorporate they are,</l><l>And interwove with providential care</l><l>But I'm too dull to give my Sex due praise,</l><l>The task befits a Laureat Crown'd with bays:</l><l>And yet all he can say, will be but small,</l><l>A Copy differs from the original.</l><l>For should he sleep under Parnassus Hill,</l><l>Implore the Muses for to guide his Quill.</l><l>And shou'd they help him, yet his praise would seem</l><l>At best but undervailluing disesteem.</l><l>For he would come so short of what they are</l><l>His lines won't with one single Act compare.</l><l>But to say truest, is to say that she</l><l>Is Good and Virtuous unto that degree</l><l>As you pretend she's Bad, and that's beyond</l><l>Imagination, 'cause you set no bound,</l><l>And then one certain definition is</l><l>To say that she doth comprehend all Bliss</l><l>And that she's all that's pious, chaste and true,</l><l>Heroick, constant, nay, and modest too:</l><l>The later Virtue is a thing you doubt,</l><l>But 'tis 'cause you nere sought to find it out.</l><l>You question where there's such a thing or no,</l><l>'Tis only 'cause you hope you've lost a foe,</l><l>A hated object, yet a stranger too.</l><l>I'll speak like you, if such a thing there be,</l><l>I'm certain that she doth not dwell with thee.</l><l>Thou art Antipodes to that and unto all</l><l>That's Good, or that we simply civil call.</l><l>From yokes of goodness, thou'st thy self releast,</l><l>Turn'd Bully Hector, and a humane Beast.</l><l>That Beasts do speak it rarely comes to pass,</l><l>Yet you may paralell with Baldam's Ass.</l><l>You do describe a woman so that one</l><l>Would almost think she had the Fiends outdone:</l><l>As if at her strange birth did shine no star,</l><l>Or Planet, but furies in conjunction were;</l><l>And did conspire what mischief they should do,</l><l>Each act his part and her with plagues pursue,</l><l>'Tis false in her yet tis sum'd up in you.</l><l>You almost would perswade one that you thought</l><l>That providence to a low ebb was brought;</l><l>And that to Eve and Jezabell was given</l><l>Souls of so great extent that heaven was driven</l><l>Into a Straight, and liberality</l><l>Had made her void of wanting, to supply</l><l>These later bodies, she was forc'd to take</l><l>Their fouls asunder, and so numbers make,</l><l>And transmigrate them into others and</l><l>Still shift them as she finds the matters stand.</l><l>'Tis 'cause they are the worst makes me believe</l><l>You must imagine Jezabel and Eve.</l><l>But I'm no Pythagorean to conclude</l><l>One Soul could serve for Abraham and Jude.</l><l>Or think that heaven so bankrupt or so poor,</l><l>But that each body has one soul or more.</l><l>I do not find our Sex so near ally'd,</l><l>Either in disobedience or in pride,</l><l>Unto the 'bovenamed Females (for I'm sure</l><l>They are refin'd, or else were alwaies pure)</l><l>That I must needs conceit their fouls the same,</l><l>Tho' I confess there's some that merit blame:</l><l>But yet their faults only thus much infer,</l><l>That we're not made so perfect but may err;</l><l>Which adds much lustre to a virtuous mind,</l><l>And 'tis her prudence makes her Soul confin'd</l><l>Within the bounds of goodness, for if she</l><l>Was all perfection, unto that degree</l><l>that 'twas impossible to do amiss,</l><l>Why

case,</l><l>Argues each virtue with its proper grace.</l><l>And as a womans composition is</l><l>Most soft and gentle, she has happiness</l><l>In that her soul is of that nature too,</l><l>And yields to any thing that heaven will do,</l><l>Takes an impression when 'tis seal'd in heaven,</l><l>Turns to a cold refusal, when 'tis given</l><l>By any other hand: She's all divine,</l><l>And by a

power if he could,</l><l>That is bestowed on the several Thrones</l><l>Of the worlds Monarchs, covets all their Crowns.</l><l>And by experience it hath been found</l><l>The word Ambition's not an empty sound.</l><l>There's not an history which doth not shew</l><l>Man's pride, ambition and his falshood too.</l><l>For if at any time th'ambitious have</l><l>Least shew of honour, then their souls

(his Councel is approved)</l><l>For fear he willingly should grow too great,</l><l>Desire to rule, should mount his father's Seat.</l><l>So he's dispatch'd, and then all those that be</l><l>Next in the way are his adherency.</l><l>And then the better to secure the state,</l><l>It is but just they should receive his fate.</l><l>So by degrees he for himself makes room,</l><l>His Prince is

type="stanza"><l>Their pride in some small measure I have shown,</l><l>But theirs is running over and prest down;</l><l>And 'tis impossible I should repeat</l><l>The crimes of men extravagantly
