lap. People passed and repassed her as they promenaded the long
"gallery," as it was called; they passed in couples, in trios; they
talked with unnecessary loudness, they laughed at their own and each
other's jokes; they flirted, they sentimentalized, they criticised
each other, but none of them showed any special interest in Olivia
Ferrol, nor did Miss Ferrol, on her part, show much interest in
them.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13017">She had been at Oakvale Springs for two weeks. She was alone, out
of her element, and knew nobody. The fact that she was a New Yorker,
and had never before been so far South, was rather against her. On her
arrival she had been glanced over and commented upon with
candor.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_13018" n="2 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_13019">"She is a Yankee," said the pretty and remarkably youthful-looking
mother of an apparently grown-up family from New Orleans. "You can see
it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13020">And though the remark was not meant to be exactly severe, Olivia
felt that it was very severe, indeed, under existing
circumstances. She heard it as she was giving her orders for breakfast
to her own particular jet-black and highly excitable waiter, and she
felt guilty at once and blushed, hastily taking a sip of ice-water to
conceal her confusion. When she went upstairs afterward she wrote a
very interesting letter to her brother in New York, and tried to make
an analysis of her sentiments for his edification.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13021">"You advised me to come here because it would be novel as well as
beneficial," she wrote. "And it certainly is novel. I think I feel
like a Pariah--a little. I am aware that even the best bred and most
intelligent of them, hearing that I have always lived in New York,
will privately regret it if they like me and remember it if they
dislike me. Good-natured and warm-hearted as they seem among
themselves, I am sure it will be I who will have to make the
advances--if advances are made--and I must be very amiable, indeed, if
I intend that they shall like me."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_13022" n="3 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_13023">But she had not been well enough at first to be in the humor to
make the advances, and consequently had not found her position an
exciting one. She had looked on until she had been able to rouse
herself to some pretty active likes and dislikes, but she knew no
one.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13024">She felt this afternoon as if this mild recreation of looking on
had begun rather to pall upon her, and she drew out her watch,
glancing at it with a little yawn.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13025">"It is five o'clock," she said. "Very soon the band will make its
appearance, and it will bray until the stages come in. Yes, there it
is!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13027">The musical combination to which she referred was composed of six
or seven gentlemen of color who played upon brazen instruments, each
in different keys and different time. Three times a day they collected
on a rustic kiosk upon the lawn and played divers popular airs with an
intensity, fervor, and muscular power worthy of a better cause. They
straggled up as she spoke, took their places and began, and before
they had played many minutes the most exciting event of the day
occurred, as it always did somewhere about this hour. In the midst of
the gem of their collection was heard the rattle of wheels and the
crack of whips, and through the rapturous shouts of the<pb xml:id="fblouis_13026" n="4 LOUISIANA."/> juvenile guests, the two venerable, rickety stages
dashed up with a lumbering flourish, and a spasmodic pretense of
excitement, calculated to deceive only the feeblest mind.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13028">At the end of the gallery they checked themselves in their mad
career, the drivers making strenuous efforts to restrain the
impetuosity of the four steeds whose harness rattled against their
ribs with an unpleasant bony sound. Half a dozen waiters rushed
forward, the doors were flung open, the steps let down with a bang,
the band brayed insanely, and the passengers alighted.--"One, two,
three, four," counted Olivia Ferrol, mechanically, as the first
vehicle unburdened itself. And then, as the door of the second was
opened: "One--only one: and a very young one, too. Dear me! Poor
girl!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13030">This exclamation might naturally have fallen from any quick-sighted
and sympathetic person. The solitary passenger of the second stage
stood among the crowd, hesitating, and plainly overwhelmed with
timorousness. Three waiters were wrestling with an ugly shawl, a
dreadful shining valise, and a painted wooden trunk, such as is seen
in country stores. In their enthusiastic desire to dispose creditably
of these articles they temporarily forgot the owner, who, after one
des-<pb xml:id="fblouis_13029" n="5 LOUISIANA."/>perate, timid glance at them, looked
round her in vain for succor. She was very pretty and very young and
very ill-dressed--her costume a bucolic travesty on prevailing
modes. She did not know where to go, and no one thought of showing
her; the loungers about the office stared at her; she began to turn
pale with embarrassment and timidity. Olivia Ferrol left her chair and
crossed the gallery. She spoke to a servant a little sharply:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13031">"Why not show the young lady into the parlor?" she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13032">The girl heard, and looked at her helplessly, but with
gratitude. The waiter darted forward with hospitable rapture.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13033">"Dis yeah's de way, miss," he said, "right inter de
'ception-room. Foller me, ma'am."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13034">Olivia returned to her seat. People were regarding her with
curiosity, but she was entirely oblivious of the fact.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13035">"That is one of them," she was saying, mentally. "That is one of
them, and a very interesting type it is, too."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13038">To render the peculiarities of this young woman clearer, it may be
well to reveal here something of her past life and surroundings. Her
father had been a literary man, her mother an illustrator of books and
magazine articles. From<pb xml:id="fblouis_13036" n="6 LOUISIANA."/> her earliest
childhood she had been surrounded by men and women of artistic or
literary occupations, some who were drudges, some who were geniuses,
some who balanced between the two extremes, and she had unconsciously
learned the tricks of the trade. She had been used to people who
continually had their eyes open to anything peculiar and interesting
in human nature, who were enraptured by the discovery of new types of
men, women, and emotions. Since she had been left an orphan she had
lived with her brother, who had been reporter, editor, contributor,
critic, one after the other, until at last he had established a very
enviable reputation as a brilliant, practical young fellow, who knew
his business, and had a fine career open to him. So it was natural
that, having become interested in the general friendly fashion of
dissecting and studying every scrap of human nature within reach, she
had followed more illustrious examples, and had become very critical
upon the subject of "types" herself. During her sojourn at Oakvale she
had studied the North Carolinian mountaineer "type" with the
enthusiasm of an amateur. She had talked to the women in sunbonnets
who brought fruit to the hotel, and sat on the steps and floor of the
galleries awaiting the advent of customers<pb xml:id="fblouis_13037" n="7 LOUISIANA."/>
with a composure only to be equaled by the calmness of the noble
savage; she had walked and driven over the mountain roads, stopping at
wayside houses and entering into conversation with the owners until
she had become comparatively well known, even in the space of a
fortnight, and she had taken notes for her brother until she had
roused him to sharing her own interest in her discoveries.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13040">"I am sure you will find a great deal of material here," she wrote
to him. "You see how I have fallen a victim to that dreadful habit of
looking at everything in the light of material. A man is no longer a
man--he is 'material'; sorrow is not sorrow, joy is not joy--it is
'material.' There is something rather ghoulish in it. I wonder if
anatomists look at people's bodies as we do at their minds, and if to
them every one is a 'subject.' At present I am interested in a species
of girl I have discovered. Sometimes she belongs to the better
class--the farmers, who have a great deal of land and who are the rich
men of the community,--sometimes she lives in a log cabin with a
mother who smokes and chews tobacco, but in either case she is a
surprise and a mystery. She is always pretty, she is occasionally
beautiful, and in spite of her house, her people, her education or<pb xml:id="fblouis_13039" n="8 LOUISIANA."/> want of it, she is instinctively a refined and
delicately susceptible young person. She has always been to some
common school, where she has written compositions on sentimental or
touching subjects, and when she belongs to the better class she takes
a fashion magazine and tries to make her dresses like those of the
ladies in the colored plates, and, I may add, frequently fails. I
could write a volume about her, but I wont. When your vacation
arrives, come and see for yourself." It was of this class Miss Ferrol
was thinking when she said: "That is one of them, and a very intering
type it is, too."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13042">When she went in to the dining-room to partake of the six o'clock
supper, she glanced about her in search of the new arrival, but she
had not yet appeared. A few minutes later, however, she entered. She
came in slowly, looking straight before her, and trying very hard to
appear at ease. She was prettier than before, and worse dressed. She
wore a blue, much-ruffled muslin and a wide collar made of imitation
lace. She had tucked her sleeves up to her elbow with a band and bow
of black velvet, and her round, smooth young arms were adorable. She
looked for a vacant place, and, seeing none, stopped short, as if she
did not know what to do. Then<pb xml:id="fblouis_13041" n="9 LOUISIANA."/> some magnetic
attraction drew her eye to Olivia Ferrol's. After a moment's pause,
she moved timidly toward her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13043">"I--I wish a waiter would come," she faltered.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13044">At that moment one on the wing stopped in obedience to a gesture of
Miss Ferrol's--a delicate, authoritative movement of the head.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13045">"Give this young lady that chair opposite me," she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13046">The chair was drawn out with a flourish, the girl was seated, and
the bill of fare was placed in her hands.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13047">"Thank you," she said, in a low, astonished voice.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13048">Olivia smiled.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13049">"That waiter is my own special and peculiar property," she said,
"and I rather pride myself on him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13050">But her guest scarcely seemed to comprehend her pleasantry. She
looked somewhat awkward.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13051">"I--don't know much about waiters," she ventured. "I'm not used to
them, and I suppose they know it. I never was at a hotel before."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13052">"You will soon get used to them," returned Miss Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13054">The girl fixed her eyes upon her with a ques<pb xml:id="fblouis_13053" n="10 LOUISIANA."/>
tioning appeal. They were the loveliest eyes she had ever seen, Miss
Ferrol thought--large-irised, and with wonderful long lashes fringing
them and curling upward, giving them a tender, very wide-open
look. She seemed suddenly to gain courage, and also to feel it her
duty to account for herself.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13055">"I shouldn't have come here alone if I could have got father to
come with me," she revealed. "But he wouldn't come. He said it wasn't
the place for him. I haven't been very well since mother died, and he
thought I'd better try the Springs awhile. I don't think I shall like
it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13056">"I don't like it," replied Miss Ferrol, candidly, "but I dare say
you will when you know people."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13057">The girl glanced rapidly and furtively over the crowded room, and
then her eyes fell.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13058">"I shall never know them," she said, in a depressed undertone.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13059">In secret Miss Ferrol felt a conviction that she was right; she had
not been presented under the right auspices.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13060">"It is rather clever and sensitive in her to find it out so
quickly," she thought. "Some girls would be more sanguine, and be led
into blunders."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13062">They progressed pretty well during the meal.<pb xml:id="fblouis_13061" n="11 LOUISIANA."/> When it was over, and Miss Ferrol rose, she became
conscious that her companion was troubled by some new difficulty, and
a second thought suggested to her what its nature was.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13063">"Are you going to your room?" she asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13064">"I don't know," said the girl, with the look of helpless appeal
again. "I don't know where else to go. I don't like to go out there"
(signifying the gallery) "alone."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13065">"Why not come with me?" said Miss Ferrol. "Then we can promenade
together."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13066">"Ah!" she said, with a little gasp of relief and gratitude. "Don't
you mind?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13067">"On the contrary, I shall be very glad of your society," Miss
Ferrol answered. "I am alone, too."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13068">So they went out together and wandered slowly from one end of the
starlit gallery to the other, winding their way through the crowd that
promenaded, and, upon the whole, finding it rather pleasant.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13069">"I shall have to take care of her," Miss Ferrol was deciding; "but
I do not think I shall mind the trouble."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13071">The thing that touched her most was the girl's innocent trust in
her sincerity--her taking for granted that this stranger, who had been
polite to<pb xml:id="fblouis_13070" n="12 LOUISIANA."/> her, had been so not for worldly
good breeding's sake, but from true friendliness and extreme
generosity of nature. Her first shyness conquered, she related her
whole history with the unreserve of a child. Her father was a farmer,
and she had always lived with him on his farm. He had been too fond of
her to allow her to leave home, and she had never been "away to
school."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13072">"He has made a pet of me at home," she said. "I was the only one
that lived to be over eight years old. I am the eleventh. Ten died
before I was born, and it made father and mother worry a good deal
over me--and father was worse than mother. He said the time never
seemed to come when he could spare me. He is very good and kind--is
father," she added, in a hurried, soft-voiced way. " He's rough, but
he's very good and kind."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13073">Before they parted for the night Miss Ferrol had the whole
genealogical tree by heart. They were an amazingly prolific family, it
seemed. There was Uncle Josiah, who had ten children, Uncle Leander,
who had fifteen, Aunt Amanda, who had twelve, and Aunt Nervy, whose
belongings comprised three sets of twins and an unlimited supply of
odd numbers. They went upstairs together and parted at Miss Ferrol's
door, their rooms being near each other.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_13074" n="13 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_13075">The girl held out her hand.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13076">"Good-night!" she said. "I'm so thankful I've got to know you."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13077">Her eyes looked bigger and wider-open than ever; she smiled,
showing her even, sound, little white teeth. Under the bright light of
the lamp the freckles the day betrayed on her smooth skin were not to
be seen.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13078">"Dear me!" thought Miss Ferrol. "How startlingly pretty, in spite
of the cotton lace and the dreadful polonaise!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13079">She touched her lightly on the shoulder.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13080">"Why, you are as tall as I am!" she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13081">"Yes," the girl replied, depressedly; "but I'm twice as broad."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13082">"Oh no--no such thing." And then, with a delicate glance down over
her, she said--"It is your dress that makes you fancy so. Perhaps your
dressmaker does not understand your figure,"--as if such a failing was
the most natural and simple thing in the world, and needed only the
slightest rectifying.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13083">"I have no dressmaker," the girl answered. "I make my things
myself. Perhaps that is it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13085">"It is a little dangerous, it is true," replied Miss Ferrol. "I
have been bold enough to try it myself, and I never succeeded. I could
give<pb xml:id="fblouis_13084" n="14 LOUISIANA."/> you the address of a very thorough
woman if you lived in New York."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13086">"But I don't live there, you see. I wish I did. I never shall,
though. Father could never spare me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13087">Another slight pause ensued, during which she looked admiringly at
Miss Ferrol. Then she said "good-night " again, and turned away.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13088">But before she had crossed the corridor she stopped.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13089">"I never told you my name," she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13090">Miss Ferrol naturally expected she would announce it at once, but
she did not. An air of embarrassment fell upon her. She seemed almost
averse to speaking.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13091">"Well," said Miss Ferrol, smiling, "what is it?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13092">She did not raise her eyes from the carpet as she replied,
unsteadily:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13093">"It's Louisiana."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13094">Miss Ferrol answered her very composedly: "The name of the
state?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13095">"Yes. Father came from there."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13096">"But you did not tell me your surname."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13097">"Oh! that is Rogers. You--you didn't laugh. I thought you
would."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_13099">"At the first name?" replied Miss Ferrol.<pb xml:id="fblouis_13098" n="15 LOUISIANA."/> "Oh no. It is unusual--but names often are. And Louise
is pretty."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130100">"So it is," she said, brightening. "I never thought of that. I hate
Louisa. They will call it 'Lowizy,' or 'Lousyanny.' I could sign
myself Louise, couldn't I?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130101">"Yes," Miss Ferrol replied.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130102">And then her <hi rend="italic">protÃ©gÃ©e</hi> said
"good-night" for the third time, and disappeared.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130103" n="[16]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_012" n="2" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER II.<lb/>WORTH.</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130104">SHE presented herself at the bed-room door with a timid knock the
next morning before breakfast, evidently expecting to be taken charge
of. Miss Ferrol felt sure she would appear, and had, indeed, dressed
herself in momentary expectation of hearing the knock.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130105">When she heard it she opened the door at once. "I am glad to see
you," she said. "I thought you might come."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130106">A slight expression of surprise showed itself in the girl's
eyes. It had never occurred to her that she might not come.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130107">"Oh, yes," she replied. "I never could go down alone when there was
any one who would go with me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130108">There was something on her mind, Miss Ferrol fancied, and presently
it burst forth in a confidential inquiry.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130109" n="17 WORTH"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130110">"Is this dress very short-waisted?" she asked, with great
earnestness.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130111">Merciful delicacy stood in the way of Miss Ferrol's telling her how
short-waisted it was, and how it maltreated her beautiful young
body.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130112">"It is rather short-waisted, it is true."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130113">"Perhaps," the girl went on, with a touch of guileless melancholy,
"I am naturally this shape."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130114">Here, it must be confessed, Miss Ferrol forgot herself for the
moment, and expressed her indignation with undue fervor.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130115">"Perish the thought!" she exclaimed. "Why, child! your figure is a
hundred times better than mine."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130116">Louisiana wore for a moment a look of absolute fright.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130117">"Oh, no!" she cried. "Oh, no. Your figure is magnificent."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130118">"Magnificent!" echoed Miss Ferrol, giving way to her enthusiasm,
and indulging in figures of speech. "Don't you see that I am
thin--absolutely thin. But my things fit me, and my dressmaker
understands me. If you were dressed as I am,"--pausing to look her
over from head to foot--"Ah!" she exclaimed, pathetically, "how I
should like to see you in some of my clothes!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130120">A tender chord was touched. A gentle sad-<pb xml:id="fblouis_130119" n="18 LOUISIANA."/>ness, aroused by this instance of wasted opportunities,
rested upon her. But instantaneously she brightened, seemingly without
any particular cause. A brilliant idea had occurred to her. But she
did not reveal it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130121">"I will wait," she thought, "until she is more at her ease with
me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130122">She really was more at her ease already. Just this one little scrap
of conversation had done that. She became almost affectionate in a shy
 way before they reached the dining-room.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130123">"I want to ask you something," she said, as they neared the
door.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130124">"What is it?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130125">She held Miss Ferrol back with a light clasp on her arm. Her air
was quite tragic in a small way.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130126">"Please say 'Louise,' when you speak to me," she said. "Never say
'Miss Louisiana'--never--never!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130127">"No, I shall never say 'Miss Louisiana,'" her companion
answered. "How would you like 'Miss Rogers?'"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130128">"I would rather have 'Louise,'" she said, disappointedly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130129">"Well," returned Miss Ferrol, "'Louise' let it be."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130131">And "Louise" it was thenceforward. If she<pb xml:id="fblouis_130130" n="19 WORTH."/>
had not been so pretty, so innocent, and so affectionate and humble a
young creature, she might have been troublesome at times (it occurred
to Olivia Ferrol), she clung so pertinaciously to their chance
acquaintanceship; she was so helpless and desolate if left to herself,
and so inordinately glad to be taken in hand again. She made no new
friends, which was perhaps natural enough, after all. She had nothing
in common with the young women who played ten-pins and croquet and
rode out in parties with their cavaliers. She was not of them, and
understood them as little as they understood her. She knew very well
that they regarded her with scornful tolerance when they were of the
ill-natured class, and with ill-subdued wonder when they were
amiable. She could not play ten-pins or croquet, nor could she
dance.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130132">"What are the men kneeling down for, and why do they keep stopping
to put on those queer little caps and things?" she whispered to Miss
Ferrol one night.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130133">"They are trying to dance a German," replied Miss Ferrol, "and the
man who is leading them only knows one figure."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130135">As for the riding, she had been used to riding all her life; but no
one asked her to join them,<pb xml:id="fblouis_130134" n="20 LOUISIANA."/> and if they had
done so she would have been too wise,--unsophisticated as she was,--to
accept the invitation. So where Miss Ferrol was seen she was seen
also, and she was never so happy as when she was invited into her
protector's room and allowed to spend the morning or evening
there. She would have been content to sit there forever and listen to
Miss Ferrol's graphic description of life in the great world. The
names of celebrated personages made small impression upon her. It was
revealed gradually to Miss Ferrol that she had private doubts as to
the actual existence of some of them, and the rest she had never heard
of before.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130136">"You never read 'The Scarlet Letter?'" asked her instructress upon
one occasion.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130137">She flushed guiltily.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130138">"No," she answered. "Nor--nor any of the others."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130139">Miss Ferrol gazed at her silently for a few moments. Then she asked
her a question in a low voice, specially mellowed, so that it might
not alarm her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130140">"Do you know who John Stuart Mill is?" she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130141">"No," she replied from the dust of humiliation.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130142" n="21 WORTH"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130143">"Have you never heard--just <hi rend="italic">heard</hi>--of
Ruskin?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130144">"No."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130145">"Nor of Michael Angelo?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130146">"N--no--ye-es, I think so--perhaps, but I don't know what he
did."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130147">"Do you," she continued, very slowly,
"do--you--know--anything--about--Worth?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130148">"No, nothing."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130149">Her questioner clasped her hands with repressed emotion.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130150">"Oh," she cried, "how--how you have been neglected!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130151">She was really depressed, but her <hi rend="italic">protÃ©gÃ©e</hi> was so much more deeply so
that she felt it her duty to contain herself and return to
cheerfulness.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130152">"Never mind," she said. "I will tell you all I know about them,
and,"--after a pause for speculative thought upon the
subject,--"by-the-by, it isn't much, and I will lend you some books to
read, and give you a list of some you must persuade your father to buy
for you, and you will be all right. It is rather dreadful not to know
the names of people and things; but, after all, I think there are very
few people who--ahem!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130154">She was checked here by rigid conscientious<pb xml:id="fblouis_130153" n="22 LOUISIANA"/> scruples. If she was to train this young mind in the path
of learning and literature, she must place before her a higher
standard of merit than the somewhat shady and slipshod one her
eagerness had almost betrayed her into upholding. She had heard people
talk of "standards" and "ideals," and when she was kept to the point
and in regulation working order, she could be very eloquent upon these
subjects herself.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130155">"You will have to work very seriously," she remarked, rather
incongruously and with a rapid change of position. "If you wish to--to
acquire anything, you must read conscientiously and--and with a
purpose." She was rather proud of that last clause.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130156">"Must I?" inquired Louise, humbly. "I should like to--if I knew
where to begin. Who was Worth? Was he a poet?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130157">Miss Ferrol acquired a fine, high color very suddenly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130158">"Oh," she answered, with some uneasiness, "you--you have no need to
begin with Worth. He doesn't matter so much--really."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130159">"I thought," Miss Rogers said meekly, "that you Were inure troubled
about my not having read o hat he wrote, than about my not knowing any
of the others."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130160" n="23 WORTH."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130161">"Oh, no. You see--the fact is, he--he never wrote anything."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130162">"What did he do?" she asked, anxious for information.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130163">"He--it isn't 'did,' it is 'does.' He--makes dresses."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130164">"Dresses!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130165">This single word, but no exclamation point could express its tone
of wild amazement.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130166">"Yes."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130167">"A man!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130168">"Yes."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130169">There was a dead silence. It was embarrassing at first. Then the
amazement of the unsophisticated one began to calm itself; it
gradually died down, and became another emotion, merging itself into
interest.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130170">"Does"--guilelessly she inquired--"he make nice ones?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130171">"Nice!" echoed Miss Ferrol."They are works of art! I have got three
in my trunk."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130172">"O-o-h!" sighed Louisiana. "Oh, dear!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130173">Miss Ferrol rose from her chair.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130174">"I will show them to you," she said. "I--I--should like you to try
them on."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130175">"To try them on!" ejaculated the child in an awe-stricken
tone. "Me?"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130176" n="24 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130177">"Yes," said Miss Ferrol, unlocking the trunk and throwing back the
lid. "I have been wanting to see you in them since the first day you
came."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130178">She took them out and laid them upon the bed on their trays. Louise
got up from the floor and approaching, reverently stood near
them. There was a cream-colored evening-dress of soft, thick,
close-clinging silk of some antique-modern sort; it had golden fringe,
and golden flowers embroidered upon it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130179">"Look at that," said Miss Ferrol, softly--even religiously.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130180">She made a mysterious, majestic gesture.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130181">"Come here," she said. "You must put it on."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130182">Louise shrank back a pace.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130183">"I--oh! I daren't," she cried. "It is too beautiful!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130184">"Come here," repeated Miss Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130186">She obeyed timorously, and gave herself into the hands of her
controller. She was so timid and excited that she trembled all the
time her toilette was being performed for her. Miss Ferrol went
through this service with the manner of a priestess officiating at an
altar. She laced up the back of the dress with the slender, golden
cords;<pb xml:id="fblouis_130185" n="25 WORTH."/> she arranged the antique drapery which
wound itself around in close swathing folds. There was not the shadow
of a wrinkle from shoulder to hem: the lovely young figure was
revealed in all its beauty of outline. There were no sleeves at all,
there was not very much bodice, but there was a great deal of effect,
and this, it is to be supposed, was the object.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130187">"Walk across the floor," commanded Miss Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130188">Louisiana obeyed her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130189">"Do it again," said Miss Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130190">Having been obeyed for the second time, her hands fell
together. Her attitude and expression could be said to be significant
only of rapture.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130191">"I said so!" she cried. "I said so! You might have been born in New
York!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130192">It was a grand climax. Louisiana felt it to the depths of her
reverent young heart. But she could not believe it. She was sure that
it was too sublime to be true. She shook her head in deprecation.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130193">"It is no exaggeration," said Miss Ferrol, with renewed
fervor. "Laurence himself, if he were not told that you had lived
here, would never guess it. I should like to try you on him."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130194" n="26 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130195">"Who--is he?" inquired Louisiana. "Is he a writer, too?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130196">"Well, yes,--but not exactly like the others. He is my
brother."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130197">It was two hours before this episode ended. Only at the sounding of
the second bell did Louisiana escape to her room to prepare for
dinner.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130198">Miss Ferrol began to replace the dresses in her trunk. She
performed her task in an abstracted mood. When she had completed it
she stood up-right and paused a moment, with quite a startled air.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130199">"Dear me!" she exclaimed. "I--actually forgot about
Ruskin!"</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130200" n="[27]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_013" n="3" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER III.<lb/>"HE IS DIFFERENT."</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130201">THE same evening, as they sat on one of the seats upon the lawn,
Miss Ferrol became aware several times that Louisiana was regarding
her with more than ordinary interest. She sat with her hands folded
upon her lap, her eyes fixed on her face, and her pretty mouth
actually a little open.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130202">"What are you thinking of?" Olivia asked, at length.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130203">The girl started, and recovered herself with an effort.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130204">"I--well, I was thinking about--authors," she stammered.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130205">"Any particular author?" inquired Olivia, "or authors as a
class?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130206">"About your brother being one. I never thought I should see any one
who knew an author--and you are related to one!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130208">Her companion's smile was significant of im-<pb xml:id="fblouis_130207" n="28 LOUISIANA."/>mense experience. It was plain that she was so accustomed
to living on terms of intimacy with any number of authors that she
could afford to feel indifferent about them.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130209">"My dear," she said, amiably, "they are not in the least different
from other people."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130210">It sounded something like blasphemy.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130211">"Not different!" cried Louisiana. "Oh, surely, they must be!
Isn't--isn't your brother different?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130212">Miss Ferrol stopped to think. She was very fond of her
brother. Privately she considered him the literary man of his day. She
was simply disgusted when she heard experienced critics only calling
him "clever" and "brilliant" instead of "great" and
"world-moving."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130213">"Yes," she replied at length, "he is different."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130214">"I thought he must be," said Louisiana, with a sigh of relief. "You
are, you know."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130215">"Am I?" returned Olivia. "Thank you. But I am not an author--at
least,"--she added, guiltily, "nothing I have written has ever been
published."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130216">"Oh, why not?" exclaimed Louisiana.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130217">"Why not?" she repeated, dubiously and thoughtfully. And then,
knitting her brows, she said, "I don't know why not."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130218" n="29 'HE IS DIFFERENT.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130219">"I am sure if you have ever written anything, it ought to have been
published," protested her adorer.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130220">"<hi rend="italic">I</hi> thought so," said Miss Ferrol. "But--but
<hi rend="italic">they</hi> didn't."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130221">"They?" echoed Louisiana. "Who are 'they?'"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130222">"The editors," she replied, in a rather gloomy manner. "There is a
great deal of wire-pulling, and favoritism, and--even envy and malice,
of which those outside know nothing. You wouldn't understand it if I
should tell you about it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130223">For a few moments she wore quite a fell expression, and gloom
reigned. She gave her head a little shake.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130224">"They regret it afterward," she remarked,--"frequently."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130225">From which Louisiana gathered that it was the editors who were so
overwhelmed, and she could not help sympathizing with them in
secret. There was something in the picture of their unavailing remorse
which touched her, despite her knowledge of the patent fact that they
deserved it and could expect nothing better. She was quite glad when
Olivia brightened up, as she did presently.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130227">"Laurence is handsomer than most of them,<pb xml:id="fblouis_130226" n="30 LOUISIANA."/> and has a more distinguished air," she said. "He is very
charming. People always say so."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130228">"I wish I could see him," ventured Louisiana.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130229">"You will see him if you stay here much longer," replied Miss
Ferrol. "It is quite likely he will come to Oakvale."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130230">For a moment Louisiana fluttered and turned pale with pleasure, but
as suddenly she drooped.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130231">"I forgot," she faltered. "You will have to be with him always, and
I shall have no one. He won't want me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130232">Olivia sat and looked at her with deepening interest. She was
thinking again of a certain whimsical idea which had beset her several
times since she had attired her <hi rend="italic">protÃ©gÃ©e</hi> in the cream-colored
robe.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130233">"Louise," she said, in a low, mysterious tone, "how would you like
to wear dresses like mine all the rest of the time you are here?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130234">The child stared at her blankly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130235">"I haven't got any," she gasped.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130236">"No," said Miss Ferrol, with deliberation, "but <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130237">She rose from her seat, dropping her mysterious air and smiling
encouragingly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130238">"Come with me to my room," she said. "I want to talk to
you."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130239" n="31 'HE IS DIFFERENT'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130240">If she had ordered her to follow her to the stake it is not at all
unlikely that Louisiana would have obeyed. She got up meekly, smiling,
too, and feeling sure something very interesting was going to
happen. She did not understand in the least, but she was quite
tractable. And after they had reached the room and shut themselves in,
she found that it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> something very interesting which was to
happen.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130241">"You remember what I said to you this morning?" Miss Ferrol
suggested.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130242">"You said so many things."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130243">"Oh, but you cannot have forgotten this particular thing. I said
you looked as if you had been born in New York."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130244">Louisiana remembered with a glow of rapture. "Oh, yes," she
answered.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130245">"And I said Laurence himself would not know, if he was not told,
that you had lived all your life here."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130246">"Yes."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130247">"And I said I should like to try you on him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130248">"Yes."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130249">Miss Ferrol kept her eyes fixed on her and watched her closely.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130250">"I have been thinking of it all the morning," she added. "I should
like to try you on him."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130251" n="32 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130252">Louisiana was silent a moment. Then she spoke, hesitatingly:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130253">"Do you mean that I should pretend--," she began.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130254">"Oh, no," interrupted Miss Ferrol. "Not pretend either one thing or
the other. Only let me dress you as I choose, and then take care that
you say nothing whatever about your past life. You will have to be
rather quiet, perhaps, and let him talk. He will like that, of
course--men always do--and then you will learn a great many things
from him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130255">"It will be--a very strange thing to do," said Louisiana.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130256">"It will be a very interesting thing," answered Olivia, her
enthusiasm increasing. "How he will admire you!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130257">Louisiana indulged in one of her blushes. "Have you a picture of
him?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130258">"Yes. Why?" she asked, in some surprise.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130259">"Because I should like to see his face."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130260">"Do you think," Miss Ferrol said, in further bewilderment, "that
you might not like him?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130261">"I think he might not like me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130262">"Not like you!" cried Miss Ferrol. "You! He will think you are
divine--when you are dressed as I shall dress you."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130263" n="33 'HE IS DIFFERENT.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130264">She went to her trunk and produced the picture. It was not a
photograph, but a little crayon head--the head of a handsome man,
whose expression was a singular combination of dreaminess and
alertness. It was a fascinating face.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130265">"One of his friends did it," said Miss Ferrol. "His friends are
very fond of him and admire his good looks very much. They protest
against his being photographed. They like to sketch him. They are
always making 'studies' of his head. What do you think of him?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130266">Louisiana hesitated.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130267">"He is different," she said at last. "I thought he would be."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130268">She gave the picture back to Miss Ferrol, who replaced it in her
trunk. She sat for a few seconds looking down at the carpet and
apparently seeing very little. Then she looked up at her companion,
who was suddenly a little embarrassed at finding her receive her
whimsical planning so seriously. She herself had not thought of it as
being serious at all. It would be interesting and amusing, and would
prove her theory.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130269">"I will do what you want me to do," said Louisiana.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130271">"Then," said Miss Ferrol, wondering at an un-<pb xml:id="fblouis_130270" n="34 LOUISIANA."/>expected sense of discomfort in herself, "I will dress
you for supper now. You must begin to wear the things, so that you may
get used to them."</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130272" n="[35]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_014" n="4" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IV.<lb/>A NEW TYPE.</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130273">WHEN the two entered the supper-room together a little commotion
was caused by their arrival. At first the supple young figure in
violet and gray was not recognized. It was not the figure people had
been used to, it seemed so tall and slenderly round. The reddish-brown
hair was combed high and made into soft puffs; it made the pretty head
seem more delicately shaped, and showed how white and graceful the
back of the slender neck was. It was several minutes before the
problem was solved. Then a sharp young woman exclaimed, <hi rend="italic">sotto voce</hi>:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130274">"It's the little country-girl, in new clothes--in clothes that
fit. Would you believe it?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130275">"Don't look at your plate so steadily," whispered Miss
Ferrol. "Lean back and fan yourself as if you did not hear. You must
never show that you hear things."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130276" n="36 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130277">"I shall be obliged to give her a few hints now and then," she had
said to herself beforehand. "But I feel sure when she once catches the
cue she will take it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130278">It really seemed as if she did, too. She had looked at herself long
and steadily after she had been dressed, and when she turned away from
the glass she held her head a trifle more erect, and her cheeks had
reddened. Perhaps what she had recognized in the reflection she had
seen had taught her a lesson. But she said nothing. In a few days
Olivia herself was surprised at the progress she had made. Sanguine as
she was, she had not been quite prepared for the change which had
taken place in her. She had felt sure it would be necessary to teach
her to control her emotions, but suddenly she seemed to have learned
to control them without being told to do so; she was no longer
demonstrative of her affection, she no longer asked innocent
questions, nor did she ever speak of her family. Her reserve was
puzzling to Olivia.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130279">"You are very clever," she said to her one day, the words breaking
from her in spite of herself, after she had sat regarding her in
silence for a few minutes. "You are even cleverer than I thought you
Were, Louise."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130280" n="37 A NEW TYPE."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130281">"Was that very clever?" the girl asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130282">"Yes, it was," Olivia answered, "but not so clever as you are
proving yourself."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130283">But Louisiana did not smile or blush, as she had expected she
would. She sat very quietly, showing neither pleasure nor shyness, and
seeming for a moment or so to be absorbed in thought.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130284">In the evening when the stages came in they were sitting on the
front gallery together. As the old rattletraps bumped and swung
themselves up the gravel drive, Olivia bent forward to obtain a better
view of the passengers.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130285">"He ought to be among them," she said. Louisiana laid her hand on
her arm.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130286">"Who is that sitting with the driver?" she asked, as the second
vehicle passed them. "Isn't that--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130287">"To be sure it is!" exclaimed Miss Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130288">She would have left her seat, but she found herself detained. Her
companion had grasped her wrist.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130289">"Wait a minute!" she said. "Don't leave me! Oh--I wish I had not
done it!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130290">Miss Ferrol turned and stared at her in amazement.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130291">She spoke in her old, uncontrolled, childish fashion. She was pale,
and her eyes were dilated.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130292" n="38 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130293">"What is the matter?" said Miss Ferrol, hurriedly, when she found
her voice. "Is it that you really don't like the idea? If you don't,
there is no need of our carrying it out. It was only nonsense--I beg
your pardon for not seeing that it disturbed you. Perhaps, after all,
it was very bad taste in me--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130294">But she was not allowed to finish her sentence. As suddenly as it
had altered before, Louisiana's expression altered again. She rose to
her feet with a strange little smile. She looked into Miss Ferrol's
astonished face steadily and calmly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130295">"Your brother has seen you and is coming toward us," she said. "I
will leave you. We shall see each other again at supper."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130296">And with a little bow she moved away with an air of composure which
left her instructress stunned. She could scarcely recover her
equilibrium sufficiently to greet her brother decently when he reached
her side. She had never been so thoroughly at sea in her
life.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130297">After she had gone to her room that night, her brother came and
knocked at the door.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130298">When she opened it and let him in he walked to a chair and threw
himself into it, wearing a rather excited look.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130299" n="39 A NEW TYPE."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130300">"Olivia," he began at once, "what a bewildering girl I--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130301">Olivia sat down opposite to him, with a composed smile.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130302">"Miss Rogers, of course?" she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130303">"Of course," he echoed. And then, after a pause of two or three
seconds, he added, in the tone he had used before: "What a
delightfully mysterious girl!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130304">"Mysterious!" repeated Olivia.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130305">"There is no other word for it! She has such an adorable face, she
looks so young, and she says so little." And then, with serious
delight, he added: "It is a new type!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130306">Olivia began to laugh.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130307">"Why are you laughing?" he demanded.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130308">"Because I was so sure you would say that," she answered. "I was
waiting for it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130310">"But it is true," he replied, quite vehemently. "I never saw
anything like her before. I look at her great soft eyes and I catch
glimpses of expression which don't seem to belong to the rest of
her. When I see her eyes I could fancy for a moment that she had been
brought up in a convent or had lived a very simple, isolated life, but
when she speaks and moves I am bewildered. I want to hear her talk,
but she says so little. She does not even dance. I suppose her
relatives are serious<pb xml:id="fblouis_130309" n="40 LOUISIANA."/> people. I dare say
you have not heard much of them from her. Her reserve is so
extraordinary in a girl. I wonder how old she is?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130311">"Nineteen, I think."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130312">"I thought so. I never saw anything prettier than her quiet way
when I asked her to dance with me. She said, simply, 'I do not
dance. I have never learned.' It was as if she had never thought of it
as being an unusual thing."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130313">He talked of her all the time he remained in the room. Olivia had
never seen him so interested before.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130314">"The fascination is that she seems to be two creatures at once," he
said. "And one of them is stronger than the other and will break out
and reveal itself one day. I begin by feeling I do not understand her,
and that is the most interesting of all beginnings. I long to discover
which of the two creatures is the real one."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130315">When he was going away he stopped suddenly to say:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130316">"How was it you never mentioned her in your letters? I can't
understand that."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130317">"I wanted you to see her for yourself," Olivia answered. "I thought
I would wait."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130318">"Well," he said, after thinking a moment, "I am glad, after all,
that you did."</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130319" n="[41]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_015" n="5" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER V.<lb/>"I HAVE HURT YOU."</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130321">FROM the day of his arrival a new life began for Louisiana. She was
no longer an obscure and unconsidered young person. Suddenly, and for
the first time in her life, she found herself vested with a marvellous
power. It was a power girls of a different class from her own are
vested with from the beginning of their lives. They are used to it and
regard it as their birthright. Louisiana was not used to it. There had
been nothing like it attending her position as "that purty gal o'
Rogerses." She was accustomed to the admiration of men she was
indifferent to--men who wore short-waisted blue-jean coats, and turned
upon their elbows to stare at her as she sat in the little white frame
church. After making an effort to cultivate her acquaintance, they
generally went away disconcerted. "She's mighty still," they
said. "She haint got nothin' to say. Seems like<pb xml:id="fblouis_130320" n="42 LOUISIANA."/> thar aint much to her--but she's powerful purty
though."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130322">This was nothing like her present experience. She began slowly to
realize that she was a little like a young queen now. Here was a man
such as she had never spoken to before, who was always ready to
endeavor to his utmost to please her: who, without any tendency toward
sentimental nonsense, was plainly the happier for her presence and
favor. What could be more assiduous and gallant than the everyday
behavior of the well-bred, thoroughly experienced young man of the
period toward the young beauty who for the moment reigns over his
fancy! It need only be over his fancy; there is no necessity that the
impression should be any deeper. His suavity, his chivalric air, his
ready wit in her service, are all that could be desired.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130323">When Louisiana awakened to the fact that all this homage was
rendered to her as being only the natural result of her girlish
beauty--as if it was the simplest thing in the world, and a state of
affairs which must have existed from the first--she experienced a
sense of terror. Just at the very first she would have been glad to
escape from it and sink into her old obscurity.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130325">"It does not belong to me," she said to herself.<pb xml:id="fblouis_130324" n="43 'I HAVE HURT YOU.'"/> "It belongs to some one else--to the girl he thinks
I am. I am not that girl, though; I will remember that."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130326">But in a few days she calmed down. She told herself that she always
did remember, but she ceased to feel frightened and was more at
ease. She never talked very much, but she became more familiar with
the subjects she heard discussed. One morning she went to Olivia's
room and asked her for the address of a bookseller.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130327">"I want to send for some books and--and magazines," she said,
confusedly. "I wish you--if you would tell me what to send for. Father
will give me the money if I ask him for it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130328">Olivia sat down and made a list. It was a long list, comprising the
best periodicals of the day and several standard books.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130329">When she handed it to her she regarded her with curiosity.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130330">"You mean to read them all?" she asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130331">"Isn't it time that I should?" replied her pupil.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130332">"Well--it is a good plan," returned Olivia, rather absently.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130334">Truth to tell, she was more puzzled every day. She had begun to be
quite sure that something had happened. It seemed as if a slight
coldness<pb xml:id="fblouis_130333" n="44 LOUISIANA."/> existed between herself and her
whilom adorer. The simplicity of her enthusiasm was gone. Her
affection had changed as her outward bearing. It was a better
regulated and less noticeable emotion. Once or twice Olivia fancied
she had seen the girl looking at her even sadly, as if she felt, for
the moment, a sense of some loss.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130335">"Perhaps it was very clumsy in me," she used to say to
herself. "Perhaps I don't understand her, after all."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130337">But she could not help looking on with interest. She had never
before seen Laurence enjoy himself so thoroughly. He had been working
very hard during the past year, and was ready for his holiday. He
found the utter idleness, which was the chief feature of the place, a
good thing. There was no town or village within twenty miles,
newspapers were a day or two old when they arrived, there were very
few books to be found, and there was absolutely no excitement. At
night the band brayed in the empty-looking ball-room, and a few very
young couples danced, in a desultory fashion and without any
ceremony. The primitive, domesticated slowness of the place was
charming. Most of the guests had come from the far South at the
beginning of the season and would remain until the close of it; so
they had had time to be<pb xml:id="fblouis_130336" n="45 'I HAVE HURT YOU'"/>come familiar
with each other and to throw aside restraint.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130338">"There is nothing to distract one," Ferrol said, "nothing to rouse
one, nothing to inspire one--nothing! It is delicious! Why didn't I
know of it before?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130339">He had plenty of time to study his sister's friend. She rode and
walked with him and Olivia when they made their excursions, she
listened while he read aloud to them as he lay on the grass in a quiet
corner of the grounds. He thought her natural reserve held her from
expressing her opinion on what he read very freely; it certainly did
not occur to him that she was beginning her literary education under
his guidance. He could see that the things which pleased him most were
not lost upon her. Her face told him that. One moonlight night, as
they sat on an upper gallery, he began to speak of the novelty of the
aspect of the country as it presented itself to an outsider who saw it
for the first time.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130340">"It is a new life, and a new people," he said. "And, by the way,
Olivia, where is the new species of young woman I was to see--the
daughter of the people who does not belong to her sphere?"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130341" n="46 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130342">He turned to Louisiana.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130343">"Have you ever seen her?" he asked. "I must confess to a
dubiousness on the subject."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130344">Before he could add another word Louisiana turned upon him. He
could see her face clearly in the moonlight. It was white, and her
eyes were dilated and full of fire.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130345">"Why do you speak in that way?" she cried. "As if--as if such
people were so far beneath you. What right have you--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130346">She stopped suddenly. Laurence Ferrol was gazing at her in
amazement. She rose from her seat, trembling.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130347">"I will go away a little," she said. "I beg your pardon--and Miss
Ferrol's."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130348">She turned her back upon them and went away. Ferrol sat holding her
little round, white-feather fan helplessly, and staring after her
until she disappeared.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130349">It was several seconds before the silence was broken. It was he who
broke it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130350">"I don't know what it means," he said, in a low voice. "I don't
know what I have done!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130352">In a little while he got up and began to roam aimlessly about the
gallery. He strolled from one end to the other with his hands thrust
in his coat pockets. Olivia, who had remained seated,<pb xml:id="fblouis_130351" n="47 'I HAVE HURT YOU.'"/> knew that he was waiting in hopes that Louisiana
would return. He had been walking to and fro, looking as miserable as
possible, for about half an hour, when at last she saw him pause and
turn half round before the open door of an upper corridor leading out
upon the verandah. A black figure stood revealed against the inside
light. It was Louisiana, and, after hesitating a moment, she moved
slowly forward.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130353">She had not recovered her color, but her manner was perfectly
quiet.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130354">"I am glad you did not go away," she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130355">Ferrol had only stood still at first, waiting her pleasure, but the
instant she spoke he made a quick step toward her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130356">"I should have felt it a very hard thing not to have seen you again
before I slept," he said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130357">She made no reply, and they walked together in silence until they
reached the opposite end of the gallery.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130358">"Miss Ferrol has gone in," she said then.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130359">He turned to look and saw that such was the case. Suddenly, for
some reason best known to herself, Olivia had disappeared from the
scene.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130361">Louisiana leaned against one of the slender, supporting pillars of
the gallery. She did not look at Ferrol, but at the blackness of the
moun-<pb xml:id="fblouis_130360" n="48 LOUISIANA."/>tains rising before them. Ferrol could
not look away from her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130362">"If you had not come out again," he said, after a pause, "I think I
should have remained here, baying at the moon, all night."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130363">Then, as she made no reply, he began to pour himself forth quite
recklessly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130364">"I cannot quite understand how I hurt you," he said. "It seemed to
me that I must have hurt you, but even while I don't understand, there
are no words abject enough to express what I feel now and have felt
during the last half hour. If I only dared ask you to tell me--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130365">She stopped him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130366">"I can't tell you," she said. "But it is not your fault--it is
nothing you could have understood--it is my fault--all my fault,
and--I deserve it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130367">He was terribly discouraged.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130368">"I am bewildered," he said. "I am very unhappy."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130369">She turned her pretty, pale face round to him swiftly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130370">"It is not you who need be unhappy," she exclaimed.	"It is I!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130371">The next instant she had checked herself again, just as she had
done before.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130372" n="49 'I HAVE HURT YOU.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130373">"Let us talk of something else," she said, coldly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130374">"It will not be easy for me to do so," he answered, "but I will
try."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130375">Before Olivia went to bed she had a visit from her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130376">She received her with some embarrassment, it must be confessed. Day
by day she felt less at ease with her and more deeply self-convicted
of some blundering,--which, to a young woman of her temperament, was a
sharp penalty.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130377">Louisiana would not sit down. She revealed her purpose in coming at
once.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130378">"I want to ask you to make me a promise," she said, "and I want to
ask your pardon."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130379">"Don't do that," said Olivia.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130381">"I want you to promise that you will not tell your brother the
truth until you have left here and are at home. I shall go away very
soon. I am tired of what I have been doing. It is different from what
you meant it to be. But you must promise that if you stay after I have
gone--as of course you will--you will not tell him. My home is only a
few miles away. You might be tempted, after thinking it over, to come
and see me--and I should not like it. I want it all to<pb xml:id="fblouis_130380" n="50 LOUISIANA."/> stop here--I mean my part of it. I don't want to know
the rest."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130382">Olivia had never felt so helpless in her life. She had neither
self-poise, nor tact, nor any other daring quality left.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130383">"I wish," she faltered, gazing at the girl quite pathetically, "I
wish we had never begun it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130384">"So do I." said Louisiana. "Do you promise?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130385">"I--yes. I would promise anything. I--I have hurt your feelings,"
she confessed, in an outbreak.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130386">She was destined to receive a fresh shock. All at once the girl was
metamorphosed again. It was her old ignorant, sweet, simple self who
stood there, with trembling lips and dilated eyes.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130387">"Yes, you have!" she cried. "Yes, you have!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130388">And she burst into tears and turned about and ran out of the
room.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130389" n="[51]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_016" n="6" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VI.<lb/>THE ROAD TO THE RIGHT.</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130390">THE morning after, Ferrol heard an announcement which came upon him
like a clap of thunder.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130391">After breakfast, as they walked about the grounds, Olivia, who had
seemed to be in an abstracted mood, said, without any preface:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130392">"Miss Rogers returns home to-morrow."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130393">Laurence stopped short in the middle of the path.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130394">"To-morrow!" he exclaimed. "Oh, no." He glanced across at Louisiana
with an anxious face.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130395">"Yes," she said, "I am going home."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130396">"To New York?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130397">"I do not live in New York."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130399">She spoke quite simply, but the words were a shock to him. They
embarrassed him. There was no coldness in her manner, no displeasure
in her tone, but, of course, he understood that it<pb xml:id="fblouis_130398" n="52 LOUISIANA."/> would be worse than tactless to inquire further. Was it
possible that she did not care that he should know where she lived?
There seemed no other construction to be placed upon her words. He
flushed a little, and for a few minutes looked rather gloomy, though
he quickly recovered himself afterward and changed the subject with
creditable readiness.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130400">"Did not you tell me she lived in New York?" he asked Olivia, the
first time they were alone together.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130401">"No," Olivia answered, a trifle sharply. "Why New York, more than
another place?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130402">"For no reason whatever,--really," he returned, more bewildered
than ever. "There <hi rend="italic">was</hi> no reason why I should
choose New York, only when I spoke to her of certain places there,
she--she--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130403">He paused and thought the matter over carefully before finishing
his sentence. He ended it at last in a singular manner.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130404">"She said nothing," he said. "It is actually true now I think of
it--she said nothing whatever!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130405">"And because she said nothing whatever--"began Olivia.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130406">He drew his hand across his forehead with a puzzled
gesture.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130407" n="53 THE ROAD TO THE RIGHT."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130408">"I fancied she <hi rend="italic">looked</hi> as if she knew," he said, slowly. "I am sure
she looked as if she knew what I was talking about--as if she knew the
places, I mean. It is very queer! There seems no reason in it. Why
shouldn't she wish us to know where she lives?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130409">"I--I must confess," cried Olivia, "that I am getting a little
tired of her."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130410">It was treacherous and vicious, and she knew it was; but her guilty
conscience and her increasing sense of having bungled drove her to
desperation. If she had not promised to keep the truth to herself, she
would have been only too glad to unburden herself. It was so stupid,
after all, and she had only herself to blame.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130411">Laurence drew a long breath.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130412">"You cannot be tired of <hi rend="italic">her!</hi>" he said. "That is impossible. She
takes firmer hold upon one every hour."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130414">This was certainly true, as far as he was concerned. He was often
even surprised at his own enthusiasm. He had seen so many pretty women
that it was almost inconsistent that he should be so much moved by the
prettiness of one charming creature, and particularly one who spoke so
little, who, after all, was--but there he always found himself at a
full stop. He could not say what she<pb xml:id="fblouis_130413" n="54 LOUISIANA."/> was,
he did not know yet; really, he seemed no nearer the solution of the
mystery than he had been at first. There lay the fascination. He felt
so sure there was an immense deal for him to discover, if he could
only discover it. He had an ideal in his mind, and this ideal, he felt
confident; was the real creature, if he could only see her. During the
episode on the upper gallery he fancied he had caught a glimpse of
what was to be revealed. The sudden passion on her pale young face,
the fire in her eyes, were what he had dreamed of.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130415">If he had not been possessed of courage and an honest faith in
himself, born of a goodly amount of success, he would have been far
more depressed than he was. She was going away, and had not encouraged
him to look forward to their meeting again.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130416">"I own it is rather bad to look at," he said to himself, "if one
quite believed that Fate would serve one such an ill turn. She never
played me such a trick, however, and I won't believe she will. I shall
see her again--sometime. It will turn out fairly enough, surely."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130418">So with this consolation he supported himself. There was one day
left and he meant to make the best of it. It was to be spent in
driving to a cer-<pb xml:id="fblouis_130417" n="55 THE ROAD TO THE RIGHT."/>tain mountain,
about ten miles distant. All tourists who were possessed of sufficient
energy made this excursion as a matter of duty, if from no more
enthusiastic motive. A strong, light carriage and a pair of horses
were kept in the hotel stables for the express purpose of conveying
guests to this special point.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130419">This vehicle Ferrol had engaged the day before, and as matters had
developed he had cause to congratulate himself upon the fact. He said
to Louisiana what he had before said to himself:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130420">"We have one day left, and we will make the best of it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130422">Olivia, who stood upon the gallery before which the carriage had
been drawn up, glanced at Louisiana furtively. On her part she felt
privately that it would be rather hard to make the best of it. She
wished that it was well over. But Louisiana did not return her
glance. She was looking at Ferrol and the horses. She had done
something new this morning. She had laid aside her borrowed splendor
and attired herself in one of her own dresses, which she had had the
boldness to remodel. She had seized a hint from some one of Olivia's
possessions, and had given her costume a pretty air of primitive
simplicity. It was a plain white lawn, with a little frilled cape or
fichu which<pb xml:id="fblouis_130421" n="56 LOUISIANA."/> crossed upon her breast, and
was knotted loosely behind. She had a black velvet ribbon around her
lithe waist, a rose in her bosom where the fichu crossed, and a broad
Gainsborough hat upon her head. One was reminded somewhat of the
picturesque young woman of the good old colony times. Ferrol, at
least, when he first caught sight of her, was reminded of pictures he
had seen of them.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130423">There was no trace of her last night's fire in her manner. She was
quieter than usual through the first part of the drive. She was gentle
to submissiveness to Olivia. There was something even tender in her
voice once or twice when she addressed her. Laurence noticed it, and
accounted for it naturally enough.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130424">"She is really fonder of her than she has seemed," he thought, "and
she is sorry that their parting is so near."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130425">He was just arriving at this conclusion when Louisiana touched his
arm.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130426">"Don't take that road," she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130427">He drew up his horses and looked at her with surprise. There were
two roads before them, and he had been upon the point of taking the
one to the right.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130429">"But it is the only road to take," he continued.<pb xml:id="fblouis_130428" n="57 THE ROAD TO THE RIGHT."/> "The other does not lead to the mountain. I was
told to be sure to take the road to the right hand."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130430">"It is a mistake," she said, in a disturbed tone. "The left-hand
road leads to the mountain, too--at least, we can reach it by striking
the wagon-road through the woods. I--yes, I am sure of it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130431">"But this is the better road. Is there any reason why you prefer
the other? Could you pilot us? If you can--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130432">He stopped and looked at her appealingly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130433">He was ready to do anything she wished, but the necessity for his
yielding had passed. Her face assumed a set look.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130434">"I can't," she answered. "Take the road to the right. Why
not?"</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130435" n="[58]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_017" n="7" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VII.<lb/>"SHE AIN'T YERE."</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130436">FERROL was obliged to admit when they turned their faces homeward
that the day was hardly a success, after all. Olivia had not been at
her best, for some reason or other, and from the moment they had taken
the right-hand road Louisiana had been wholly incomprehensible.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130438">In her quietest mood she had never worn a cold air before; to-day
she had been cold and unresponsive. It had struck him that she was
absorbed in thinking of something which was quite beyond him. She was
plainly not thinking of him, nor of Olivia, nor of the journey they
were making. During the drive she had sat with her hands folded upon
her lap, her eyes fixed straight before her. She had paid no attention
to the scenery, only rousing herself to call their attention to one
object. This object was a house they passed--the rambling, low-roofed
white house of<pb xml:id="fblouis_130437" n="59 'SHE AIN'T YERE.'"/> some well-to-do
farmer. It was set upon a small hill and had a long front porch,
mottled with blue and white paint in a sanguine attempt at imitating
variegated marble.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130439">She burst into a low laugh when she saw it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130440">"Look at that," she said. "That is one of the finest houses in the
country. The man who owns it is counted a rich man among his
neighbors."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130441">Ferrol put up his eye-glasses to examine it. (It is to be deplored
that he was a trifle near-sighted.)</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130442">"By George!" he said. "That is an idea, isn't it, that marble
business! I wonder who did it? Do you know the man who lives
there?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130443">"I have heard of him," she answered, "from several people. He is a
namesake of mine. His name is Rogers."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130444">When they returned to their carriage, after a ramble up the
mountain-side, they became conscious that the sky had suddenly
darkened. Ferrol looked up, and his face assumed a rather serious
expression.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130445">"If either of you is weather-wise," he said, "I wish you would tell
me what that cloud means. You have been among the mountains longer
than I have."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130446" n="60 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130447">Louisiana glanced upward quickly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130448">"It means a storm," she said, "and a heavy one. We shall be
drenched in half an hour."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130449">Ferrol looked at her white dress and the little frilled fichu,
which was her sole protection.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130450">"Oh, but that won't do!" he exclaimed. "What insanity in me not to
think of umbrellas!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130451">"Umbrellas!" echoed Louisiana. "If we had each six umbrellas they
could not save us. We may as well get into the carriage. We are only
losing time."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130452">They were just getting in when an idea struck Ferrol which caused
him to utter an exclamation of ecstatic relief.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130453">"Why," he cried, "there is that house we passed! Get in quickly. We
can reach there in twenty minutes."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130454">Louisiana had her foot upon the step. She stopped short and turned
to face him. She changed from red to white and from white to red
again, as if with actual terror.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130455">"There!" she exclaimed. "There!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130456">"Yes," he answered. "We can reach there in time to save
ourselves. Is there any objection to our going,--in the last
extremity?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130458">For a second they looked into each other's<pb xml:id="fblouis_130457" n="61 'SHE AINT YERE.'"/> eyes, and then she turned and sprang into the carriage. She
laughed aloud.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130459">"Oh, no," she said. "Go there! It will be a nice place to stay--and
the people will amuse you. Go there."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130460">They reached the house in a quarter of an hour instead of twenty
minutes. They had driven fast and kept ahead of the storm, but when
they drew up before the picket fence the clouds were black and the
thunder was rolling behind them.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130461">It was Louisiana who got out first. She led the way up the path to
the house and mounted the steps of the variegated porch. She did not
knock at the door, which stood open, but, somewhat to Ferrol's
amazement, walked at once into the front room, which was plainly the
room of state. Not to put too fine a point upon it, it was a hideous
room.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130463">The ceiling was so low that Ferrol felt as if he must knock his
head against it; it was papered--ceiling and all--with paper of an
unwholesome yellow enlivened with large blue flowers; there was a
bedstead in one corner, and the walls were ornamented with colored
lithographs of moon-faced houris, with round eyes and round, red
cheeks, and wearing low-necked dresses, and flowers in their bosoms,
and bright<pb xml:id="fblouis_130462" n="62 LOUISIANA."/> yellow gold necklaces. These
works of art were the first things which caught Ferrol's eye, and he
went slowly up to the most remarkable, and stood before it, regarding
it with mingled wonderment and awe.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130464">He turned from it after a few seconds to look at Louisiana, who
stood near him, and he beheld what seemed to him a phenomenon. He had
never seen her blush before as other women blush--now she was
blushing, burning red from chin to brow.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130465">"There--there is no one in this part of the house," she said. "I--I
know more of these people than you do. I will go and try to find some
one."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130466">She was gone before he could interpose. Not that he would have
interposed, perhaps. Somehow--without knowing why--he felt as if she
did know more of the situation than he did--almost as if she were, in
a manner, doing the honors for the time being.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130467">She crossed the passage with a quick, uneven step, and made her
way, as if well used to the place, into the kitchen at the back of the
house.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130468">A stout negro woman stood at a table, tilling a pan with newly made
biscuits. Her back was toward the door and she did not see who
entered.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130469" n="63 'SHE AIN'T YERE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130470">"Aunt Cassandry," the girl began, when the woman turned toward
her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130471">"Who's dar?" she exclaimed. "Lor', honey, how ye skeert me! I aint
no C'sandry."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130472">The face she turned was a strange one, and it showed no sign of recognition of her visitor.
It was an odd thing that the sight of her unfamiliar face should have
been a shock to Louisiana; but it was a shock. She put her hand to her
side.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130473">"Where is my--where is Mr. Rogers?" she asked. "I want to see
him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130474">"Out on de back po'ch, honey, right now. Dar he goes!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130475">The girl heard him, and flew out to meet him. Her heart was
throbbing hard, and she was drawing quick, short breaths.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130476">"Father!" she cried. "Father! Don't go in the house!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130477">And she caught him by both shoulders and drew him round. He did not
know her at first in her fanciful-simple dress and her Gainsborough
hat. He was not used to that style of thing, believing that it
belonged rather to the world of pictures. He stared at her. Then he
broke out with an exclamation,</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130478">"Lo--rd! Louisianny!"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130479" n="64 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130480">She kept her eyes on his face. They were feverishly bright, and her
cheeks were hot. She laughed hysterically.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130481">"Don't speak loud," she said. "There are some strange people in the
house, and--and I want to tell you something."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130482">He was a slow man, and it took him some time to grasp the fact that
she was really before him in the flesh. He said, again:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130483">"Lord, Louisianny!" adding, cheerfully, "How ye've serprised
me!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130484">Then he took in afresh the change in her dress. There was a pile of
stove-wood stacked on the porch to be ready for use, and he sat down
on it to look at her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130485">"Why, ye've got a new dress on!" he said. "Thet thar's what made ye
look sorter curis. I hardly knowed ye."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130486">Then he remembered what she had said on first seeing him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130487">"Why don't ye want me to go in the house?" he asked. "What sort o'
folks air they?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130488">"They came with me from the Springs," she answered; "and--and I
want to--to play a joke on them."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130489">She put her hands up to her burning cheeks, and stood so.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130490" n="65 'SHE AIN'T YERE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130491">"A joke on 'em?" he repeated.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130492">"Yes," she said, speaking very fast. "They don't know I live here,
they think I came from some city,--they took the notion
themselves,--and I want to let them think so until we go away from the
house. It will be such a good joke."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130493">She tried to laugh, but broke off in the middle of a harsh
sound. Her father, with one copperas-colored leg crossed over the
other, was chewing his tobacco slowly, after the manner of a
ruminating animal, while he watched her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130494">"Don't you see?" she asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130495">"Wa-al, no," he answered. "Not rightly."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130496">She actually assumed a kind of spectral gayety.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130497">"I never thought of it until I saw it was not Cassandry who was in
the kitchen," she said. "The woman who is there didn't know me, and it
came into my mind that--that we might play off on them," using the
phraseology to which he was the most accustomed.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130498">"Waal, we mought," he admitted, with a speculative
deliberateness. "Thet's so. We mought--if thar was any use in it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130499">"It's only for a joke," she persisted, hurriedly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130500">"Thet's so," he repeated. "Thet's so."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130502">He got up slowly and rather lumberingly from<pb xml:id="fblouis_130501" n="66 LOUISIANA."/> his seat and dusted the chips from his copperas-colored
legs.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130503">"Hev ye ben enjyin' yerself, Louisianny?" he asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130504">"Yes," she answered. "Never better."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130505">"Ye must hev," he returned, "or ye wouldn't be in sperrits to play
jokes."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130506">Then he changed his tone so suddenly that she was startled.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130507">"What do ye want me to do?" he asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130508">She put her hand on his shoulder and tried to laugh again.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130509">"To pretend you don't know me--to pretend I have never been here
before. That's joke enough. isn't it? They will think so when I tell
them the truth. You slow old father! Why don't you laugh?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130510">"P'r'aps," he said, "it's on account o' me been' slow,
Louisianny. Mebbe I shall begin arter awhile."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130511">"Don't begin at the wrong time," she said, till keeping up her
feverish laugh, "or you'll spoil it all. Now come along in and--and
pretend you don't know me," she continued, drawing him forward by the
arm. "They might suspect something if we stay so long. All you've got
to do is to pretend you don't know me."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130512" n="67 'SHE AINT YERE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130513">"Thet's so, Louisianny," with a kindly glance downward at her
excited face as he followed her out. "Thar aint no call fur me to do
nothin' else, is there--just pretend I don't know ye?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130514">It was wonderful how well he did it, too. When she preceded him
into the room the girl was quivering with excitement. He might break
down, and it would be all over in a second. But she looked Ferrol
boldly in the face when she made her first speech.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130515">"This is the gentleman of the house," she said. "I found him on the
back porch. He had just come in. He has been kind enough to say we may
stay until the storm is over."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130516">"Oh, yes," said he hospitably, "stay an' welcome. Ye aint the first
as has stopped over. Storms come up sorter suddent, an' we haint the
kind as turns folks away."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130517">Ferrol thanked him, Olivia joining in with a murmur of
gratitude. They were very much indebted to him for his hospitality;
they considered themselves very fortunate.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130518">Their host received their protestations with much equanimity.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130520">"If ye'd like to set out on the front porch and watch the storm
come up," he said, "thar's seats thar. Or would ye druther set here?
Women<pb xml:id="fblouis_130519" n="68 LOUSIANA."/>folks is gen'rally fond o' settin'
in-doors whir thar's a parlor."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130521">But they preferred the porch, and followed him out upon it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130522">Having seen them seated, he took a chair himself. It was a
split-seated chair, painted green, and he tilted it back against a
pillar of the porch and applied himself to the full enjoyment of a
position more remarkable for ease than elegance. Ferrol regarded him
with stealthy rapture, and drank in every word he uttered.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130523">"This," he had exclaimed delightedly to Olivia, in private--"why,
this is delightful! These are the people we have read of. I scarcely
believed in them before. I would not have missed it for the
world!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130524">"In gin'ral, now," their entertainer proceeded, "wimmin-folk is
fonder o' settin' in parlors. My wife was powerful sot on her
parlor. She wasn't never satisfied till she hed one an' hed it fixed
up to her notion. She was alters tradin' fur picters fur it. She tuk a
heap o' pride in her picters. She allers had it in her mind that her
little gal should have a showy parlor when she growed up."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130525">"You have a daughter?" said Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130527">Their host hitched his chair a little to one side.<pb xml:id="fblouis_130526" n="69 'SHE AINT YERE.'"/> He bent forward to expectorate, and then
answered with his eyes fixed upon some distant point toward the
mountains.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130528">"Wa-al, yes," he said; "but she aint yere, Louisianny aint."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130529">Miss Ferrol gave a little start, and immediately made an effort to
appear entirely at ease.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130530">"Did you say," asked Ferrol, "that your daughter's name was--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130531">"Louisianny," promptly. "I come from thar."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130532">Louisiana got up and walked to the opposite end of the porch.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130533">"The storm will be upon us in a few minutes," she said. "It is
beginning to rain now. Come and look at this cloud driving over the
mountain-top."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130534">Ferrol rose and went to her. He stood for a moment looking at the
cloud, but plainly not thinking of it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130535">"His daughter's name is Louisiana," he said, in an
undertone. "Louisiana! Isn't that delicious?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130536">Suddenly, even as he spoke, a new idea occurred to him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130537">"Why," he exclaimed, "your name is Louise, isn't it? I think Olivia
said so."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130538" n="70 LOUSIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130539">"Yes," she answered, "my name is Louise."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130540">"How should you have liked it," he inquired, absent-mindedly, "if
it had been Louisiana?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130541">She answered him with a hard coolness which it startled him
afterward to remember.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130542">"How would you have liked it?" she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130543">They were driven back just then by the rain, which began to beat in
upon their end of the porch. They were obliged to return to Olivia and
Mr. Rogers, who were engaged in an animated conversation.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130544">The fact was that, in her momentary excitement, Olivia had plunged
into conversation as a refuge. She had suddenly poured forth a stream
of remark and query which had the effect of spurring up her companion
to a like exhibition of frankness. He had been asking questions,
too.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130545">"She's ben tellin' me," he said, as Ferrol approached, "thet you're
a littery man, an' write fur the papers--novel-stories, an' pomes an'
things. I never seen one before--not as I know on."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130546">"I wonder why not!" remarked Ferrol. "We are plentiful enough."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130547">"Air ye now?" he asked reflectively. "I had an idee thar was only
one on ye now an' ag'in--jest now an' ag'in."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130548">He paused there to shake his head.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130549" n="71 'SHE AINT YERE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130550">"I've often wondered how ye could do it," he said. "<hi rend="italic">I</hi> couldn't. Thar's some as thinks they could if
they tried, but I wa'n't never thataway--I wa'n't never thataway. I
haint no idee I could do it, not if I tried ever so. Seems to me," he
went on, with the air of making an announcement of so novel a nature
that he must present it modestly, "seems to me, now, as if them as
does it must hev a kinder gift fur it, now. Lord! I couldn't write a
novel. I wouldn't know whar to begin."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130551">"It is difficult to decide where," said Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130552">He did not smile at all. His manner was perfect--so full of
interest, indeed, that Mr. Rogers quite warmed and expanded under
it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130553">"The scenes on 'em all, now, bein' mostly laid in Bagdad, would be
agin me, if nothin' else war," he proceeded.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130554">"Being laid--?" queried Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130555">"In Bagdad or--wa-al, furrin parts tharabouts. Ye see I couldn't
tell nothin' much about no place but North Ca'liny, an' folks wouldn't
buy it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130556">"But why not?" exclaimed Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130558">"Why, Lord bless ye!" he said, hilariously, "they'd know it wa'n't
true. They'd say in a minnit: 'Why, thar's thet fool Rogers ben a
writin' a pack o' lies thet aint a word on it true.<pb xml:id="fblouis_130557" n="72 LOUISIANA."/> Thar aint no castles in Hamilton County, an' thar aint
no folks like these yere. It just aint so!' I 'lowed thet thar was the
reason the novel-writers allers writ about things a-happenin' in
Bagdad. Ye kin say most anythin' ye like about Bagdad an' no one
cayn't contradict ye."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130559">"I don't seem to remember many novels of--of that particular
description," remarked Ferrol, in a rather low voice. "Perhaps my
memory--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130560">"Ye don't?" he queried, in much surprise. "Waal now, jest you
notice an' see if it aint so. I haint read many novels myself. I haint
read but one--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130561">"Oh!" interposed Ferrol. "And it was a story of life in
Bagdad."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130562">"Yes; an' I've heard tell of others as was the same. Hance
Claiborn, now, he was a-tellen me of one."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130563">He checked himself to speak to the negro woman who had presented
herself at a room door.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130564">"We're a-comin', Nancy," he said, with an air of
good-fellowship. "Now, ladies an' gentlemen," he added, rising from
his chair, "walk in an' have some supper."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130565">Ferrol and Olivia rose with some hesitation.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130566">"You are very kind," they said. "We did not intend to give you
trouble."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130567" n="73 'SHE AINT YERE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130568">"Trouble!" he replied, as if scarcely comprehending. "This yere
aint no trouble. Ye haint ben in North Ca'liny before, hev ye?" he
continued, good-naturedly. "We're bound to hev ye eat, if ye stay with
us long enough. We wouldn't let ye go 'way without eatin', bless
ye. We aint that kind. Walk straight in."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130569">He led them into a long, low room, half kitchen, half
dining-room. It was not so ugly as the room of state, because it was
entirely unadorned. Its ceiled walls were painted brown and stained
with many a winter's smoke. The pine table was spread with a clean
homespun cloth and heaped with well-cooked, appetizing food.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130570">"If ye can put up with country fare, ye'll not find it so bad,"
said the host. "Nancy prides herself on her way o' doin' things."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130572">There never was more kindly hospitality, Ferrol thought. The simple
generosity which made them favored guests at once warmed and touched
him. He glanced across at Louisiana to see if she was not as much
pleased as he was himself. But the food upon her plate remained almost
untouched. There was a strange look on her face; she was deadly pale
and her downcast eyes shone under their lashes. She did not look at
their host<pb xml:id="fblouis_130571" n="74 LOUISIANA."/> at all; it struck Ferrol that
she avoided looking at him with a strong effort. Her pallor made him
anxious.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130573">"You are not well," he said to her. "You do not look well at
all."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130574">Their host started and turned toward her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130575">"Why, no ye aint!" he exclaimed, quite tremulously. "Lord, no! Ye
cayn't be. Ye haint no color. What--what's the trouble, Lou--Lord! I
was gwine to call ye Louisianny, an'--she aint yere, Louisianny
aint."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130576">He ended with a nervous laugh.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130577">"I'm used to takin' a heap o' care on her," he said. "I've lost ten
on 'em, an' she's all that's left me, an'--an' I think a heap on
her. I--I wish she was yere. Ye musn't git sick, ma'am."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130578">The girl got up hurriedly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130579">"I am not sick, really," she said. "The thunder--I have a little
headache. I will go out on to the porch. It's clearing up now. The
fresh air will do me good."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130580">The old man rose, too, with rather a flurried manner.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130581">"If Louisianny was yere," he faltered, "she could give ye something
to help ye. Camphire now--sperrits of camphire--let me git ye
some."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130582">"No--no," said the girl. "No, thank you."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130583" n="75 'SHE AINT YERE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130584">And she slipped out of the door and was gone. Mr. Rogers sat down
again with a sigh.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130585">"I wish she'd let me git her some," he said, wistfully. "I know how
it is with young critters like that. They're dele-cate,"
anxiously. "Lord, they're dele-cate. They'd oughter hev' their mothers
round 'em. I know how it is with Louisianny."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130586">A cloud seemed to settle upon him. He rubbed his grizzled chin with
his hand again and again, glancing at the open door as he did it. It
was evident that his heart was outside with the girl who was like
"Louisianny."</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130587" n="[76]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_018" n="8" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER VIII.<lb/>"NOTHING HAS HURT YOU."</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130588">THE storm was quite over, and the sun was setting in flames of gold
when the meal was ended and they went out on the porch
again. Mr. Rogers had scarcely recovered himself, but he had made an
effort to do so, and had so far succeeded as to begin to describe the
nature of the one novel he had read. Still, he had rubbed his chin and
kept his eye uneasily on the door all the time he had been
talking.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130589">"It was about a Frenchman," he said, seriously, "an' his name
was--Frankoyse--F-r-a-n-c-o-i-s, Frankoyse. Thet thar's a French name,
aint it? Me an' Ianthy 'lowed it was common to the country. It don't
belong yere, Frankoyse don't, an' it's got a furrin sound."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130590">"It--yes, it is a French name," assented Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130592">A few minutes afterward they went out. Lou<pb xml:id="fblouis_130591" n="77 'NOTHING HAS HURT YOU.'"/>isiana stood at the end of the porch, leaning against
a wooden pillar and twisting an arm around it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130593">"Are ye better?" Mr. Rogers asked. "I am goin' to 'tend to my
stock, an' if ye aint, mebbe the camphire--sperrits of camphire--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130594">"I don't need it," she answered. "I am quite well."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130595">So he went away and left them, promising to return shortly and
"gear up their critters" for them that they might go on their way.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130596">When he was gone, there was a silence of a few seconds which Ferrol
could not exactly account for. Almost for the first time in his
manhood, he did not know what to say. Gradually there had settled upon
him the conviction that something had gone very wrong indeed, that
there was something mysterious and complicated at work, that somehow
he himself was involved, and that his position was at once a most
singular and delicate one. It was several moments before he could
decide that his best plan seemed to be to try to conceal his
bewilderment and appear at ease. And, very naturally, the speech he
chose to begin with was the most unlucky he could have hit upon.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130598">"He is charming," he said. "What a lovable old fellow! What a
delicious old fellow! He<pb xml:id="fblouis_130597" n="78 LOUISIANA."/> has been telling
me about the novel. It is the the story of a Frenchman, and his
name--try to guess his name."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130599">But Louisiana did not try.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130600">"You couldn't guess it," he went on. "It is better than all the
rest. His name was--Frankoyse."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130601">That instant she turned round. She was shaking all over like a
leaf.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130602">"Good heavens!" flashed through his mind. "This is a climax! <hi rend="italic">This</hi> is the real creature!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130603">"Don't laugh again!" she cried. "Don't dare to laugh! I wont bear
it! He is my father!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130604">For a second or so he had not the breath to speak.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130605">"<hi rend="italic">Your</hi> father!" he said, when he found his
voice. "<hi rend="italic">Your</hi> father! <hi rend="italic">Yours!</hi>"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130606">"Yes," she answered, "mine. This is my home. I have lived here all
my life--my name is Louisiana. You have laughed at me too!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130607">It was the real creature, indeed, whom he saw. She burst into
passionate tears.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130609">"Do you think that I kept up this pretense to-day because I was
ashamed of him?" she said. "Do you think I did it because I did not
love him--and respect him--and think him better than<pb xml:id="fblouis_130608" n="79 'NOTHING HAS HURT YOU.'"/> all the rest of the world? It was because I
loved him so much that I did it--because I knew so well that you would
say to each other that he was not like me--that he was rougher, and
that it was a wonder I belonged to him. It is a wonder I belong to
him! I am not worthy to kiss his shoes. I have been ashamed--I have
been bad enough for that, but not bad enough to be ashamed of him. I
thought at first it would be better to let you believe what you
would--that it would soon be over, and we should never see each other
again, but I did not think that I should have to sit by and see you
laugh because he does not know the world as you do--because he has
always lived his simple, good life in one simple, country place."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130610">Ferrol had grown as pale as she was herself. He groaned aloud.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130611">"Oh!" he cried, "what shall I say to you? For heaven's sake try to
understand that it is not at him I have laughed, but--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130612">"He has never been away from home," she broke in. "He has worked
too hard to have time to read, and--" she stopped and dropped her
hands with a gesture of unutterable pride. "Why should I tell you
that?" she said. "It sounds as if I were apologizing for him, and
there is no need that I should."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130613" n="80 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130614">"If I could understand," began Ferrol,--"if I could realize--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130615">"Ask your sister," she replied. "It was her plan. I--I" (with a
little sob) "am only her experiment."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130616">Olivia came forward, looking wholly subdued. Her eyes were wet,
too.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130617">"It is true," she said. "It is all my fault."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130618">"May I ask you to explain?" said Ferrol, rather sternly. "I suppose
some of this has been for my benefit."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130619">"Don't speak in that tone," said Olivia. "It is bad enough as it
is. I--I never was so wretched in my life. I never dreamed of its
turning out in this way. She was so pretty and gentle and quick to
take a hint, and--I wanted to try the experiment--to see if you would
guess at the truth. I--I had a theory, and I was so much interested
that--I forgot to--to think of her very much. I did not think she
would care."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130620">Louisiana broke in.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130622">"Yes," she said, her eyes bright with pain, "she forgot. I was very
fond of her, and I knew so very little that she forgot to think of
me. I was only a kind of plaything--but I was too proud to remind
her. I thought it would be soon over, and I knew how ignorant I was. I
was<pb xml:id="fblouis_130621" n="81 'NOTHING HAS HURT YOU.'"/> afraid to trust my
feelings at first. I thought perhaps--it was vanity, and I ought to
crush it down. I was very fond of her."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130623">"Oh!" cried Olivia, piteously, "don't say 'was,' Louise!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130624">"Don't say 'Louise,'" was the reply. "Say 'Louisiana.' I am not
ashamed of it now. I want Mr. Ferrol to hear it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130625">"I have nothing to say in self-defense," Laurence replied,
hopelessly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130626">"There is nothing for any of us to say but good-by," said
Louisiana. "We shall never see each other again. It is all over
between us. You will go your way and I shall go mine. I shall stay
here to-night. You must drive back to the Springs without me. I ought
never to have gone there."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130627">Laurence threw himself into a chair and sat shading his face with
his hand. He stared from under it at the shining wet grass and
leaves. Even yet he scarcely believed that all this was true. He felt
as if he were walking in a dream. The worst of it was this desperate
feeling that there was nothing for him to say. There was a long
silence, but at last Louisiana left her place and came and stood
before him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130629">"I am going to meet my father," she said.<pb xml:id="fblouis_130628" n="82 LOUISIANA."/> "I persuaded him that I was only playing a joke. He
thought it was one of my fancies, and he helped me out because I asked
him to do it. I am going to tell him that I have told you the
truth. He wont know why I did it. I will make it easy for you. I shall
not see you again. Good-by."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130630">Ferrol's misery got the better of him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130631">"I can't bear this!" he cried, springing up. "I can't, indeed."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130632">She drew back.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130633">"Why not?" she said. "Nothing has hurt <hi rend="italic">you</hi>."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130634">The simple coldness of her manner was very hard upon him,
indeed.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130635">"You think I have no right to complain," he answered, "and yet see
how you send me away! You speak as if you did not intend to let me see
you again--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130636">"No," she interposed, "you shall not see me again. Why should you?
Ask your sister to tell you how ignorant I am. She know. Why should
you court here? There would always be as much to laugh at as there has
been to-day. Go where you need not laugh. This is not the place for
you. Good-by!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130638">Then he knew he need say no more. She<pb xml:id="fblouis_130637" n="83 'NOTHING HAS HURT YOU.'"/> spoke with a child's passion and with a woman's proud
obstinacy. Then she turned to Olivia. He was thrilled to the heart as
he watched her while she did it. Her eyes were full of tears, but she
had put both her hands behind her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130639">"Good-by," she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130640">Olivia broke down altogether.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130641">"Is that the way you are going to say good-by?" she cried. "I did
not think you were so hard. If I had meant any harm--but I didn't--and
you look as if you never would forgive me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130642">"I may some time," answered the girl. "I don't yet. I did not think
I was so hard, either."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130643">Her hands fell at her sides and she stood trembling a second. All
at once she had broken down, too.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130644">"I loved you," she said; "but you did not love me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130645">And then she turned away and walked slowly into the
house.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130646">It was almost half an hour before their host came to them with the
news that their carriage was ready.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130647">He looked rather "off color" himself and wore a wearied air, but he
was very uncommunicative.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130649">"Louisianny 'lowed she'd go to bed an' sleep<pb xml:id="fblouis_130648" n="84 LOUISIANA."/> off her headache, instead of goin' back to the Springs,"
he said. "I'll be thar in a day or two to 'tend to her bill an' the
rest on it. I 'low the waters haint done her much good. She aint at
herself rightly. I knowed she wasn't when she was so notionate this
evenin'. She aint notionate when she's at herself."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130650">"We are much indebted to you for your kindness," said Ferrol, when
he took the reins.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130651">"Oh, thet aint nothin'. You're welcome. You'd hev hed a better time
if Louisianny had been at herself. Good-by to ye. Ye'll hev plenty of
moonlight to see ye home."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130652">Their long ride was a silent one. When they reached the end of it
and Olivia had been helped out of the carriage and stood in the
moonlight upon the deserted gallery, where she had stood with
Louisiana in the morning, she looked very suitably miserable.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130653">"Laurence," she said, "I don't exactly see why you should feel so
very severe about it. I am sure I am as abject as any one could
wish."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130654">He stood a moment in silence looking absently out on the
moonlight-flooded lawn. Everything was still and wore an air of
desolation.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130655">"We won't talk about it," he said, at last, "but you have done me
an ill-turn, Olivia."</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130656" n="[85]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_019" n="9" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER IX.<lb/>"DON'T YE, LOUISIANNY?"</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130657">As he said it, Louisiana was at home in the house-room, sitting on
a low chair at her father's knee and looking into the fire. She had
not gone to bed. When he returned to the house her father had found
her sitting here, and she had not left her place since. A wood fire
had been lighted because the mountain air was cool after the rains,
and she seemed to like to sit and watch it and think.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130658">Mr. Rogers himself was in a thoughtful mood. After leaving his
departing guests he had settled down with some deliberation. He had
closed the doors and brought forward his favorite wooden-backed,
split-seated chair. Then he had seated himself, and drawing forth his
twist of tobacco had cut off a goodly "chaw." He moved slowly and wore
a serious and somewhat abstracted air. Afterward he tilted backward a
little, crossed his legs, and proceeded to ruminate.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130659" n="86 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130660">"Louisianny," he said, "Louisianny, I'd like to hear the rights of
it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130661">She answered him in a low voice.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130662">"It is not worth telling," she said. "It was a very poor joke,
after all."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130663">He gave her a quick side glance, rubbing his crossed legs slowly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130664">"Was it?" he remarked. "A poor one, after all? Why, thet's
bad."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130665">The quiet patience of his face was a study. He went on rubbing his
leg even more slowly than before.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130666">"Thet's bad," he said again. "Now, what d'ye think was the trouble,
Louisianny?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130667">"I made a mistake," she answered. "That was all."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130668">Suddenly she turned to him and laid her folder' arms on his knee
and her face upon them, sobbing.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130669">"I oughtn't to have gone," she cried. "I ought to have stayed at
home with you, father."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130670">His face flushed, and he was obliged to relieve his feelings by
expectorating into the fire.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130671">"Louisianny," he said, "I'd like to ask ye one question. Was thar
anybody thar as didn't--well, as didn't show ye respect--as was
slighty or free or--or onconsiderate? Fur instants, any littery
man--jest for instants, now?"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130672" n="87 'DON'T YE, LOUISIANNY?'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130673">"No, no!" she answered. "They were very kind to me always."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130674">"Don't be afeared to tell me, Louisianny," he put it to her. "I
only said 'fur instants,' havin' heern as littery men was

Louisianny, an' I haint much health--dispepsy's what tells on a man,"
he went on deliberately. "But if thar'd a bin any one as hed done it,
I'd hev hed to settle it with him--I'd hev hed to hev settled it with
him--liver or no liver."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130677">He put his hand on her head and gave it a slow little rub, the
wrong way, but tenderly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130678">"I aint goin' to ask ye no more questions," he said, "exceptin'
one. Is thar anything ye'd like to hev done in the house--in the
parlor, for instants, now--s'posin' we was to say in the parlor."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130679">"No, no," she cried. "Let it stay as it is! Let it all stay as it

tenderness. "Why shouldn't ye hev things if ye want 'em?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130682">"I don't want them," she protested. "I want nothing but you."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130683">For a moment there was a dead silence. He kept his eyes fixed on
the fire. He seemed to be turning something over in his mind. But at
last he spoke:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130684">"Don't ye, Louisianny?" he said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130685">"No," she answered. "Nothing."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130686">And she drew his hand under her cheek and kissed it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130687">He took it very quietly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130689">"Ye've got a kind heart, Louisianny," he said. "Young folks

as he had said before:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130697">"Don't ye, Louisianny?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130698">They sat silent again for some time afterward--indeed, but little
more was said until they separated for the night. Then, when she
kissed him and clung for a moment round his neck, he suddenly roused
himself from his prolonged reverie.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130699">"Lord!" he said, quite cheerfully, "it caynt last long, at the

hair from her forehead the wrong way again with a light touch, before
he let her go.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130704" n="[91]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_020" n="10" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER X.<lb/>THE GREAT WORLD.</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130705">THE next morning he went to the Springs.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130706">"I'll go an' settle up and bring ye your trunk an' things," he

to remain away from home during a night unless he had been compelled
to do so by business. He had always been too childishly fond of his
home to be happy away from it. He liked the routine he had been used
to through forty years, the rising at daylight, the regular common
duties he assumed as his share, his own seat on the hearth or porch
and at table.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130708">"Folks may be clever enough," he used to say. "They air clever, as

drove up and descended from his conveyence rather stiffly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130712">"Ye wasn't uneasy, was ye?" he asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130713">"No," she answered; "only it seemed strange to know you were
away."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130714">"I haint done it but three times since me an' Ianthy was married,"
he said. "Two o' them times was Conference to Barnsville, an' one was
when Marcelly died."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130715">When he mounted the porch steps he looked up at her with a smile on
his weather-beaten face.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130716">"Was ye lonesome?" he asked. "I bet ye was."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130717">"A little," she replied. "Not very."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130718">She gave him his chair against the wooden pillar, and watched him
as he tilted back and balanced himself on its back legs. She saw
something new and disturbed in his face and manner. It was as if the
bit of outside life he had seen had left temporary traces upon
him. She wondered very much how it had impressed him and what he was
thinking about.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130719" n="93 THE GREAT WORLD."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130720">And after a short time he told her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130721">"Ye must be lonesome," he said, "after stayin' down thar. It's
nat'ral. A body don't know until they see it theirselves. It's gay
thar. Lord, yes! it's gay, an' what suits young folks is to be gay."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130722">"Some of the people who were there did not think it was gay,"
Louisiana said, a little listlessly. "They were used to gayer places
and they often called it dull, but it seemed very gay to me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130723">"I shouldn't want it no gayer, myself," he returned, seriously:
"Not if I was young folks. Thar must hev bin three hundred on 'em in
thet thar dinin'-room. The names o' the vittles writ down on paper to
pick an' choose from, an' fifty or sixty waiters flyin' round. An' the
dressin'! I sot an' watched 'em as they come in. I sot an' watched 'em
all day. Thar was a heap o' cur'osities in the way of dressin' I never
seen before. I I went into the dancin'-room at night, too, an' sot
thar a spell an' watched 'em. They played a play. Some on 'em put
little caps an' aperns on, an' rosettes an' fixin's. They sorter
danced in it, an' they hed music while they was doin' it. It was
purty, too, if a body could hev follered it out."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130725">"It is a dance they call the German," said Lou<pb xml:id="fblouis_130724" n="94 LOUISIANA."/>isiana, remembering with a pang the first night she had
seen it, as she sat at her new friend's side.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130726">"German, is it?" he said, with evident satisfaction at making the
discovery. "Waal now, I ain't surprised. It hed a kinder Dutch look to
me--kinder Dutch an' furrin."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130727">Just then Nancy announced that his supper was ready, and he went
in, but on the threshold he stopped and spoke again:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130728">"Them folks as was here," he said, "they'd gone. They started the
next mornin' arter they was here. They live up North somewhars, an'
they've went thar."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130729">After he had gone in, Louisiana sat still for a little while. The
moon was rising and she watched it until it climbed above the
tree-tops and shone bright and clear. Then one desperate little sob
broke from her--only one, for she choked the next in its birth, and
got up and turned toward the house and the room in which the kerosene
lamp burned on the supper table.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130730">"I'll go an' talk to him," she said. "He likes to have me with him,
and it will be better than sitting here."</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130732">She went in and sat near him, resting her elbows<pb xml:id="fblouis_130731" n="95 THE GREAT WORLD."/> upon the table and her chin on her hands, and tried to
begin to talk. But it was not very easy. She found that she had a
tendency to fall back in long silent pauses, in which she simply
looked at him with sad, tender eyes.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130733">"I stopped at Casey's as I came on," he said, at last. "Thet thar
was one thing as made me late. Thar's--thar's somethin' I hed on my
mind fur him to do fur me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130734">"For Casey to do?" she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130735">He poured his coffee into his saucer and answered with a heavy
effort at speaking unconcernedly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130736">"I'm agoin' to hev him fix the house," he said. She was going to
ask him what he meant to have done, but he did not give her time.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130737">"Ianthy an' me," he said, "we'd useder say we'd do it sometime, an'
I'm agoin' to do it now. The rooms, now, they're low--whar they're not
to say small, they're low an'--an' old-timey. Thar aint no style to
'em. Them rooms to the Springs, now, they've got style to 'em. An'
rooms kin be altered easy enough."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130738">He drank his coffee slowly, set his saucer down and went on with
the same serious air of having broached an ordinary subject.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130740">"Goin' to the Springs has sorter started me<pb xml:id="fblouis_130739" n="96 LOUISIANA."/> off," he said. "Seein' things diff'rent does start a man
off. Casey an' his men'll be here Monday."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130741">"It seems so--sudden," Louisiana said. She gave a slow, wondering
glance at the old smoke-stained room. "I can hardly fancy it looking
any other way than this. It wont be the same place at all."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130742">He glanced around, too, with a start. His glance was hurried and
nervous.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130743">"Why, no," he said, "it wont, but--it'll be stylisher. It'll be
kinder onfamil'ar at first, but I dessay we shall get used to it--an'
it'll be stylisher. An' style--whar thar's young folks, thet's what's
wanted--style."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130744">She was so puzzled by his manner that she sat regarding him with
wonder. But he went on talking steadily about his plans until the meal
was over. He talked of them when they went back to the porch together
and sat in the moonlight. He scarcely gave her an opportunity to
speak. Once or twice the idea vaguely occurred to her that for some
reason he did not want her to talk. It was a relief to her only to be
called upon to listen, but still she was puzzled.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130746">"When we git fixed up," he said, "ye kin hev your friends
yere. Thar's them folks, now, as<pb xml:id="fblouis_130745" n="97 THE GREAT WORLD."/> was
yere the other day from the Springs--when we're fixed up ye mought
invite 'em--next summer, fur instants. Like as not I shall be away
myself an'--ye'd hev room a plenty. Ye wouldn't need me, ye see. An',
Lord! how it'd serprise 'em to come an' find ye all fixed."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130747">"I should never ask them," she cried, impetuously. "And--they
wouldn't come if I did."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130748">"Mebbe they would," he responded, gravely, "if ye was fixed
up."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130749">"I don't want them," she said, passionately. "Let them keep their
place. I don't want them."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130750">"Don't ye," he said, in his quiet voice. "Don't ye,
Louisianny?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130751">And he seemed to sink into a reverie and did not speak again for
quite a long time.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130752" n="[98]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_021" n="11" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER XI.<lb/>"A RUSTY NAIL."</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130753">ON Monday Casey and his men came. Louisiana and her father were at
breakfast when they struck their first blow at the end of the house
which was to be renovated first.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130754">The old man, hearing it, started violently--so violently that he
almost upset the coffee at his elbow.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130755">He laughed a tremulous sort of laugh.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130756">"Why, I'm narvous!" he said. "Now, jest to think o' me a-bein'
narvous!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130757">"I suppose," said Louisiana, "I am nervous as well. It made me
start too. It had such a strange sound."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130758">"Waal, now," he answered, "come to think on it, it
hed--sorter. Seems like it wasn't sca'cely nat'ral. P'r'aps that's
it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130760">Neither of them ate much breakfast, and when the meal was over they
went out together to look<pb xml:id="fblouis_130759" n="99 A RUSTY NAIL."/> at the
workmen. They were very busy tearing off weather-boarding and
wrenching out nails. Louisiana watched them with regretful eyes. In
secret she was wishing that the low ceilings and painted walls might
remain as they were. She had known them so long.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130761">"I am afraid he is doing it to please me," she thought. "He does
not believe me when I say I don't want it altered. He would never have
had it done for himself."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130762">Her father had seated himself on a pile of plank. He was rubbing
his crossed leg as usual, but his hand trembled slightly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130763">"I druv them nails in myself," he said. " Ianthy wasn't but
nineteen. She'd set yere an' watch me. It was two or three months

and smiled.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130765">"Ye aint in the notion o' hevin' the cupoly," he said. "We kin hev

"But ye
will when it gits along kinder. Lord! we'll be as impatient as Ianthy
an' me was, when it gits along."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130770">She tried to think she would, but without very much success. She
lingered about for a while, and at last went to her own room at the
other end of the house and shut herself in.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130771">Her trunk had been carried upstairs and set in its old place behind
the door. She opened it and began to drag out the dresses and other
adornments she had taken with her to the Springs. There was the blue
muslin. She threw it on the floor and dropped beside it, half sitting,
half kneeling. She laughed quite savagely.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130772">"I thought it was very nice when I made it," she said. "I wonder
how <hi rend="italic">she</hi> would like to wear it?" She pulled out
one thing after another until the floor around her was strewn. Then
she got up and left them, and ran to the bed and threw herself into a
chair beside it, hiding her face in the pillow.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130773">'Oh, how dull it is, and how lonely!" she said. "What shall I do?
What shall I do?"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130774" n="101 A RUSTY NAIL."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130775">And while she sobbed she heard the blows upon the boards below.
Before she went down-stairs she replaced the things she had taken from
the trunk. She packed them away neatly, and, having done it, turned
the key upon them.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130776">"Father," she said, at dinner, "there are some things upstairs I
want to send to Cousin Jenny. I have done with them, and I think she'd
like to have them."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130777">"Dresses an' things, Louisianny?" he said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130778">"Yes," she answered. "I shall not need them any more. I--don't care
for them."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130779">"Don't--" he began, but stopped short, and, lifting his glass,
swallowed the rest of the sentence in a large glass of milk.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130780">"I'll tell Leander to send fer it," he said afterward. "Jenny'll be
real sot up, I reckon. Her pappy bein' so onfort'nit, she don't git
much."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130782">He ate scarcely more dinner than breakfast, and spent the afternoon
in wandering here and there among the workmen. Sometimes he talked to
them, and sometimes sat on his pile of plank and watched them in
silence. Once, when no one was looking, he stooped down and picked up
a rusty nail which had fallen from its place in a piece of
board. After holding it in his hand for a little he<pb xml:id="fblouis_130781" n="102 LOUISIANA."/> furtively thrust it into his pocket, and seemed to
experience a sense of relief after he had done it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130783">"Ye don't do nothin' toward helpin' us, Uncle Elbert," said one of
the young men. (Every youngster within ten miles knew him as "Uncle
Elbert.") "Ye aint as smart as ye was when last ye built, air ye?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130784">"No, boys," he answered, "I ain't. Thet's so. I aint as smart,

at what ye're doin' now. Not as I don't think it's time it was done,
but--it'd sorter go ag'in me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130785">When Louisiana entered the house-room at dusk, she found him
sitting by the fire, his body drooping forward, his head resting
listlessly on his hand.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130786">"I've got a touch o' dyspepsy, Louisianny," he said, "an' the

the first few days that perhaps she had not been so quick to see as
she would otherwise have been, but the time soon came when she
awakened to a bewildered sense of new and strange trouble. She
scarcely knew when it was that she first began to fancy that some
change had taken place in her father. It was a change she could not
comprehend when she recognized its presence. It was no alteration of
his old, slow, quiet faithfulness to her. He had never been so
faithfully tender. The first thing which awakened her thought of
change was his redoubled tenderness. She found that he watched her
constantly, in a patient, anxious way. When they were together she
often discovered that he kept his eyes fixed upon her when he thought
she was not aware of his gaze. He seemed reluctant to leave her<pb xml:id="fblouis_130788" n="104 LOUISIANA."/> alone, and continually managed to be near
her, and yet it grew upon her at last that the old, homely
good-fellowship between them had somehow been broken in upon, and
existed no longer. It was not that he loved her any less--she was sure
of that; but she had lost something, without knowing when or how she
had lost it, or even exactly what it was. But his anxiety to please
her grew day by day. He hurried the men who were at work upon the
house.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130790">"Louisianny, she'll enjoy it when it's done," he said to
them. "hurry up, boys, an' do yer plum best."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130791">She had been at home about two weeks when be began to drive over to
the nearest depot every day at "train time." It was about three miles
distant, and he went over for several days in his spring wagon. At
first he said nothing of his reason for making the journey, but one
morning, as he stood at his horses' heads, he said to Louisiana,
without turning to look at her, and affecting to be very busy with
some portion of the harness:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130792">"I've ben expectin' of some things fer a day or so, an' they haint
come. I wasn't sure when I oughter to look fer 'em--mebbe I've ben
lookin' too soon--fer they haint come yet."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130793">"Where were they to come from?" she asked.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130794" n="105 'MEBBE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130795">"From--from New York City."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130796">"From New York?" she echoed, trying to show an interest. "I did not
know you sent there, father."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130797">"I haint never done it afore," he answered. " These yere
things--mebbe they'll come to-day, an' then ye'll see 'em."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130798">She asked no further questions, fancying that he had been buying
some adornments for the new rooms which were to be a surprise for
her. After he had gone away she thought a little sadly of his kindness
to her, and her unworthiness of it. At noon he came back and brought
his prize with him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130799">He drove up slowly with it behind him in the wagon--a large,
shining, new trunk--quite as big and ponderous as any she had seen at
the Springs.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130800">He got down and came up to her as she stood on the porch. He put
his hand on her shoulder.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130801">"I'll hev 'em took in an' ye kin look at 'em," he said. "It's some
new things ye was a-needin."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130803">She began to guess dimly at what he meant, but she followed the
trunk into the house without speaking. When they set it down she stood
near while her father fumbled for the key and<pb xml:id="fblouis_130802" n="106 LOUISIANA."/> found it, turned it in the lock and threw back the
lid.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130804">"They're some things ye was a-needin'," he said. "I hope ye'll like
'em, honey."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130805">She did not know what it was in his voice, or his face, or his
simple manner that moved her so, but she did not look at what he had
brought at all--she ran to him and caught his arm, dropped her face on
it, and burst into tears.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130806">"Father--father!" she cried. "Oh, father!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130807">"Look at 'em, Louisianny," he persisted, gently, "an' see if they
suit ye. Thar aint no reason to cry, honey."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130808">The words checked her and made her feel uncertain and bewildered
again. She stopped crying and looked up at him, wondering if her
emotion troubled him, but he did not meet her eye, and only seemed
anxious that she should see what he had brought.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130810">"I didn't tell ye all I hed in my mind when I went to the Springs,"
he said. "I hed a notion I'd like to see fer myself how things was. I
knowed ye'd hev an idee thet ye couldn't ask me fer the kind o' things

a-talkin'. She hed on a dress that took my fancy. It was mighty black
an' thick--ye know it was cold after the rains--an' when we was
talkin' I asked her if she mind a-tellin' me the name of it an' whar
she'd bought it. An' she laughed some, an' said it was velvet, an'
she'd got it to some store in New York City. An' I asked her if she'd
write it down; I'd a little gal at home I wanted a dress off'n it
fer--an' then, someways, we warmed up, an' I ses to her, 'She aint
like me. If ye could see her ye'd never guess we was kin.' She hadn't
never seen ye. She come the night ye left, but when I told her more
about ye, she ses, 'I think I've heern on her. I heern she was very
pretty.' An' I told her what I'd hed in my mind, an' it seemed like it
took her fancy, an' she told me to get a paper an' pencil an' she'd
tell me what to send fer an' whar to send. An' I sent fer 'em, an'

wear. She looked at the rolls of silk and the laces and feminine
extras with a bewildered feeling.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130812">"They are beautiful things,she said. "I never thought of having
such things for my own."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130813" n="108 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130814">"Thar's no reason why ye shouldn't hev 'em," he said. "I'd oughter

answered. "They are only too beautiful for--a girl like me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130816">"They cayn't be that," he said, gravely. "I didn't see none no
handsomer than you to the Springs, Louisianny, an' I ses to the lady

the best on 'em hev. I don't want nothin' no less than what she'd like
to hev if she'd ben raised in New York or Philadelphy City. Thar aint
no reason why she shouldn't hev it. Out of eleven she's all that's
left, an' she desarves it all. She's young an' handsome, and she
desarves it all.'"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130817">"What did she say to that?" Louisiana asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130818">He hesitated a moment before answering.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130819">"She looked at me kinder queer fer a minnit," he replied at
length. "An' then she ses, 'She'd oughter be a very happy gal,' ses
she, 'with such a father,' an' I ses, 'I 'low she is--mebbe.'"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130820">"Only maybe?" said the girl, "only maybe, father?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130822">She dropped the roll of silk she had been holding and went to
him. She put her hand on his<pb xml:id="fblouis_130821" n="109 'MEBBE.'"/> arm again and
shook it a little, laughing in the same feverish fashion as when she
had gone out to him on the porch on the day of her return. She had
suddenly flushed up, and her eyes shone as he had seen them then.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130823">"Only maybe," she said. "Why should I be unhappy? There's no
reason. Look at me, with my fine house and my new things! There isn't
any one happier in the world! There is nothing left for me to wish
for. I have got too much!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130824">A new mood seemed to have taken possession of her all at once. She
scarcely gave him a chance to speak. She drew him to the trunk's side,
and made him stand near while she took the things out one by one. She
exclaimed and laughed over them as she drew them forth. She held the
dress materials up to her waist and neck to see how the colors became
her; she tried on laces and sacques and furbelows and the hats which
were said to have come from Paris.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130825">"What will they say when they see me at meeting in them?" she
said. "Brother Horner will forget his sermons. There never were such
things in Bowersville before. I am almost afraid they will think I am
putting on airs."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130826" n="110 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130827">When she reached a box of long kid gloves at the bottom, she burst
into such a shrill laugh that her father was startled. There was a
tone of false exhilaration about her which was not what he had
expected.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130828">"See!" she cried, holding one of the longest pairs up, "eighteen
buttons! And cream color! I can wear them with the cream-colored silk
and cashmere at--at a festival!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130829">When she had looked at everything, the rag carpet was strewn with
her riches--with fashionable dress materials, with rich and delicate
colors, with a hundred feminine and pretty whims.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130830">"How could I help but be happy?" she said. "I am like a queen. I
don't suppose queens have very much more, though we don't know much

excited way.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130832">"You good old father!" she said, "you sweet old father!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130833">He took one of her soft, supple hands and held it between both his
brown and horny ones.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130834">"Louisianny," he said, "I <hi rend="italic">'low</hi> to make ye

rights; but when he had gone and closed the door, she did not touch
them. She threw herself down flat upon the floor in the midst of them,
her slender arms flung out, her eyes wide open and wild and
dry.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_130837" n="[112]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_023" n="13" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER XIII.<lb/>A NEW PLAN.</head><p xml:id="fblouis_130839">AT last the day came when the house was finished and stood big and
freshly painted and bare in the sun. Late one afternoon in the Indian
summer, Casey and his men, having bestowed their last touches,
collected their belongings and went away, leaving it a lasting
monument to their ability. Inside, instead of the low ceilings, and
painted wooden walls, there were high rooms and plaster and modern
papering; outside, instead of the variegated piazza, was a substantial
portico. The whole had been painted a warm gray, and Casey considered
his job a neat one and was proud of it. When they were all gone
Louisiana went out into the front yard to look at it. She stood in the
grass and leaned against an apple-tree. It was near sunset, and both
trees and grass were touched with a yellow glow so deep and mellow
that it was almost a golden haze. Now that the<pb xml:id="fblouis_130838" n="113 A NEW PLAN."/> long-continued hammering and sawing was at an end and all
traces of its accompaniments removed, the stillness seemed
intense. There was not a breath of wind stirring, or the piping of a
bird to be heard. The girl clasped her slender arms about the tree's
trunk and rested her cheek against the rough bark. She looked up
piteously.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130840">"I must try to get used to it," she said. "It is very much
nicer--and I must try to get used to it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130841">But the strangeness of it was very hard on her at first. When she
looked at it she had a startled feeling--as if when she had expected
to see an old friend she had found herself suddenly face to face with
a stranger.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130842">Her father had gone to Bowersville early in the day, and she had
been expecting his return for an hour or so. She left her place by the
tree at length and went to the fence to watch for his coming down the
road. But she waited in vain so long that she got tired again and
wandered back to the house and around to the back to where a new barn
and stable had been built, painted and ornamented in accordance with
the most novel designs. There was no other such barn or stable in the
country, and their fame was already wide-spread and of an enviable
nature.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130843" n="114 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130844">As she approached these buildings Louisiana glanced up and uttered
an exclamation. Her father was sitting upon the door-sill of the barn,
and his horse was turned loose to graze upon the grass before him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130845">"Father," the girl cried, "I have been waiting for you. I thought
you had not come."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130846">"I've been yere a right smart while, Louisianny," he answered. "Ye
wasn't 'round when I come, an' so ye didn't see me, I reckon."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130847">He was pale, and spoke at first heavily and as if with an effort,
but almost instantly he brightened.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130848">"I've jest ben a-settin' yere a-steddyin'," he said. "A man wants
to see it a few times an' take it sorter gradual afore he kin do it

hand toward the improvements, "ye kin see how much style thar is to

again, though he kept up a stout air of good cheer.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130853">"Lord!" he said, after a little pause, "it's a heap stylisher!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130854">Presently he bent down and picked up a twig which lay on the ground
at his feet. He began to strip the leaves from it with careful
slowness, and he kept his eyes fixed on it as he went on talking.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130855">"Ye'll never guess who I've ben a-talkin' to to-day, an' what I've
ben talkin' to 'em about."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130856">She put her hand on his knee caressingly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130857">"Tell me, father," she said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130858">He laughed a jerky, high-pitched laugh.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130859">"I've ben talkin' to Jedge Powers," he said.

Europe. He was mighty sosherble--an' he said they was a-goin' to
Europe."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130860">He had stripped the last leaf from the twig and had begun upon the
bark. Just at this juncture it slipped from his hand and fell on the
ground. He bent down again to pick it up.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130861" n="116 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130862">"Louisianny," he said, "how--would ye like to go to Europe?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130863">She started back amazed, but she could not catch even a glimpse of
his face, he was so busy with the twig.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130864">"I go to Europe--I!" she said. " I don't--I never thought of it. It
is not people like us who go to Europe, father."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130866">"Louisianny," he said, hurriedly, "what's agin it? Thar aint

ses to myself, 'Why, here's the very thing fer Louisianny! Travel an'
furrin langwidges an' new ways o' doin'. It's what she'd oughter hed

Europe? Let her go with my wife. She'll take care of her.' An' I

he. 'Why not? My wife an' daughter hev talked about her many a time,
an' said how they'd like to see her agin. Send her,' ses he. 'You're a

"when I set yere afore ye come."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130869">She had been sitting beside him, and she sprang to her feet and
stood before him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130870">"Father," she cried, "are you tired of me?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130871">"Tired of ye, Louisianny?" he repeated. "Tired of ye?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130872">She flung out her hand with a wild gesture and burst into
tears.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130873">"Are you tired of me?" she said again. "Don't you love me any more?
Don't you want me as you used to? Could you do without me for months
and months and know I was far away and couldn't come to you ? No, you
couldn't. You couldn't. I know that, though something--I don't know
what--has come between us, and I feel it every minute, and most when
you are kindest. Is there nothing in the way of my going
away--nothing? Think again."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130874">"Louisianny," he answered, "I cayn't think of nothin'--thet's
partic'lar."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130876">She slipped down on her knee and threw herself<pb xml:id="fblouis_130875" n="118 LOUISIANA."/> on his breast, clinging to him with all her young
strength.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130877">"Are you nothing?" she cried. "Is all your love nothing? Are all
your beautiful, good thoughts for my happiness 'nothing'? Is your
loneliness nothing? Shall I leave you here to live by yourself in the
new home which is strange to you--after you have given up the old one
you knew and loved for me? Oh! what has made you think I have no
heart, and no soul, and nothing to be grateful with? Have I ever been
bad and cruel and hard to you that you can think it?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130878">She poured forth her love and grief and tender reproach on his
breast with such innocent fervor that he could scarcely bear it. His
eyes were wet too, and his furrowed, sunburnt cheeks, and his breath
came short and fast while he held her close in his arms.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130880">"Honey," he said, just as he had often spoken to her when she had
been a little child, "Louisianny, honey, no! No, never! I never hed a

no! Thar aint nothin' ye've never dune in yer life that was meant to

so much finer. Ye mustn't be so tender-hearted, honey, ye
mustn't."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130881">She clung more closely to him and cried afresh, though more
softly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130882">"Nothing shall take me away from you," she said, "ever again. I
went away once, and it would have been better if I had stayed at
home. The people did not want me. They meant to be good to me, and
they liked me, but--they hurt me without knowing it, and it would have
been better if I had stayed here. <hi rend="italic">You</hi> don't

soothing her as best he could. Somehow he looked a little brighter
himself, and not quite so pale as he had done when she found him
sitting alone trying to do the new house "jestice."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130885">When at length they went in to supper it was<pb xml:id="fblouis_130884" n="120 LOUISIANA."/> almost dusk, and he had his arm still around her. he did

rest her head upon his knee.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130888">"It's almost like old times," she said. "Let us pretend I never
went away and that everything is as it used to be."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130889">"Would ye like it to be thataway, Louisianny?" he asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130890">She was going to say "Yes," but she remembered the changes he had
made to please her, and she turned her face and kissed the hand her
cheek rested against.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130892">"You mustn't fancy I don't think the new house is beautiful," she
said. "It isn't that I mean. What I would like to bring back is--is
the feeling I used to have. That is all--nothing but the old
feeling. And people can't always have the same<pb xml:id="fblouis_130891" n="122 LOUISIANA."/> feelings, can they? Things change so as we get
older."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130893">He looked at the crackling fire very hard for a minute.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130894">"Thet's so," he said. "Thet's so. Things changes in gin'ral, an'

she could scarcely bear to look at his face as the firelight shone on
it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130914">So, when she had bidden him good-night at last and walked to the

I hated myself and everything, and was ashamed that I had been
content. When I told you I wanted to play a joke on the people who
came here, it was not true. I wanted them to go away without knowing
that this was my home. It was only a queer place, to be laughed at, to
them, and I was ashamed of it, and bitter and angry. When they went
into the parlor they laughed at it and at the pictures, and everything
in it, and I stood by with my cheeks burning. When I saw a strange
woman in the kitchen it flashed into my mind that I had no need to
tell them that all these things that they laughed at had been round me
all my life. They were not sneering at them--it was worse than
that--they were only interested and amused and curious, and were not
afraid to let me see. The--gentleman had been led by his sister to
think I came from some city. He thought I was--was pretty and

seemed as if I was on fire. And I told them the truth--that you were

trembling. It seemed as if he meant to try to speak, but could
not. Then his eyes fell with an humble, bewildered, questioning glance
upon his feet, encased in their large, substantial brogans--the feet
she had said she was not worthy to kiss. What he saw in them to touch
him so it would be hard to tell--for he broke down utterly, put out
his hand, groping to feel for his chair, fell into it with head bowed
on his arm, and burst into sobbing too.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130931">She left her self-imposed exile in an instant, ran to him, and
knelt down to lean against him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130932">"Oh!" she cried, "have I broken your heart? Have I broken your

her head up to his breast and, with all the love and tenderness he had
lavished upon her all her life, she had never known such love and tenderness as he expressed in this one movement.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130934">"Louisianny," he said, brokenly, when he had found his voice, "it's

their trouble over simply and confidingly, holding nothing back.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130951">"When ye told me, Louisianny," said her father, "that ye wanted

She
awakened suddenly and found herself listening to the singing of a bird
on the tree near her window. Its singing was so loud and shrill that
it overpowered her and aroused her to a consciousness of fatigue and
exhaustion.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130959">It seemed to her at first that no one was stirring in the house
below, but after a few minutes she heard some one talking in her
father's room--talking rapidly in monotonous tone.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130960">"I wonder who it is," she said, and lay back upon her pillow,
feeling tired out and bewildered between the bird's shrill song and
the strange voice.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130961">And then she heard heavy feet on the stairs and listened to them
nervously until they reached her door and the door was pushed open
unceremoniously.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130962" n="134 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130963">The negro woman Nancy thrust her head into the room.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130964">"Miss Louisianny, honey," she said.

over one shoulder and making her look even paler than she was.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130971">"Father!" she said. "He was quite well late last night. It was
after midnight when we went to bed, and he was well then."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130972">The woman began to fumble uneasily at the latch.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130973">"Don't ye git skeered, chile," she said. "Mebbe 'taint nothin'--but
seemed to me like--like he didn't know me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130974">Louisiana was out of bed, standing upon the floor and dressing
hurriedly.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130976">"He was well last night," she said, piteously.<pb xml:id="fblouis_130975" n="135 'IANTHY.'"/> "Only a few hours ago. He was well and talked to me
and--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130977">She stopped suddenly to listen to the voice down-stairs--a new and
terrible thought flashing upon her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130978">"Who is with him?" she asked. "Who is talking to him?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130979">"Thar aint no one with him," was the answer. "He's by hisself,
honey."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130980">Louisiana was buttoning her wrapper at the throat. Such a tremor
fell upon her that she could not finish what she was doing. She left
the button unfastened and pushed past Nancy and ran swiftly down the
stairs, the woman following her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130981">The door of her father's room stood open and the fire Nancy had
lighted burned and crackled merrily. Mr. Rogers was lying high upon
his pillow, watching the blaze. His face was flushed and he had one
hand upon his chest. He turned his eyes slowly upon Louisiana as she
entered and for a second or so regarded her wonderingly. Then a change
came upon him, his face lighted up--it seemed as if he saw all at once
who had come to him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130982">"Ianthy!" he said. "I didn't sca'cely know ye! Ye've bin gone so
long! Whar hev ye bin?"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_130983" n="136 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_130984">But even then she could not realize the truth. It was so short a
time since he had bidden her good-night and kissed her at the
door.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130985">"Father!" she cried.	"It is Louisiana! Father, look at me!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130986">But he was looking at her, and yet he only smiled again.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130987">"It's bin such a long time, Ianthy," he said. "Sometimes I've
thought ye wouldn't never come back at all."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130988">And when she fell upon her knees at the bedside, with a desolate
cry of terror and anguish, he did not seem to hear it at all, but lay
fondling her bent head and smiling still, and saying happily:</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130989">"Lord! I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> glad to see ye!"</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fblouis_130990">When the doctor came--he was a mountaineer like the rest of them, a
rough good-natured fellow who had "read a course" with somebody and
"'tended lectures in Cincinnatty"--he could tell her easily enough
what the trouble was.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130992">"Pneumony," he said. "And pretty bad at that. He haint hed no
health fer a right smart while. He haint never got over thet spell he
hed last winter. This yere change in the weather's what's done it. He
was a-complainin' to me the<pb xml:id="fblouis_130991" n="137 'IANTHY.'"/> other day about
thet thar old pain in his chist. Things hes bin kinder 'cumylatin' on
him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130993">"He does not know me!" said Louisiana. "He is very ill--he is very
ill!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130994">Doctor Hankins looked at his patient for a moment, dubiously.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130995">"Wa-al, thet's so," he said, at length. "He's purty bad off--purty
bad!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130996">By night the house was full of visitors and volunteer nurses. The
fact that "Uncle Elbert Rogers was down with pneumony, an' Louisianny
thar without a soul anigh her" was enough to rouse sympathy and
curiosity. Aunt 'Mandy, Aunt Ca'line and Aunt 'Nervy came up one after
the other.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130997">"Louisianny now, she aint nothin' but a young thing, an' don't know
nothin'," they said. "An' Elbert bein' sich nigh kin, it'd look
powerful bad if we didn't go."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_130999">They came in wagons or ricketty buggies and brought their favorite
medicines and liniments with them in slab-sided, enamel-cloth
valises. They took the patient under their charge, applied their
nostrums and when they were not busy seemed to enjoy talking his
symptoms over in low tones. They were very good to Louisiana,
relieving her of every responsibility in spite of herself,<pb xml:id="fblouis_130998" n="138 LOUISIANA."/> and shaking their heads at each other
pityingly when her back was turned.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301000">"She never give him no trouble," they said. "She's got thet to hold
to. An' they was powerful sot on her, both him an' Ianthy. I've heern
'em say she allus was kinder tender an' easy to manage."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301001">Their husbands came to "sit up" with them at night, and sat by the
fire talking about their crops and the elections, and expectorating
with regularity into the ashes. They tried to persuade Louisiana to go
to bed, but she would not go.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301002">"Let me sit by him, if there is nothing else I can do," she
said. "If he should come to himself for a minute he would know me if I
was near him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301003">In his delirium he seemed to have gone back to a time before her
existence--the time when he was a young man and there was no one in
the new house he had built, but himself and "Ianthy." Sometimes he
fancied himself sitting by the fire on a winter's night and
congratulating himself upon being there.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301005">"Jest to think," he would say in a quiet, speculative voice, "that
two year ago I didn't know ye--an' thar ye air, a-sittin' sewin', and
the fire a-cracklin', an' the house all fixed. This yere's<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301004" n="139 'IANTHY!'"/> what I call solid comfort, Ianthy--jest solid
comfort!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301006">Once he wakened suddenly from a sleep and finding Louisiana bending
over him, drew her face down and kissed her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301007">"I didn't know ye was so nigh, Ianthy," he whispered. "Lord! jest
to think yer alleys nigh an' thar cayn't nothin' separate us."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301008">The desolateness of so living a life outside his, was so terrible
to the poor child who loved him, that at times she could not bear to
remain in the room, but would go out into the yard and ramble about
aimless and heart-broken, looking back now and then at the new,
strange house, with a wild pang.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301009">"There will be nothing left if he leaves me," she said. "There will
be nothing."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301010">And then she would hurry back, panting, and sit by him again, her
eyes fastened upon his unconscious face, watching its every shade of
expression and change.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301011">"She'll take it mighty hard," she heard Aunt Ca'line whisper one
day, "ef--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301012">And she put her hands to her ears and buried her face in the
pillow, that she might not hear the rest.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301013" n="[140]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_026" n="16" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER XVI.<lb/>"DON'T DO NO ONE A ONJESTICE."</head><p xml:id="fblouis_1301014">HE was not ill very long. Toward the end of the second week the
house was always full of visitors who came to sympathize and inquire
and prescribe, and who, in many cases, came from their farms miles
away attracted by the news that "Uncle Elbert Rogers" was "mighty bad
off." They came on horseback and in wagons or buggies--men in
homespun, and women in sunbonnets--and they hitched their horses at
the fence and came into the house with an awkwardly subdued air, and
stood in silence by the sick bed for a few minutes, and then rambled
towards the hearth and talked in spectral whispers.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301015">"The old man's purty low," they always said, "he's purty low." And
then they added among themselves that he had "allers bin mighty
clever, an' a good neighbor."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301017">When she heard them speak of him in this<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301016" n="141 'DON'T DO NO ONE A ONJESTICE.'"/> manner, Louisiana knew what it meant. She never
left the room again after the first day that they spoke so, and came
in bodies to look at him, and turn away and say that he had been good
to them. The men never spoke to her after their first nod of greeting,
and the women but rarely, but they often glanced hurriedly askance at
her as she sat or stood by the sick man's pillow. Somehow none of them
had felt as if they were on very familiar terms with her, though they
all spoke in a friendly way of her as being "a mighty purty, still,
kind o' a harmless young critter." They thought, when they saw her
pallor and the anguish in her eyes, that she was "takin' it powerful
hard, an' no wonder," but they knew nothing of her desperate
loneliness and terror.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301018">"Uncle Elbert he'll leave a plenty," they said in
undertones. "She'll be well pervided fer, will Louisianny."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301019">And they watched over their charge and nursed hirn faithfully,
feeling not a little sad themselves as they remembered his simple good
nature and neighborliness and the kindly prayers for which he had been
noted in "meetin'."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301021">On the last day of the second week the doctor held a consultation
with Aunt 'Nervy and Aunt Ca'line on the front porch before he went
away,<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301020" n="142 LOUISIANA."/> and when they re-entered the room
they spoke in whispers even lower than before and moved about
stealthily. The doctor himself rode away slowly and stopped at a house
or so on the wayside, where he had no patients, to tell the
inhabitants what he had told the head nurses.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301022">"We couldn't hev expected him to stay allers," he said, "but we'll
miss him mightily. He haint a enemy in the county--nary one!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301023">That afternoon when the sun was setting, the sick man wakened from
a long, deep sleep. The first thing he saw was the bright pale-yellow
of a tree out in the yard, which had changed color since he had seen
it last. It was a golden tree now as it stood in the sun, its leaves
rustling in a faint, chill wind. The next thing, he knew that there
were people in the room who sat silent and all looked at him with
kindly, even reverent, eyes. Then he turned a little and saw his
child, who bent towards him with dilated eyes and trembling, parted
lips. A strange, vague memory of weary pain and dragging, uncertain
days and nights came to him and he knew, and yet felt no fear.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301024">"Louisianny!" he said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301025">He could only speak in a whisper and tremulously. Those who sat
about him hushed their very breath.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301026" n="143 'DON'T DO NO ONE A ONJESTICE.'"/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301027">"Lay yer head--on the piller--nigh me," he said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301028">She laid it down and put her hand in his. The great tears were
streaming down her face, but she said not a word.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301029">"I haint got long--honey," he faltered. "The Lord--He'll keer--fer
ye."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301030">Then for a few minutes he lay breathing faintly, but with his eyes
open and smiling as they rested on the golden foliage of the tree.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301031">"How yaller--it is!" he whispered. "Like gold. Ianthy was
powerful--sot on it. It--kinder beckons."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301032">It seemed as if he could not move his eyes from it, and the pause
that followed was so long that Louisiana could bear it no longer, and
she lifted her head and kissed him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301033">"Father!" she cried.	"Say something to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>
Say something to <hi rend="italic">me!</hi>"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301034">It drew him back and he looked up into her eyes as she bent over

her no longer--nor the<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301036" n="144 LOUISIANA."/> people, nor the
room, but lay quite still with parted lips and eyes wide open, smiling
still at the golden tree waving and beckoning in the wind.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301038">This he saw last of all, and seemed still to see even when some one
came silently, though with tears, and laid a hand upon his
eyes.</p></div><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301039" n="[145]"/><div xml:id="fblouis_027" n="17" type="chapter"><head>CHAPTER XVII.<lb/>A LEAF.</head><p xml:id="fblouis_1301040">THERE was a sunny old grave-yard half a mile from the town, where
the people of Bowersville laid their dead under the long grass and
tangle of wild-creeping vines, and the whole country-side gathered
there when they lowered the old man into his place at his wife's
side. His neighbors sang his funeral hymn and performed the last
offices for him with kindly hands, and when they turned away and left
him there was not a man or woman of them who did not feel that they
had lost a friend.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301041">They were very good to Louisiana. Aunt 'Nervy and Aunt Ca'line
deserted their families that they might stay with her until all was
over, doing their best to give her comfort. It was Aunt 'Nervy who
first thought of sending for the girl cousin to whom the trunkful of
clothes had been given.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301042" n="146 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301043">"Le's send for Leander's Jenny, Ca'line," she said. "Mebbe it'd

the fifteen in an "onfort'nit" family she had adored and looked up to
Louisiana all her life. All the brightest days in her experience had
been spent at Uncle Elbert's with her favorite cousin. But there was
no brightness about the house now. When she arrived and was sent
upstairs to the pretty new room Louisiana occupied she found the girl
lying upon the bed. She looked white and slender in her black dress,
her hands were folded palm to palm under her check, and her eyes were
wide open.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301045">Jenny ran to her and knelt at her side. She kissed her and began to
cry.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301046">"Oh!" she sobbed, "somehow I didn't ever think I should come here
and not find Uncle Elbert. It don't seem right--it makes it like a
strange place."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301047">Then Louisiana broke into sobs, too.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301048">"It <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a strange place!" she cried--"a

that I could go into and not feel so lonely!"</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301049" n="147 A LEAF."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301050">But she had no sooner said it than she checked herself.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301051">"Oh, I oughtn't to say that!" she cried. "I wont say it. He did it
all for me, and I didn't deserve it."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301052">"Yes, you did," said Jenny, fondling her. "He was always saying
what a good child you had been--and that you had never given him any
trouble."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301053">"That was because he was so good," said Louisiana. "No one else in
the whole world was so good. And now he is gone, and I can never make
him know how grateful I was and how I loved him."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301054">"He did know," said Jenny.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301055">"No," returned Louisiana. "It would have taken a long, long life to
make him know all I felt, and now when I look back it seems as if we
had been together such a little while. Oh! I thought the last night we
talked that there was a long life before us--that I should be old
before he left me, and we should have had all those years
together."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301057">After the return from the grave -yard there was a prolonged
discussion held among the heads of the different branches of the
family. They gathered at one end of the back porch and talked of<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301056" n="148 LOUISIANA."/> Louisiana, who sat before the log fire in her
room upstairs.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301058">"She aint in the notion o' leavin' the place," said Aunt

Louisianny don't. She's a settled woman, an's bin married, an' haint
no family to pester her sence Nance is dead."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301062" n="149 A LEAF."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301063">"She was allers the through-goin' kind," said Aunt
'Nervy. "Things'll be well looked to--an' she thought a heap o'
Elbert. They was raised together."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301064">"S'pos'n ye was to go in an' speak to Louisianny," suggested Uncle
Steve.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301065">Louisiana, being spoken to, was very tractable. She was willing to
do anything asked of her but go away.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301066">"I should be very glad to have Mrs. Nance here, Aunt Minerva," she
said. "She was always very kind, and father liked her. It won't be
like having a strange face near me. Please tell her I want her to come
and that I hope she will try to feel as if she was at home."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301067">So Marthy Lureny Nance came, and was formally installed in her
position. She was a tall, strongly-built woman, with blue eyes, black
hair, and thick black eyebrows. She wore, when she arrived, her best
alpaca gown and a starched and frilled blue sun-bonnet. When she
presented herself to Louisiana she sat down before her, removed this
sun-bonnet with a scientific flap and hung it on the back of her
chair.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301068">"Ye look mighty peak-ed, Louisianny," she said. "Mighty
peak-ed."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301069" n="150 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301070">"I don't feel very well," Louisiana answered, "but I suppose I
shall be better after a while."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301071">"Ye're takin' it powerful hard, Louisianny," said Mrs. Nance, "an'
I don't blame ye. I aint gwine to pester ye a-talkin'. I jest come to
say I 'lowed to do my plum best by ye, an' ax ye whether ye liked hop
yeast or salt risin'?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301072">At the end of the week Louisiana and Mrs. Nance were left to
themselves. Aunt 'Nervy and Aunt Ca'line and the rest had returned to
their respective homes, even Jenny had gone back to Bowersville where
she boarded with a relation and went to school.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301074">The days after this seemed so long to Louisiana that she often
wondered how she lived through them. In the first passion of her
sorrow she had not known how they passed, but now that all was silence
and order in the house, and she was alone, she had nothing to do but
to count the hours. There was no work for her, no one came in and out
for whom she might invent some little labor of love; there was no one
to watch for, no one to think of. She used to sit for hours at her
window watching the leaves change their color day by day, and at last
flutter down upon the grass at the least stir of wind.<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301073" n="151 A LEAF."/> Once she went out and picked up one of these leaves and
taking it back to her room, shut it up in a book.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301075">"Everything has happened to me since the day it was first a leaf,"
she said. "I have lived just as long as a leaf. That isn't long."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301076">When the trees were bare, she one day remembered the books she had
sent for when at the Springs, and she went to the place where she had
put them, brought them out and tried to feel interested in them
again.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301077">"I might learn a great deal," she said, "if I persevered. I have so
much time."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301078">But she had not read many pages before the tears began to roll down
her checks.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301079">"If he had lived," she said, "I might have read them to him and it
would have pleased him so. I might have done it often if I had thought
less about myself. He would have learned, too. He thought he was slow,
but he would have learned, too, in a little while, and he would have
been so proud."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301080">She was very like her father in the simple tenderness of her
nature. She grieved with the hopeless passion of a child for the
unconscious wrong she had done.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301082">It was as she sat trying to fix her mind upon<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301081" n="152 LOUISIANA."/> these books that there came to her the first thought of
a plan which was afterwards of some vague comfort to her. She had all
the things which had furnished the old parlor taken into one of the
unused rooms--the chairs and tables, the carpet, the ornaments and
pictures. She spent a day in placing everything as she remembered it,
doing all without letting any one assist her. After it was arranged
she left the room, and locked the door taking the key with her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301083">"No one shall go in but myself," she said. "It belongs to me more
than all the rest."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301084">"I never knowed her to do nothin' notionate but thet," remarked
Mrs. Nance, in speaking of it afterwards. "She's mighty still, an'
sits an' grieves a heap, but she aint never notionate. Thet was kinder
notionate fer a gal to do. She sets store on 'em 'cos they was her
pappy's an' her ma's, I reckon. It cayn't be nothin' else, fur they
aint to say stylish, though they was allers good solid-appearin'
things. The picters was the on'y things es was showy."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301085">"She's mighty pale an' slender sence her pappy died," said the
listener.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301086">"Wa-al, yes, she's kinder peak-ed," admitted Mrs. Nance. "She's
kinder peak-ed, but she'll git over it. Young folks allers
does."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301087" n="153 A LEAF."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301088">But she did not get over it as soon as Mrs. Nance had expected, in
view of her youth. The days seemed longer and lonelier to her as the
winter advanced, though they were really so much shorter, and she had
at last been able to read and think of what she read. When the snow
was on the ground and she could not wander about the place she grew
paler still.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301089">"Louisianny," said Mrs. Nance, coming in upon her one day as she
stood at the window, "ye're a-beginnin' to look like ye're Aunt
Melissy."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301090">"Am I?" answered Louisiana. "She died when she was young, didn't
she?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301091">"She wasn't but nineteen," grimly. "She hed a kind o' love-scrape,
an' when the feller married Emmerline Ruggles she jest give right
in. They hed a quarrel, an' he was a sperrity kind o' thing an'
merried Emmerline when he was mad. He cut off his nose to spite his
face, an' a nice time he hed of it when it was done. Melissy was a
pretty gal, but kinder consumpshony, an' she hedn't backbone enough to
hold her up. She died eight or nine months after they'd
quarreled. Mebbe she'd hev died anyhow, but thet sorter hastened it
up. When folks is consumpshony it don't take much to set 'em
off."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301092" n="154 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301093">"I don't think I am 'consumpshony,'" said Louisiana.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301094">"Lord-a-massy, no!" briskly, "an' ye'd best not begin to think
it. I wasn't a meanin' thet. Ye've kinder got into a poor way
steddyin' 'bout yore pappy, an' it's tellin' on ye. Ye look as if thar
wasn't a thing of ye--an' ye don't take no int'russ. Ye'd oughter stir
round more."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301095">"I'm going to 'stir round' a little as soon as Jake brings the
buggy up," said Louisiana. "I'm going out."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301096">"Whar?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301097">"Toward town."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301098">For a moment Mrs. Nance looked at her charge steadily, but at
length her feelings were too much for her. She had been thinking this
matter over for some time.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301100">"Louisianny," she said, "you're a-gwine to the grave-yard, thet's
whar ye're a-gwine an' thar aint no sense in it. Young folks hedn't
ought to hold on to trouble thataway--'taint nat'ral. They don't
gin'rally. Elbert 'd be ag'in it himself ef he knowed--an' I s'pose he
does. Like as not him an' Ianthy's a-worryin' about it now, an' Lord
knows ef they air it'll spile all their enjoyment. Kingdom come won't
be nothin' to 'em if they're oneasy in their minds 'bout ye. Now an'
ag'in it's<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301099" n="155 A LEAF."/> 'peared to me that mebbe harps an'
crowns an' the company o' 'postles don't set a body up all in a minnit
an' make 'em forgit their flesh an' blood an' nat'ral feelin's
teetotally--an' it kinder troubles me to think o' Elbert an' Ianthy
worryin' an' not havin' no pleasure. Seems to me ef I was you I'd
think it over an' try to cheer up an' take int'russ. Jest think how
keerful yer pappy an' ma was on ye an' how sot they was on hevin' ye
well an' happy."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301101">Louisiana turned toward her. Her eyes were full of tears.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301102">"Oh!" she whispered, "do you--do you think they know?"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301103">Mrs. Nance was scandalized.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301104">"Know!" she echoed. "Wa-al now, Louisianny, ef I didn't know yer
raisin', an' thet ye'd been brought up with members all yer life, it'd
go ag'in me powerful to hear ye talk thetaway. Ye <hi rend="italic">know</hi> they know, an' thet they'll take it hard, ef
they aint changed mightily, but, changed or not, I guess thar's mighty
few sperrits es haint sense enough to see yer a-grievin' more an'
longer than's good fur ye."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301106">Louisiana turned to her window again. She rested her forehead
against the frame-work and<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301105" n="156 LOUISIANA."/> looked out for
a little while. But at last she spoke.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301107">"Perhaps you are right," she said. "It is true it would have hurt
them when they were here. I think--I'll try to--to be happier."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301108">"It's what'll please 'em best, if ye do, Louisianny," commented
Mrs. Nance.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301109">"I'll try," Louisiana answered. "I will go out now--the cold air
will do me good, and when I come back you will see that I
am--better."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301110">"Wa-al," advised Mrs. Nance, "ef ye go, mind ye put on a
plenty--an' don't stay long."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301111">The excellent woman stood on the porch when the buggy was brought
up, and having tucked the girl's wraps round her, watched her driven
away.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301112">"Mebbe me a-speakin's I did'll help her," she said. "Seems like it
kinder teched her an' sot her thinkin'. She was dretfle fond of her
pappy an' she was allers a purty peaceable advise-takin' little

gate he bent forward to look at something.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301115">"Thar's a critter hitched to the fence," he remarked. "'Taint no
critter from round yere. I never seen it afore."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301116">Mrs. Nance came out upon the porch to meet them. She was gently
excited by an announcement she had to make.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301117">"Louisianny," she said, "thar's a man in the settin'-room. He's
a-waitin' to see ye. I asked him of he hed anything to sell, an' he
sed no he hedn't nothin', He's purty <hi rend="italic">gen</hi>-teel
an' stylish, but not to say showy, an' he's polite sort o'
manners."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301118">"Has he been waiting long?" Louisiana asked.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301119">"He's ben thar half a hour, an' I've hed the fire made up sence he
come."</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301120" n="158 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301121">Louisiana removed her hat and cloak and gave them to
Mrs. Nance. She did it rather slowly, and having done it, crossed the
hall to the sitting-room door, opened it and went in.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301122">There was no light in the room but the light of the wood fire, but
that was very bright. It was so bright that she had not taken two
steps into the room before she saw clearly the face of the man who
waited for her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301123">It was Laurence Ferrol.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301124">She stopped short and her hands fell at her sides. Her heart beat
so fast that she could not speak.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301125">His heart beat fast, too, and it beat faster still when he noted
her black dress and saw how pale and slight she looked in it. He
advanced towards her and taking her hand in both his, led her to a
chair.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301126">"I have startled you too much," he said. "Don't make me feel that I
was wrong to come. Don't be angry with me."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301127">She let him seat her in the chair and then he stood before her and
waited for her to speak.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301128">"It was rather--sudden," she said, "but I am not--angry."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301130">There was a silence of a few seconds, because he was so moved by
the new look her face wore<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301129" n="159 'HE KNEW THAT I LOVED YOU.'"/> that he could not easily command his voice and words.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301131">"Have you been ill?" he asked gently, at last.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301132">He saw that she made an effort to control herself and answer him
quietly, but before she spoke she gave up even the effort. She did not
try to conceal or wipe away the great tears that fell down her cheeks
as she looked up at him.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301133">"No, I have not been ill," she said. "My father is dead."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301134">And as she uttered the last words her voice sank almost into a
whisper.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301135">Just for a breath's space they looked at each other and then she
turned in her chair, laid her arm on the top of it and her face on her
arm, with a simple helpless movement.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301136">"He has been dead three months," she whispered, weeping.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301137">His own eyes were dim as he watched her. He had not heard of this
before. He walked to the other end of the room and back again
twice. When he neared her the last time he stopped.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301138">"Must I go away?" he asked unsteadily. "I feel as if I had no right
here."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301139">But she did not tell him whether he must go or stay.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301140" n="160 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301141">"If I stay I must tell you why I came and why I could not remain
away," he said.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301142">She still drooped against her chair and did not speak, and he drew
still nearer to her.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301143">"It does not seem the right time," he said, "but I must tell you
even if I go away at once afterwards. I have never been happy an hour
since we parted that wretched day. I have never ceased to think of
what I had begun to hope for. I felt that it was useless to ask for it
then--I feel as if it was useless now, but I must ask for it. Oh!"
desperately, "how miserably I am saying it all! How weak it
sounds!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301144">In an instant he was kneeling on one knee at her side and had
caught her hand and held it between both his own.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301145">"I'll say the simplest thing," he said. "I love you. Everything is
against me, but I love you and I am sure I shall never love another
woman."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301146">He clasped her hand close and she did not draw it away.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301147">"Won't you say a word to me?" he asked. "If you only tell me that
this is the wrong time and that I must go away now, it will be better
than some things you might say."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301148">She raised her face and let him see it.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301150">"No," she said, "it is not that it is the wrong<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301149" n="161 'HE KNEW THAT I LOVED YOU.'"/> time. It is a better time than any other,
because I am so lonely and nay trouble has made my heart softer than
it was when I blamed you so. It is not that it is the wrong time,
but--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301151">"Wait a minute," he broke in. "Don't--don't do me an
injustice!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301152">He could not have said anything else so likely to reach her
heart. She remembered the last faltering words she had heard as she
bent over the pillow when the sun was shining on the golden tree with
the wind waving its branches.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301153">"Don't do no one a onjestice, honey--don't ye--do no one--a
onjestice."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301154">"Oh," she cried out, "he told me that I must not--he told me,
before he died!"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301155">"What!" said Ferrol. "He told you not to be unjust to <hi rend="italic">me?</hi>"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301156">"It was you he meant," she answered. "He knew I had been hard to
you--and he knew I--"</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301157">She cowered down a little and Ferrol folded her in his arms.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301158">"Don't be hard to me again," he whispered. "I have been so
unhappy--I love you so tenderly. Did he know that you--speak to me,
Louise."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301159">She put her hand upon his shoulder.</p><pb xml:id="fblouis_1301160" n="162 LOUISIANA."/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301161">"He knew that I loved you," she said, with a little
sob.</p><milestone rend="blank-line" unit="section"/><p xml:id="fblouis_1301162">She was a great favorite among her husband's friends in New York
the next year. One of her chief attractions for them was that she was
a "new type." They said that of her invariably when they delighted in
her and told each other how gentle she was and how simple and
sweet. The artists made "studies" of her, and adored her, and were
enthusiastic over her beauty; while among the literary ones it was
said, again and again, what a foundation she would be for a heroine of
the order of those who love and suffer for love's sake and grow more
adorable through their pain.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301164">But these, of course, were only the delightful imaginings of art,
talked over among themselves, and Louisiana did not hear of them. She
was very happy and very busy. There was a gay joke current among them
that she was a most tremendous book-worm, and that her literary
knowledge was something for weak, ordinary mortals to quail
before. The story went, that by some magic process she committed to
memory the most appalling works half an hour after they were issued
from<pb xml:id="fblouis_1301163" n="163 'HE KNEW THAT I LOVED YOU.'"/> the press, and that,
secretly, Laurence stood very much in awe of her and was constantly
afraid of exposing his ignorance in her presence. It was certainly
true that she read a great deal, and showed a wonderful aptness and
memory, and that Laurence's pride and delight in her were the
strongest and tenderest feelings of his heart.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301165">Almost every summer they spent in North Carolina, filling their
house with those of their friends who would most enjoy the simple
quiet of the life they led. There were numberless pictures painted
among them at such times and numberless new "types" discovered.</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301166">"But you'd scarcely think," it was said sometimes, "that it is here
that Mrs. Laurence is on her native heath."</p><p xml:id="fblouis_1301167">And though all the rest of the house was open, there was one room
into which no one but Laurence and Louisiana ever went--a little room,
with strange, ugly furniture in it, and bright-colored lithographs
upon the walls.</p><trailer>END.</trailer></div></body><back xml:id="fblouis_1357"><div xml:id="fblouis_040" type="adverts"><figure><graphic url="fblouisbm1.jpg" rend="inline"/><figDesc>Advertisement included in the back of Burnett's
