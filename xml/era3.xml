Many of the agents interested in this Souvenir, are asking for a whole page upon which to show up the successful business people of their section, and all are taking a local pride in the result. As this number is to have handsome covers, and fine cuts, it will be a lasting ornament, as well as a good business Directory for future reference. All our business people failing to be in evidence in this triumphant showing of successful effort, will have cause for regret when too late to remedy. All orders for space <hi rend="italic">must be in the Boston office by July 10th</hi>, to insure insertion ill this great <hi rend="italic">free</hi> edition. Among the cuts promised is one of Harriet Tubman, of the latest statue presented to the city of Boston, that of John Boyle O'Riley, and in reception of which Mayor Quincy said, "it is the fittest piece of sculpture erected in all Boston," of the building where the first convention of women was held in Boston, and the church where the first annual meeting will be held in Washington, in July.</p></div><pb xml:id="era3_1304" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_21.02" type="Article"><head rend="center">STATEMENT TO ADVERTISERS.</head><p xml:id="era3_1305">The WOMAN'S ERA, now in its third year, is published monthly in Boston; it is the organ of the N.F. of A-A.W. which organization extends over a dozen states including fifty Clubs, whose united memberships reach far into the thousands.</p><p xml:id="era3_1306">At the first Annual Convention of this national organization to be held in Washington, D.

A few of the best novels were selected and studied carefully, the aim being not quantity but quality. Each member of the class was given a set of questions on the novel to be taken up, to which answers were to be formed according to one's opinion after careful reading. These questions and answers were afterwards discussed in the class. The chief benefit derived from the study was through this discussion and being able to form and hold one's own opinion . The questions used in this class will be presented to the readers of the "ERA" from time to time as an incentive to pleasant and profitable study. No answers will be given, for many can simply be a matter of personal opinion.</p><pb xml:id="era3_13022" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_21.05.01" type="Article"><head rend="center">THE STUDY OF THE NOVEL.<lb/>

FANNIE BARIER WILLIAMS IN BOSTON.</head><p xml:id="era3_13023">The long anticipated lecture by Mrs. Williams of Chicago was given at Gilbert Hall, Tremont Temple on June 20. Mrs. Williams lectured on "The Strength and Weakness of the Christian Religion as Believed, Preached and Practised in the United States" and spoke in her usual thoughtful and finished style. Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney presided and the lecture was listened to by a fine sized audience. Unfortunately the afternoon selected was the one upon which the closing exercises of the "Perkins Institute for the Blind" was held; as this is one of the pet institutions of Boston it drew away a large number who would otherwise have attended the lecture, among them Mrs. Julia Ward Howe who personally expressed her disappointment at not being able to hear Mrs. Williams. On this afternoon also, the Cantabrigia Club held open house in Cambridge in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of that city. All these kept away a large number who met Mrs. Williams and regretted the circumstances which deprived them of the pleasure of hearing her.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_21.07" type="Article"><head rend="center">ANNIVERSARY WEEK AND VISITORS.</head><p xml:id="era3_13024">The last week in May was a full and delightful one to Boston club women; the annual anniversaries which are a distinctive feature of New England life and work were carried on in the same quietly delightful way as usual, the intellectual features, were as ever faultless, the best minds in New England contributing to these occasions and, amid sunshine and flowers, music, wit, and beauty, yes <hi rend="italic">beauty</hi>, too, Anniversary Week of '96 took its place in the long line of anniversaries gone before.</p><p xml:id="era3_13025">The Woman's Era Club was fortunate in having in its midst, as guests of its president, Mrs Mathews of New York, Mrs. F.B. Williams of Chicago and Mrs. Dickerson of Newport. Each of the Iadies took part in one or more of the many intellectual gatherings of the week, Mrs. Williams being heard in a lecture in Tremont Temple, at one of' the suffrage meetings and at the Free Religious Banquet, where she and Mrs. Mathews were the guests of Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, while Mrs. Mathews was the speaker at a special called meeting in Charles St. Church, and at the Moral Educational Association meeting at Tremont Temple. All the visiting ladies were guests of Mrs. Ruffin at the Suffrage Banquet in Music Hall. Other social features were, the reception tendered the ladies by the Woman's Era Club at the house of the president. This was in every way a delightful success in spite of the throng which filled the house from chamber to basement, and overflowed on to the porch for air. There was some very fine vocal music by Mrs. A.C. Sparrow, musical director of the club, and recitations by Miss Florence Williams of Newton. The committee having the reception in charge took possession of the house early in the day and literally banked the parlors with potted plants, wild flowers and ferns. The following ladies served at the different tables: Mrs. E. Benjamin, ices and cake, Mrs. Bailey, lemonade and Mrs. Foster, frappe; Miss Eva Lewis, Mrs. Lottie Sampson, Mrs. Dandridge and Miss Etta Tolliver acted as ushers. Memorial day was spent in driving around beautiful Mt. Auburn visiting the tombs of distinguished dead. The last day the visitors were guests at the Cantabrigia Club Reception in the "Newtown Club House" and took part in the festivities consequent upon the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of Cambridge as a city.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_21.08" type="Filler"><p xml:id="era3_13026">The Ladies' Auxiliary, Mrs. B.

In attempting to do the work of the Federation and to adequately represent that body, the management took upon itself new and great responsibilities, and until the Federation has had its first convention and gets into better running order, everything concerned is necessarily more or less irregular. We know this condition is irritating but it is always one of the necessary <choice><corr> concomitants</corr><sic>concommittants</sic></choice> of young and struggling institutions. With the Federation well started, with the work running smoothly so that workers will not be "run to death" and then criticised because some things have been omitted, we hope to do better things. Until that time we ask that indulgence which we are obliged to exercise in large measure in doing what we can in carrying on this work for our women and our race.</p><p xml:id="era3_13030">Institutions like the Federation, papers like the ERA, not only call for self-sacrifice, devotion and enthusiasm on the part of those who conduct, but also a large charity, patience, and sympathy on the part of those who "stand and wait."</p><div xml:id="era3_21.09.01" type="Editorial"><head rend="center">WINNING CAUSES.</head><p xml:id="era3_13031">The causes or movements that have the elements of assured success *  *  *  belong to the history of the human race and not to a mere handful of people from a remote corner of the earth, and must be tested by three supreme tests: the test of right principle, the test of endurance, and the test of growth."</p></div><div xml:id="era3_21.09.02" type="Article"><head rend="center">THE CONVENTION OF THE N.F.A.-A.W.</head><p xml:id="era3_13032">That the Federation of colored women should have in one year grown to twice its original size, that it should awaken interest in, and receive responses from the women all over the country, speaks well, not only for the future of organized work among us, but also for the energy, intelligence and self-sacrifice of the officers.</p><p xml:id="era3_13033">The convention promises to be a remarkable one, not only for the characters of the women who will assemble and be represented, but also for the scope of the work which has been planned.</p><p xml:id="era3_13034">*      *      *      *      *      *  </p><p xml:id="era3_13035">The decision of the Supreme Court of the United States on the Separate Car Law, comes as a disappointment, but hardly as a surprise to millions of loyal American citizens.</p><p xml:id="era3_13036">It cannot be denied that sentiment against the Negro and his rights is growing rapidly. As the black man acquires money and education new barriers are raised against him, sometimes old obstacles which pity for helplessness and ignorance caused to be removed are being rebuilt and it is only to a few enlightened minds that the cause of the Negro has any interest at all.</p><p xml:id="era3_13037">In time the problem must work itself, and in the meantime the Negro has got to make himself felt. There is no wisdom, virtue, policy or manhood in bearing everything put upon one. Appeals for justice by voice and pen go very little ways at present, practically no attention whatever is paid to them; the time is come when they must be backed by aggressive action and a physical as well as mental resistance to every abrogation of manhood rights.</p><p xml:id="era3_13038">If laws are unjust, they must be continually broken until they are killed or altered. The thing to do is to force the recognition of manhood by any and all means.</p><p xml:id="era3_13039">The heroes of the South who are meeting cowardly lynchers with a shotgun and the courage of true manhood, the men of the North as well as the South who are meeting insinuations against character and efforts to humiliate them with a strong and ready fist, are doing as much towards the forcing of a right condition as any. The world is turning a callous ear to appeals for justice; it is evident that the only way now to get what we want is to take it even if we have to break laws in getting it.</p><p xml:id="era3_13040" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era3_13041">The need of Christian homes for wayward and erring girls, will be an issue.</p><p xml:id="era3_13042">The Separate Car law will be generally discussed and drastic measures adopted for having it expunged from the Statute of the states in which the system operates, it is hoped.</p><p xml:id="era3_13043">Delegates to the convention are assured of a hearty welcome by the pastor and people of the19th St. Baptist Church, where the session will be held.

Distinct lines of work should not be conflicted with causes for antagonism. We fear this has been done unwittingly by many who have not begun to realize the proportions of the Woman's Movement. We are rejoiced over the moral effect thus far of the efforts to arouse our women the country over. Until the movement inaugurated by the women of Boston, which resulted in the formation of the National Federation was pioneered to success, the colored woman as a factor in club life was unknown, except locally. Not so now, and the National Federation feels justifiably encouraged. At the coming Convention efforts will be made to accomplish tangible results by bringing together the women who have founded homes, orphanages and hospitals, that our coming women may gather inspiration and the public be educated as to the actual work our women are striving against odds to do.</p><p xml:id="era3_13070">Mrs. Tyree and Miss Chanie Patterson, Miss E.

Cordelia Ray, secretary of the W.L.U. There is something eminently fit in selecting these ladies to perform this pleasing task.

COM. OF N.F.A.-A.W.</head><docAuthor>Victoria Matthews</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_13081">Since the publication of the letters sent by the officers of the National League, many persons have written for information as to "why the National Federation refused to unite with National League?" and other questions implying that the officers of the National Federation were cognizant of the plans of the League to hold a separate convention before the announcement was made in public print. As my correspondence is <choice><corr>voluminous</corr><sic>voluminious</sic></choice>, and everything connected with this matter is not private but public concern, I am forced to adopt this means of answering many who have requested information concerning the matter. I beg all included under this head of personal correspondents will consider this explanation a personal reply to their queries: -- </p><p xml:id="era3_13082">The facts in the case are simply these. At no time did the officers of the National League notify or invite the National Federation to participate in its convention through any officer connected with The National Federation. The National Secretary, Mrs. F.R. Ridley, having never received any communication whatever. The only intimation Mrs. B. T. Washington had of the date or plans of the National League was from the announcement contained in <hi rend="italic">Colored American</hi> of April 25th. Mrs. Washington nor the Chairman of Executive Committee, was not notified that the League would not meet the Federation in Joint Convention. No notice of this important fact was sent to the official organ of the Federation. No invitation has been sent to the National Federation, to carry out the terms of the vote of the Conference committee, i.e. that a <hi rend="italic">joint convention</hi> be held this summer; a joint session and a joint convention, are two widely differing affairs; lastly the letter published in last issue of THE WOMAN'S ERA, is absolutely the last communication received by the Chairman of Executive Committee, from the officers of the National League. Our coming convention represents not a "difference" of any kind with the National League or any other body. It will be held in accordance with article V of the Constitution.</p><salute>Respectfully,</salute><signed><name>Victoria Matthews,</name><title>Chairman Executive Committee National Federation of Afro-American Women.</title></signed></div><div xml:id="era3_21.14" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">LOUISANA.</head><docAuthor>Alice Ruth Moore</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_13083">The Phyllis Wheatley Club is doing a lot of work lately. The Sanitarium scheme is taking on what seems to be something of a very definite nature. There was a special meeting to discuss its plans into something like real work.</p><p xml:id="era3_13084">The committee which was appointed to make reports and confer with the different authorities in charge of the Charity hospital relative to the establishing of a Phyllis Wheatley Ward therein, reported at the previous monthly meeting, that Dr. Lewis and Sister Agnes in charge of the Hospital work had stated most emphatically and plainly that under no circumstances whatever would colored physicians and nurses be allowed to practice in the Hospital, even under such conditions as the Club wished imposed. Under such circumstances there was nothing for the P.W.C.'s to do but withdraw their offer of endowing the ward, and turn their attention to other matters.</p><p xml:id="era3_13085">At this juncture, the committee conferred with Dr. Atkinson, president of New Orleans University, and with the Medical Faculty of the New Orleans Medical Department, with the object of placing their funds, and energy in some work for the medical department of this school. To this end, a special meeting was called, and Dr. Atkinson and Dr. Newman invited to address the Club. As president of the University, Dr. Atkinson stated his opinion as to the help the club could give, the needs of the medical department in regard to a sanitarium, clinic, and nurses, gave interesting statistics of probable costs, and suggested plans of management, rules of admission and other necessary little details. Dr. Newman, as one of the principal lecturers in the department, and a physician of wide experience, followed, with supplementary information.</p><p xml:id="era3_13086">The upshot of the whole matter is, that the Phyllis Wheatley club is about to start a sanitarium and training school for nurses to be established in the New Orleans Medical School Building. There are to be pay wards, and free wards, a matron, head nurse, and facilities for the training of a limited number of young women who wish to become perfected in the noble art of caring for the sick. Of course, there will be limitations to the whole affair, at first. The work will begin on a small scale, but it is hoped that when everyone sees the reality of the talked of plans, the public spirited colored citizens of the city will come to its assistance as nobly as they have done in other charitable institutions.</p><pb xml:id="era3_13087" n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><p xml:id="era3_13088">Dr. Atkinson has promised to have the building ready for the wards and rooms by the early part of September, and now the members of the club have their hands full of summer work in perfecting plans of organization, arranging rules, boards of directors, raising sufficient sums of money, and other such work.</p><p xml:id="era3_13089">The first gift to the new cause was made by the Peabody Alumni, which kindly turned over to the Sanitarium Fund all the ready money it had in its treasury. The corner-stone just laid was highly appreciated by all club members.</p><p xml:id="era3_13090">At the May meeting, the members of the club were addressed on the "Legal Status of Woman in Louisiana" by the Hon. L.A. Martinet. It was an interesting lecture, not only from the earnestness of the speaker, but that it threw some light on darkly mysterious position of woman's legal status in the state.</p><p xml:id="era3_13091">The club has appointed its delegate to represent it at Washington in July.</p><byline>ALICE RUTH MOORE.</byline></div><div xml:id="era3_21.15" type="Article"><head rend="center">HARRIET TUBMAN.</head><docAuthor>Victoria Earle</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_13092">Efforts are now being put forward to bring before the young generation the last of the grand characters identified with the "uprising of a great people." The woman whom the great-hearted Mrs. Sarah H. Bradford of Geneva, said, is "worthy to be handed down to posterity side and side with the names of Joan of Arc, Grace Darling, and Florence Nightingale."</p><p xml:id="era3_13093">"In my opinion" says Wendell Phillips, "There are few Captains, perhaps few Colonels, who have done more for the loyal cause since the war began, and few men who did that before that time, more for the colored race, than our fearless and most sagacious friend, Harriet Tubman. The last time I ever saw John Brown was under my own roof, as he brought Harriet Tubman to me, saying, 'Mr. Phillips I bring you one of the best and bravest persons on this Continent. <hi rend="italic">General</hi> Tubman, as we call her.'"</p><p xml:id="era3_13094">This wonderful woman became famous before the fall of Sumter, by conducting hundreds of slaves to freedom, through the system known as the "Under Ground Railroad." So daring and intrepid was she, that sums averaging from 12 to 40,000 dollars were offered for her capture by the slave oligarchy. During the rebellion, she was employed as scout, guide and nurse, and served all through the war, acknowledged and appreciated by all the great characters having charge of the affairs of state and war at that time. At the conclusion of hostilities, she quietly retired into private life and a short while ago gave her modest dwelling over to be a "home for the aged and homeless of her race."</p><p xml:id="era3_13095">It will be an inspiration for the rising generation to see and clasp hands with this noble mother in Israel! She has attained the advanced age of 80 years, and should God in his providence bless the efforts now being put forth toward having her present at the Convention in Washington, we hope our people will give her a true Chautauquan welcome. We expect to reproduce her photograph on our souvenir programme. This alone will make them valuable. We hope to bring such pressure to bear upon our grate body of Afro-American Women, that a great unrest will seize our women, that the cry, "What shall we do to elevate, purify and upbuild our race?" will burst spontaneously from thousands of earnest hearts, all over this land. All over our country, thousands of women are awakening to the fact that a new day is, dawning of our people, and that a tidal wave of deep heartfelt anxiety for better and purer homes, healthier and better trained children, broader and more helpful educational missionary work is sweeping over the great body of Afro-American Women. So at the very beginning of this new day let us all meet in the benign presence of this great leader, in days and actions, that caused strong men to quail this almost unknown, almost unsung "Black Joan of Arc," to whom the lamented Frederick Douglass once wrote - "Most that I have done and suffered in the service of our cause has been in public, and I have received much encouragement at every step of the way. You on the other hand have labored in a private way. I have wrought in the day - you in the night. I have had the applause of the crowd and the satisfaction that comes of being approved by the multitude, while the most you have done has been witnessed by a few trembling scarred and footsore bondmen and women, whom you have led out of the house of bondage, and whose heartfelt 'God bless you' has been your only reward. The midnight sky and the silent stars have been the witnesses of your devotion to freedom and of your heroism.</p><p xml:id="era3_13096">The primary object of the Federation is to bring our women together, we owe it to our children, to uncover from partial oblivion and unconscious indifference the great characters within our own ranks. The fact that we know so little that is creditably and truly noble about our own people constitutes one of the saddest and most humiliating phases of Afro-American life. Every woman who feels that is so, should rally now, and aid the great Cause, represented by The National Federation of Afro-American Women, and so nobly championed by our own Mrs. Booker T. Washington.</p><byline>Victoria Earle.</byline></div><pb xml:id="era3_13097" n="9 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_21.16" type="Advertisement"><head rend="center">The Woman's Era.<lb/>

She has attained the advanced age of eighty years, and should God in his providence bless the efforts now being put forth toward having her present at the Convention in Washington, we hope our people will give her at rue Chatauquan welcome.</p><p xml:id="era3_130166">We hope to bring such great pressure to bear upon our great body of Afro-American women, that a great unrest will seize our women, that the cry, "What shall we do to elevate, purify and upbuild our race?" will burst spontaneously from thousands of earnest hearts, all over this land. All over our country, thousands of women are awakening to the fact that a new day is dawning for our people, and that a tidal wave of deep, heartfelt anxiety for better and purer homes, healthier and better trained children, broader and more helpful educational and missionary work, is sweeping over the great body of Afro-American women. So at the very beginning of this new day let us all meet in the benign presence of this great leader, in days and actions that caused strong men to quail, this almost unknown, almost unsung "Black Joan of Arc."</p><p xml:id="era3_130167">The primary object of the Federation is to bring our women together. We owe it to our children to uncover from partial oblivion and unconscious indifference the great characters within our own ranks. The fact that we know so little that is creditable and truly noble about our own people constitutes one of the saddest and most humiliating phases of Afro-American life. Every woman who feels that is so, should rally now and aid the great cause.</p><byline>VICTORIA EARLE.</byline><pb xml:id="era3_130168" n="4 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/></div><div xml:id="era3_02.05" type="Advertisements"><head rend="center">Boston Business Calendar.</head><p xml:id="era3_130169"><figure><graphic url="image-content/we321.jpg"/><figDesc>This page features ads for the Boston Business Calendar.

It is now in its third year and speaks for itself. Every man and woman can judge whether there is need for such a paper and whether that need has been met with any degrees of ability.</p><p xml:id="era3_130216">The N.F.A.A.W. takes especial prid ein the conferring of a degree upon B.T. Washington by Harvard College. Through the president, the wife of Mr. Washington, some of the glory depends upon our organization.</p><p xml:id="era3_130217">The advertisements in the souvenir number of the ERA have more than the usual significance. A large number of our principal business men of the different cities are here represented. This is not the ordinary advertising scheme, but was designed for a business showing. Because of the limited time, the showing is not as representative as it might have been, and is, in fact, what might be called a sample only.</p><p xml:id="era3_130218">Never before in the history of our women has there been such deep and widespread interest in club work. The woman of all sections have been aroused and are deeply concerned about the proper disposition of many questions bearing upon the practical upbuilding of character, and all that pertains to home. An effort has been made to bring to the front women who are not only doing good work along philanthropic lines, but those who have founded and maintained orphan asylums, homes and infirmaries for the aged, infirm and unfortunate. In this particular the program is most unique. It also calls attention to the fact that though the Afro-American is recorded as being the most religious of people, yet he does not provide systematically for the weak and erring of the racial family. The women are alive to this great failing, and will not rest until a rescue brigade shall have been inaugurated by black women, for the upbuilding of struggling human kind. The isolated log cabin women and children will have a place upon the program. This is as it should be, for until the masses of our women know that there is such a thing as an Afro-American woman's organization anxious to better their condition, little good will result. The south has been well canvassed, and it is the aim of the National Federation of Afro-American Women to carry sympathy and enlightenment to the masses.</p><p xml:id="era3_130219">The National Virginia Baptist S. S. Union, with over a thousand members, will be represented by delegates. The True Reformers will be represented by the distinguished founder of the order, Mr. W.W. Browne. Mr. Browne and Harriet Tubman will be the romantic figures of the convention.</p><p xml:id="era3_130220">The Hon. John W.

In 1880 her parents moved West and settled in Denver. Miss Thompson graduated from the Denver High School at the age of seventeen, the youngest of a class of 75 members. In January, 1892, after much difficulty and discouragement, she secured a position in the county treasurer's office as general clerk. Since entering the office she has held the positions of filing clerk, corresponding clerk and in 1895 was promoted on merit to the position of assistant bookkeeper, which position she still holds. Notwithstanding changes in administrations, Miss Thompson has been successful in retaining her position with credit.</p><p xml:id="era3_130257">Miss Thompson is also accomplished, being a pianist and the possessor of a rich contralto voice.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_02.12" type="Report"><head rend="center"> CLUBDOM.</head><docAuthor>E.P.

At Utica, in the winter of 1869, he projected what is known as the Koreshan System. This is a universal design, embracing physical science as a basis of social construction and government, with such an economic arrangement of society as to equitably distribute the products of industry.</p><p xml:id="era3_130303">Dr. Teed is a friend of the colored race, and includes in his system the purpose of insuring to the race all the rights to which they, as citizens, are entitled, both in the north and south. He has established a number of colonies, among which is one in South Florida, where he has gathered many believers. At Estero, Lee County, Florida, his colony has a saw and planing mill in operation, also a shingle mill, machine shops and ship yards.</p><p xml:id="era3_130304">They are developing on many lines of industry, and his intent is to place his colonist in all branches of industry. Their educational system is of the most advanced order. The colony in Florida is located beautifully on the mainland, and on the islands of Estero Bay, where climate soil and latitude are in every way favorable to the project of building up a great commercio-maratime city. Judging from the progress already made, after an effort of only about two years in Estero, the indications point to the ultimate success of the doctor's plans: and his success implies a great advancement in the moral development, general education, practical mechanical application and social elevation of the people he desires to aid.</p><p xml:id="era3_130305">Dr. Teed is now visiting his people in Denver. Through his visits here an dour acquaintance with his people we have been made somewhat familiar with him and his work.</p><byline>E.P.E.</byline></div><pb xml:id="era3_130306" n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_02.17" type="Article"><head rend="center">Mr. J.H. Lewis.</head><p xml:id="era3_130307">Mr. J.H. Lewis, whose advertisement appears in this issue of the ERA, hardly needs an introduction to our readers. His splendid tailoring establishment on Washington street, Boston, is one of the finest of its kind in the country, and has opened up business opportunities to numbers of colored boys. Mr. Lewis has the genius of business, and has proved that he can successfully run more than one large establishment at the same time.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_02.18" type="Article"><head rend="center">"Solution to the Race Problem."</head><docAuthor>Dr. Teed</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130308">The fact that the progressions of racial development depend upon ethnic filtration does not require argument to establish. The only question to the problem is, What are the physiological conditions essential to the amalgamation of the colored with the white races?</p><p xml:id="era3_130309">It is a commonly apprehended truth that in the mixing of the colored with the white blood there is a projective nonviability to progeny which militates against the possible transmission of a vital and viable stamina and that a strict fidelity to the laws of physiology precludes any conscientious effort towards the settlement of the racial problem by amalgamation.</p><p xml:id="era3_130310">The negro race is destined to take a most prominent part in the future civilizations of the world. Its animal viability is pronounced apparent, and the religious and emotional nature carries with it an enthusiasm of power and devotion that scarcely has an equal among any of the nations of the earth.</p><p xml:id="era3_130311">While the religious principle is intense the moral character requires the discipline and development of culture and refinement.</p><p xml:id="era3_130312">This cannot come through example merely. Something must enter the race to impart to it a moral tone which it can only derive through the introduction of a force from a more advanced plane of development. As the blood of the Lord Jesus was transplanted in a spiritual way for the elevation of the Character of those who received him, so the black race must receive in a natural way the essential force for its own elevation. In other words through ethnic filtration the black
race must modify its complexion and ethnic character. This can be done only through the enforcement of a specific understanding and the application of definite principles.</p><p xml:id="era3_130313">These factors in the problem of ethnic development are extremely radical, so much so that it is very questionable whether the colored people themselves are prepared in any measure at present for suggestions in the direction of a scientific modification of the anatomical structure and thence an advancement in functional power and capacity.</p><p xml:id="era3_130314">The Jewish race owes its greatness to the application of the principle and ceremony of male circumcision. The present commercial nations of the world represented by the Anglo-Saxon, owe their commercial greatness to the fact that through ethnic infiltrament the lost Israel was absorbed in Media, Persia and Assyria and thence produced the Germanic family the Anglo-Saxon being one of the principle lines of ethnic progress. The commercial greatness of the Anglo-Saxon comes directly from the Jewish male circumcision.</p><p xml:id="era3_130315">The coming infiltrament of the black with the white will owe its possibility to the application of the principle and ceremony of female circumcision introduced as a scientific religious rite. The character of this ceremony must belong to a mind scientific enough to comprehend it in all its bearings upon female life and the progeny of miscegenation, as the intellectual prescience of the mind who ordered the enforcement of male circumcision comprehended that ritual in all its possibilities for the resurrection of the son of God in humanity. Had it not been for the circumcision of the Israelites the Christ could not have come to the world.</p><p xml:id="era3_130316">This paper is merely suggestive of racial possibilities. It may be influential in causing one man to think. The multitude is not yet sufficiently ripe to comprehend its force.</p><byline>Dr. Teed.</byline></div><pb xml:id="era3_130317" n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_02.19" type="Article"><head rend="center">Samuel E.

This union resulted in one of the largest and most significant organizations of women in the world. The WOMAN'S ERA, which had been the official organ of the Federation, was chosen by the joint commission on union as the official organ of the united body with a special department to be edited and controlled by department editors, who were then and there elected by the same committee.</p><p xml:id="era3_130470">In a vast body like ours, numbering as it does two hundred clubs, an organ as a communication is an absolute necessity.

Surely no one conversant with our present status, and concerned about our future, can doubt that there is a crying need of just such a union of forces as our association represents.</p><p xml:id="era3_130476">As individuals, our women have already accomplished much for the education and cultivation of the race.

While as a unit we shall bend our energies to compass the ends for which we have banded together, as diverse and varied will be the plans adopted as are the individualities of the different organizations of which the association is composed. Union of forces is not construed to mean monotony of ways and means, in presenting the work to which we are solemnly and irrevocably pledged.

The duties of my office shall be discharged faithfully, the friends of the association may rest assured, and efficiently, let us trust, for the sake of our common cause.

After giving a most charming pen-picture of the house, and the gracious hospitality of the venerable widow of the great abolitionist, Mrs. Stowe described some of his sacred mementos, gifts from friends and associates in the cause of freedom, treasured by the family, making special mention of the seal used by Mr. Clarkson. She wrote: "His seal attracted my attention. It was a kneeling figure of the Negro with clasped hands, which was at first adopted as the badge of the cause, when every means was being made use of to arouse the public mind and keep the subject before the attention. Mr. Wedgewood, the celebrated porcelain manufacturer, designed a cameo with this representation, which was much worn as an ornament by ladies. It was engraved on the seal of the Anti-Slavery society, and it was used by its members in sealing all their letters. This of Clarkson's was handsomely engraved on a large, old-fashioned cornelian, and surely if we look with emotion on the sword of a departed hero, which at best we can only consider as a necessary evil, we may look with unmingled pleasure on this memorial of a bloodless victory."</p><p xml:id="era3_130483">The great Clarkson's methods in bringing about the emancipation of the bondmen on English soil possess many sterling lessons for us who would carry on the present day work of emancipation among our struggling people, and should be carefully studied. One of his first steps was the formation of a committee of twelve persons for the collection and dissemination of evidence on the slave traffic. We would do well to follow in his footsteps, by the establishment of such committees to collect and disseminate evidence on the legislative enactments inimical to our interests. This could be done with great propriety in connection with the chain-gang system and the separate car law.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_03.05" type="Article"><head rend="center">THE <seg type="short-title">FREDERICK DOUGLASS MEMORIAL</seg> AND PILGRIMAGE ASSOCIATION.</head><p xml:id="era3_130484">This is the name adopted by a party of impromptu visitors to Anacostia on the day following the adjournment of the Federation meetings. Perhaps it was from inspiration from the surroundings; certainly it was from no prearrangement that the twenty odd callers suddenly decided to band themselves together to work for the securing of the Douglass homestead for a Mecca to which pilgrimages may be made, and in which an historical collection of anti-slavery literature and other race data may be kept. Mr. Douglass' widow was made president of the new association. A secretary and treasurer were elected, the nucleus of a fund contributed, and each club representative pledged herself to see to it that her own club kept green the memory of Mr. Douglass by fittingly celebrating his birthday on the 22nd of each February. Then the association adjourned to the vine clad porch overlooking the Potomac, and succumbed to the omnipresent and irresistible photographer.</p><pb xml:id="era3_130485" n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/></div><div xml:id="era3_03.06" type="Article"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">THEY ENTERTAINED THE FEDERATION</seg> AND PROMOTED THE SUCCESS OF THE CONVENTION.</head><docAuthor>Josephine B. Bruce</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130486">The Ladies' Auxiliary Association of Washington, D. C., while one of the youngest members of the Federation, having joined its ranks only a few weeks prior to the assembling of the convention, was notwithstanding one of the most enthusiastic among the large and highly creditable membership of the Federation. The auxiliary felt, in a large degree, that the Federation was its guest, and the pleasure and pride in having so noble a gathering in our home city was evinced on every hand by the ceaseless and untiring activity of our ladies.</p><p xml:id="era3_130487">The local citizens' committee, composed of both ladies and gentlemen, were persistent in their zeal to promote the comfort and entertainment of the convention. The two ladies worked in unison to the best of their abilities, with what results the visitors must decide. We can only testify to the hearty good-will and generosity of spirit coupled with the earnest desire to make every visitor feel perfectly at home</p><p xml:id="era3_130488">The lunches for the three days' sessions, the decorations and the reception held on the closing night were the work of the two named bodies.</p><p xml:id="era3_130489">The citizens of Washington will always recall with unbounded satisfaction the convention of the N.F. of A.A.W. Such a glorious hand of earnest women must always, even in memory, be an inspiration. The great organization, as a whole, as well as the members as individuals, were possessed with the mighty purpose to relieve the stress and burden of life, which continue to exist largely on account of inactivity, ignorance or the disposition to accept whatever is, without
murmuring. The wrongs and injustices which afflict the many spring from a misconception of the relation of man to man. Now, as ever, is it true that,</p><p xml:id="era3_130490"><q>"Man's inhumanity to man<lb/>

The feeling thus exhibited must not be misunderstood; it was not regret because of the union -- not at all -- for I believe that one and all cordially endorsed the principle involved in union, but it was simply expressive of the beautiful devotion to the

The Exposition is laid out in a suburb of Berlin known as Treptow, which was formerly a playground for children. The most enjoyable way of going there is by mail-coach, although this mode of conveyance is considered too expensive by most of the visitors who visit the Exposition. The approach to the grounds is a long avenue, with booth after booth, show after show on either side, ending up in the night with the Cairo Exhibit, which is decided the most realistic and successful part of the Exposition. It ought to have been called Egypt rather than Cairo, because quite as much of life on the Nile as of life as seen in Cairo is represented there. The temple, like the pyramid, is an excellent piece of workmanship, albeit both have too new and clean an appearance to strongly resemble the originals. The most advantageous time in which to see Cairo is at twilight, or after dark, when the gay bazaars with their wily salesmen, and the well imitated Egyptian horses wear a truly oriental aspect. The Egyptians themselves are unmistakably genuine, and their noisy ways and curious antics, and the camels and donkeys which they tend, render the illusion a perfect one. A truly imposing sight is the Egyptian circus which goes on all the evening in the large arena upon which you look down from the top of the Pyramid. The ascent is made by elevator, the Pyramid being hollow; you unconsciously fancy yourself in the desert, while intently watching the ever moving mass of human beings and of animals, and the motley array of color which stands out so strongly against the gray background.</p><p xml:id="era3_130498">The Cameron Exhibit is both interesting and amusing, but is soon exhausted. The natives show off their hats and the way in which they prepare their meals with great glee. They are particularly proud of their scanty knowledge of the German language which, however, they pronounce uncommonly well. By far the most entertaining inhabitant of the Cameron village is a mite of a baby whose comical ways and friendly hand-shakes win all hearts.</p><p xml:id="era3_130499">The Berliners, of course, think a great deal of their Exposition, but to those who have seen and enjoyed the wonders of our World's Fair, it is difficult not to make detrimental comparisons, even while bearing in mind that this is the effort of one city alone -- since the principal buildings, the lake, the boats and so on are so evidently an attempt at direct imitation, in miniature, of the Chicago Exposition.</p><p xml:id="era3_130500">The industrial exhibits vary in interest and in value, and the pleasure grounds - the Midway Plaisance of this Exposition -- contain but a collection of cheap, bawdy shows. Of these, the hall devoted to automatic machines and instruments is the best, the automatic orchestra being a very musical and ingenious toy on a large scale.</p><p xml:id="era3_130501">Old Berlin is considered a great success. Seen from the water it looks very well, but it is really much inferior to old Vienna of Chicago fame and not nearly as well carried out as the old Dresden part of the small industrial exposition now in progress in Dresden.</p><p xml:id="era3_130502">The Chicago Fair covered so large an area that the throngs of people were no more than groups in the landscape when scattered over the grounds. In Berlin the space used for the Exposition seems so small a one that one is impressed by the vast multitude of people which assembles there on a fine evening. The place to see the fashionable world of Berlin and the foreign element is not Bressel's restaurant which faces the chief building at the other end of the lake, but the whole lake is surrounded by swarms of people full of the enjoyment of out-of-door life that is so pleasant a characteristic of the German people. They sit at tables drinking beer, listening to the music and watching the boats glide about. The weekly illuminations naturally attract the largest crowds of people, who are never other than well behaved. The colors used in illuminating are too gaudy to be beautiful, particularly when compared with the exquisite harmony which made illumination nights at Chicago a never-to-be-forgotten memory.</p><p xml:id="era3_130503">-- Dresden.</p><pb xml:id="era3_130504" n="7 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/></div><div xml:id="era3_03.08" type="Poem"><head rend="center">THE CONVERSAZZHYONY.</head><docAuthor>Eugene Field</docAuthor><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">The maynoo that wuz spread that night wuz mighty</l><l>hard to beat.</l><l>Though somewhat awkward to pernouuce, it wuz not</l><l>so to eat;</l><l>There wuz puddins, pies an' sandwidges, an' forty</l><l>kinds uv sass,</l><l>An' floatin' Irelands, custards, tarts an' patty dee for</l><l>grass;</l><l>An' millions uv Cove oysters wuz a-settin' round in</l><l>pans,</l><l>'Nd other native fruits an' things that grew out West</l><l>in cans.</l><l>But I wuz all kufflummuxed when Hoover said he'd</l><l>choose</l><l> "0on peety morso, see voo play, de la celte Charlatte</l><l>Rooze!"</l><l>I'd knowed three-fingered Hoover for fifteen years or</l><l>more</l><l>'Nd I'd never heern him speak so light uv wimmin</l><l>folks before!</l><l>Bill Goslin heern him say it, 'nd uv course he spread</l><l>the news</l><l>Uv how Three-fingered Hoover had insulted Charlotte</l><l>Rooze</l><l>At the conversazzhyony down at Sorry Tom's that</l><l>night;</l><l>An' when they asked me, I allowed that Bill for once</l><l>wuz right,</l><l>Although it broke my heart to see my friend go up the</l><l>fluke.</l><l>We all opined his treatment uv the girl deserved</l><l>rebuke.</l><l>It warnt no use for Sorry Tom to nail it for a lie --</l><l>When it came to sassin' wimmin, there wuz blood in</l><l>every eye;</l><l>The boom for Charlotte Rooze swep' on an' took the</l><l>polls by storm,</l><l>An' so Three-fingered Hoover fell a martyr to reform!</l><l>Three-fingered Hoover said it wuz a terrible mistake,</l><l>vAn' when the votes wuz in, he cried ez if his heart</l><l>would break.</l><l>We never knew who Charlotte wuz, but Goslin's</l><l>brother Dick</l><l>Allowed she wuz the teacher from the camp on Roarin' </l><l>Crick,</l><l>That had come to pass some foreign tongue with them</l><l>uv our alite,</l><l>Ez wuz at the high-toned party down at Sorry Tom's</l><l>that night.</l><l>We let it drop -- this matter uv the lady -- there an'</l><l>then,</l><l>An' we never heerd, or wanted to, of Charlotte Rooze</l><l>again,</l><l>An' the Colorado wimmin-folks, ez like ez not don't</l><l>know</l><l>How we vindicated all their sex a twenty year ago.</l></lg></div><div xml:id="era3_03.09" type="Minutes"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">THE FORTHCOMING MINUTES</seg> OF THE FIRST ANNUAL MEETING OF THE N.F.A.A.W.</head><docAuthor>Victoria Matthews</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130505">All persons holding papers prepared for the first annual convention of the National Federation

Mrs. Butler and Mrs. Hunton, whose pictures are given this month, represented the Federation on the commission with intelligence and gracious zeal.

The success of Bryan, and the subsequent free coinage of silver, would not only affect the purchasing power of the present wages and salaries of the wage earners, to which class the colored people of this country mainly belong, but would decrease by almost one-half the value of the little stock of money that the thrifty among them have been able to lay aside and entrust to savings or co-operative banks. Those of them who, by incessant industry and much deprivation, have been able to meet their payments in life insurance companies, believing that, if anything should happen, some comfort and even some small luxuries of this life would be assured their widows and orphans, should arouse themselves in opposition to threatening legislation of free silver. Their widows would receive just fifty-three cents for every dollar of their life insurance. Under the authority of the United States, in the even of free silver, the savings banks, for an invested dollar of one hundred cents, would pay back a dollar worth fifty-three cents. Are the colored people of this country so rich or so indifferent to their future welfare that they can see their accumulations for a rainy day cut almost in halves, one portion only to remain theirs, while the other be given to the silver mine owners? Yet this is just what the success of Bryan, Tillman and Altgeld means. It is a solemn duty for every mother, wife and sister to arouse their husbands, sons and brothers to a realizing sense of the terrible results that will surely follow in the wake of the success of the free silver heresy. The woman should take as  active an interest in this question as possible. Only a small number are allowed to show their interest by voting themselves, directly, but they all know their power and should see to it that no voter over whom they have any influence is on the wrong side of this question.</p><p xml:id="era3_130519" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era3_130521">All of the clubs in the national organization should, upon their reassembling in the early au-

Educational work is what the women's clubs are formed for, and the most important educational need just now, among all women, is systematized, careful instruction in American politics. The present campaign, called a campaign of education, offers opportunities for all who desire an intelligent understanding of current issues; and what club woman does not?</p><p xml:id="era3_130522" rend="divider"/><p xml:id="era3_130523">Now that the new association is launched and all eyes are fixed upon the new officers who are to order the great craft, and all hearts are wishing them success and good weather, it is well that a thought should be given to the old officers, the women of the National Federation and National League who made this thing possible -- the women some of whom have been in their self sacrifice and devotion to the interests of their associations models for all successors.</p><p xml:id="era3_130524">The work that has been done in the last year has been in some ways almost marvellous, and our women should not forget that it did not do itself, but represents intelligence, industry and devotion.

The average cynical man would have expected that in such a large and -- if I may use the term -- varied assemblage of women of all ages and personalities, frivolity and gossip would naturally creep in; but not so. Every woman present seemed to feel that she had gone a long way to discuss matters of gravest importance, and that it behooved her as a representative of other earnest women to stick to her text. The all important question, "Is my bonnet straight?" was never even dreamed of.</p><p xml:id="era3_130536">History is made of little things, after all. It was a pretty little scene in one of the committee rooms, that ought to go down in the history of the Afro-American woman - if one should be written. Mrs. Ida Wells-Barnett, whom every one knows, is positive and determined in her opinions, and her expression of them, gracefully and gently, yielded to the pleasure of Mrs. Lucy B. Thurman when the question of endorsing in an unqualified manner the work of the W.C.T.U. was raised. Considering the differences of opinion between Miss Willard and Mrs. Barnett, and the utterances of the former in regard to the work of the latter, the introduction of such a resolution was somewhat after the fashion of a slap in Mrs. Barnett's face. But she gracefully gave her approval to its passage, and thus added another heroic act to the list of self-sacrificing acts done at Washington.</p><p xml:id="era3_130537">Heroines are not entirely the products of ancient days. Every hour that Mrs. Washington stood on the platform during the days of the convention stamped her as a heroine of the purest type. Ill and physically in no condition to be out, she stood the strain of the entire proceedings, with an unflinching calmness that a less brave woman could not but envy. There is no use denying that it takes great mental, physical and nervous force to preside over any body at any given time, and the fact that Mrs. Washington stood calmly through it all in her illness, is something for which we all should feel it our duty to throw up our hats and cheer.</p><p xml:id="era3_130538">The office of national organizer, which was created by the joint commission from the two organizations, is unique only in its name. It is an office which no national organization should be without. In the Woman's Relief Corps, which is one of the largest of this country, the work is done by a national instituting and instaling officer, who has an assistant in every state, this assistant in turn having assistants in the state corps. The work is thus brought to a finesse which constantly enlarges the ranks of the organization. It was a wise thought on the part of the commission to create such an office, as we need more systematic methods and more enthusiasm in organization. It was, perhaps, as wise, too, that they should have chosen Mrs. Matthews to fill the office, for she is particularly interested in that branch of work, and by her splendid amount of personal magnetism cannot but succeed in bringing into the ranks of the association many new and vigorous clubs.</p><p xml:id="era3_130539">Will we succeed in perfecting the proposed scheme of departmental or state work? Of course it is for the executive and constitution committees to say that, but it is to be hoped that we will, for the present system will soon become, as new clubs are enlisted, cumberson and heavy.</p><p xml:id="era3_130540">This year was the crucial one, and now that the great feat of consolidation has been accomplished, we can draw a long breath and settle into plans and schemes for great deeds to be accomplished ere July, 1897. With such a body of women, all of whom have already shown their power in many different lines, the weight of the organization should be felt in more ways than one. It is to be hoped so.</p><byline>ALICE RUTH MOORE.</byline></div><pb xml:id="era3_130541" n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_03.16" type="Minutes"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">FIRST MINUTES</seg> OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLORED WOMEN.</head><docAuthor>Mary Church Terrell and Frances Jackson</docAuthor><div xml:id="era3_03.16.01" type="Minutes"><head rend="center">Washington D.C., July 21, 1896</head><docAuthor>Mary Church Terrell and Frances Jackson</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130542">The joint commission, consisting of seven members of the National League of Colored Women and an equal number from the National Federation of Afro-American Women, assembled in the parlor of the 19th St. Baptist Church to consider the advisability of union.

It was at first proposed to celebrate this occasion by the opening of an Exposition, so far reaching as to even become international in its character. For many excellent reasons this plan was not carried out and the opening of the Exposition was postponed until May 1, 1897; it will continue for six months, closing October 31 of the same year. The anniversary was celebrated by ceremonies extending over two days, June 1 and 2, and consisted of the firing of guns, street parades, composed of state and federal troops, federal, state and city officials, social, benevolent and industrial orders, municipal departments, bicycle brigades, citizens in carriages, on horseback and on foot, and exercises at the centennial grounds, in the auditorium and woman's
building.</p><p xml:id="era3_130557">The centennial grounds are already in excellent and beautiful condition and several of the buildings are completed. The management propose to have everything in complete readiness for the opening of the Exposition on May 1, 1897.</p><p xml:id="era3_130558">It has been divided into sixteen departments, each with a chief and working committee, and among this number is the Negro department with J.C. Napier as chief and a committee of sixteen. Chief Napier desires it fully understood that this department is not a case of discrimination but was a choice, that the negroes might secure a better showing and receive full credit for their industry and advancement. It is entirely optional as to whether the exhibitor will place his exhibit in the Negro building or the one designated for his line of exhibits. Since his appointment Chief Napier has not only been supported by the heads of the different divisions and their committees but has met with great encouragement from residents of other states. One of the divisions is designated as a Woman's Board and has a membership of forty of our most energetic women. Mrs. Ella S. Moore is its president; Mrs. C. Napier 1st, Mrs. Preston Taylor 2nd, Mrs. S. J. W. Early 3rd, Mrs. G. A. Shelbon 4th vice-president; Mrs. P. R. Bumes, secretary; Miss J.B. Cheatham, corresponding secretary; Mrs. W.0. Tate, treasurer.</p><p xml:id="era3_130559">The executive committee is made up of the officers of the board and transacts most of the business, but places it before the board for its approval or rejection. A spirit of complete harmony pervades each meeting, and the united desire seems to be the advancement of any aim that will promote the welfare of the Negro building, but more especially make the woman's exhibit the feature of the department. Everything that is skilfully and well made by a female is desired, and the women have no fear as to what they can accomplish. Not only have they the assurance from Nashville and other places in Tennessee, but Mrs. Moore is traveling in the north and east and is never forgetful of the Tennessee Centennial, and Mrs. Napier has received hearty co-operation from many of our leading women all over the country.</p><p xml:id="era3_130560">Many large bodies have been invited and are arranging to hold their meetings here during the Exposition, and among the number will be the second meeting of the Woman's Congress which met for the first time at Atlanta during the holding of its Exposition.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_03.18" type="Article"><head rend="center">TUSKEGEE NORMAL AND INDUSTRIAL INSTITUTE.</head><docAuthor>Isaac Fisher</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130561">TUSKEGEE, ALA.</p><p xml:id="era3_130562">School opens on the 8th of September.</p><p xml:id="era3_130563">Night school closed on the 31st of July.

Miss Helen Villard is the daughter of Fanny Garrison Villard,
<pb xml:id="era3_130566" n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
whom old Bostonians will remember as the handsome and only daughter of the original Garrison family. Miss Villard, as might be expected from heredity and environment such as hers, is public spirited and an enthusiastic reformer. She is a subscriber to the ERA, and intensely interested in the cause it seeks to promote.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_03.20" type="Article"><head rend="center">ADDITIONAL CONVENTION NOTES.</head><p xml:id="era3_130568">From the platform, the auditorium of the Nineteenth St. Baptist Church was a delight to the eye, on the evening of the first day of the gathering of the late Federation of Afro-American Women for their first annual convention. The audience, which was an immense one, was made up about equally of men and women of all colors and ages. As is customary in that latitude in the summer time, many of the ladies came to the meeting without head covering of any kind, radiant in white and vari-colored costumes, trimmed with ribbons and much lace, which seemed to soften and tone down the almost too eager and anxious look of the matrons and maids gathered to be a part of the great object lesson. At Mrs. Washington's request, Mrs. Matthews presided upon this occasion, and in presenting the speakers she was at her best. Her incidental plea, made just here, for greater interest and sympathy for the women and children of the southern cabins, did credit to both her head and heart. The address of welcome by District Commissioner Ross was impressive from its earnest heartiness. The Era Club president was honored by being selected to reply to this eloquent greeting, and embraced the opportunity to tell something of the inception of the one year old movement that was showing such astonishing results.</p><p xml:id="era3_130569">The resolutions adopted were strong, comprehensive and pathetic in the recount of the many needs of a much hampered people. The pathos was emphasized by the reading of them by Mrs. Ida B. Wells Barnett, in the musical monotone peculiar to that polished reader. The resolutions are to be published in full, with the minutes, in book form. This work was placed in the hands of a competent committee, of which Mrs. Victoria Matthews is chairman, and is now being edited by her.</p><p xml:id="era3_130570">All of the members of the Auxiliary Committee did nobly in their hospitable endeavors to make their guests, the conventioners, comfortable and happy, but Mrs. Rosetta Lawson was so conspicuous for her self sacrificing zeal and courtesy as to merit special mention, and more substantial recognition even by those who profited by her unremitting efforts in behalf of unity and fraternity.</p><p xml:id="era3_130571">Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Gray were also enthusiastic workers in the convention. Mr. Gray and Mr. Andrew Hilyer both made stenographic reports of the meetings for leading Washington newspapers.</p><p xml:id="era3_130572">Mrs. Jennie Napier Kemp, secretary of the Twin City Woman's Era Club, St. Pau and Minneapolis, was the only lady newspaper correspondent sent to report proceedings. She represented the leading daily paper of' Minneapolis.</p><p xml:id="era3_130573">Miss Georgia Washington's plea for the plantation women, written and delivered by one who is herself an example of what education will do for this class, was the most encouraging feature of the whole exhibition.</p><p xml:id="era3_130574">When the "Boy of the Convention," Master Charles Aked Barnett, was presented to the convention by Mother Harriet Tubman the scene was impressive and thrilling. it was as though one was standing at the intersection of a tiny stream just bubbling from its source, and of a great useful river about to glide with easy fulness into the sea. It was as the clasping of hands of the early nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p xml:id="era3_130575">If crowded night sessions, an attentive throng of serious faces in the galleries and hearty applause in the right place be a sign of interest taken by the Washingtonians in the proceedings, then indeed was the interest great. Altogether we have stood before the public, attracting an attention on all sides that was perhaps never dreamed of, even in the most sanguine expectations of the projectors of the organization.</p><p xml:id="era3_130577">If there was no downright frivolity during the continuance of the sessions there were many mirth-provoking incidents and personages. The photographer was one of the latter. No one ever thought of asking his name or calling him anything but "the photographer." He was omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent. He seemed to have always in his mind the passage in the prayerbook, "Whenever two or three are gathered to-
<pb xml:id="era3_130576" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
gether in thy name -" for wherever and whenever two or three of the delegates were found at any given point, the photographer was there, camera, battered derby and all, and in less than two minutes perhaps there was a group posing. Even at the last moment when a crowd of us were gathered at the Pennsylvania railroad depot ready to go the photographer was there with a profane suggestion of a parting group. Long rest his piece of mind for the bad pictures he turned out!</p><p xml:id="era3_130578">Some of the most enjoyable moments of the days spent in Washington were those of the noon lunch in the church basement. It was always a lively scene of kaleidoscopic interest. A shifting of faces, forms and an incessant buzz of voices, hungry voices and eager ones. It was during the noon hour that old acquaintances were renewed and new ones made; engagements and parties made up and plans, convention and otherwise, formulated and decided upon. lt was a pleasant little social oasis in the desert of the day's work.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_03.21" type="Club_Notes"><head rend="center">CLUB NOTES.</head><docAuthor>Florida R.

The Christian Endeavor Society brings to Boston fifty thousand delegates in July, railroad rates all over the country are constantly reduced. Many colored women come to Boston at that time as delegates to this convention. The assured presence in this city of so many representative women is too good an opportunity for a coming together to be missed, and although we do not hope that this our first conference will in all respects meet our ideal, yet we trust that it will be the beginning of a movement for creating a community of interest among al earnest women who love purity and demand justice.</p><p xml:id="era3_130584"><hi rend="italic">The letter of Mr. Jacks which is also enclosed is only used to show how pressing is the need of our banding together if only for our protection; this is only one of the many matters upon which we need to confer.

Many of the graduate nurses were present, and one who could remember when there was no home for the nurses' exclusive use. At that time what is now the nurses' home was used as the maternity. The nurses of that period had no such pleasant evenings as we of '95, '95 and '96 have had in the long hall where the piano now stands. I think they certainly deserved their diplomas, for having the heroic courage to pull through the term without the Goddard Home and the piano, which has added much to our happiness. After a hard day of work and discouragements - which we all have - a whirl around the hall did much to cheer our drooping spirits and tired limbs, giving us new zest for tomorrow's work: and those spreads in the Goddard, when some girl has returned from her vacation bringing the good things from home, such as pickles, jams, cakes, apples, etc., or sometimes brought on half days by the more fortunate ones who have their mothers near by, or from the corner store of "odds and ends." Those delightful summer evening spreads of '95, served on the great table-like boulder west of the maternity wards, with iced lemonade, did much to refresh us for the coming morrow, and to say the least the lively band in the adjacent picnic grounds has done its mission. I try to look back and wonder how the pioneer nurses lived through the term. They surely deserve our admiration and love. I was pleased to have the superintendent of nurses ask me to show the improvements of '95 and '96 to one of our graduates of nineteen or more years' standing - the new heating arrangements for keeping the patients' food hot, new sterilizing room at the maternity, the enlargement of the nursery, new boilers and what not - and tell her of many new methods in our work, such as the "floater," etc.: and our new class pin, which was only ready at the last annual meeting, which is composed of a blue enamel Maltese cross, with a wreath of laurel in gold, "New England Hospital Training School - 1863"; and in the center in gold, the bust of Mrs. Ednah Cheney, the president.</p><p xml:id="era3_130723">It is pleasant to feel on returning to Boston that there is the Goddard Home to go to and spend a few hours or an evening, and see familiar objects and loving friends. I do not think that time nor surroundings will ever alienate my affections from the dear N.E. H. </p><p xml:id="era3_130724">The nurses' rooms looked particularly attractive, with the sun streaming in on this beautiful October day, so homelike, and each so characteristic of its occupant.</p><p xml:id="era3_130725">Now that we have our new dispensary building, I hope that time is not far distant when we shall have our new surgical building, with the hope that many of us who love the work and the hospital will be enabled to take a post graduate course.</p><byline>ANNE DILLET.</byline></div><div xml:id="era3_04.02" type="Article"><head rend="center">HARRIET BEECHER STOWE MEMORIAL.</head><p xml:id="era3_130727">Those who turned aside from their ordinary line of duty to attend the memorial exercises of Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, given by the Woman's Club of Mutual Improvement at Brown's Chapel, A.M.E. Church, on the 22nd ult., were abundantly rewarded for their labor. The church was handsomely decorated for the occasion. The stage was covered with beautiful plants and flowers. In the center of the platform was a large
<pb xml:id="era3_130726" n="2 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
portrait of Mrs. Stowe, beautifully draped, and surrounded by pots of green choice plants. Miss A.E. Martin presided at the organ.</p><p xml:id="era3_130728">At 8:15 o'clock the president, Mrs. M.A. Dillard, called the meeting to order. After prayer by Mr. John Sims the club sang, "When the Mists Have Rolled Away." Other selections were also sung, including a solo, "Jesus, Lover of my Soul," which was rendered by Mrs. Benj. Moffett, a member of the club.</p><p xml:id="era3_130729">Unfortunately Mrs. J.H. Eason was detained at home on account of illness, therefore the paper which she was to have read had to be omitted. Then the president, after a few preliminary remarks, in which she showed up the falsity of the claims made by those in sympathy with slavery thirty-five years ago, introduced Rev. Charles L. Harris, the orator of the evening, who said in part:</p><p xml:id="era3_130730">"The monuments of Egypt, Greece and Rome, as others of less renown, the temples, religions and superstructures of all nations, are based upon some public benefit, fancied or real, derived from the persons whose deeds they commemorate. The gratitude of mankind stands with uncovered head and weeping eyes and burdened heart at the grave of a public benefactor, whose life, though long, seems but a span when once its beneficent rays are quenched. When beneficence, as boundless as eternity, leaps the barriers of race and creed, every emotion of the human heart dictates that gratitude, unfettered and strong, should embrace good deeds wherever found.</p><p xml:id="era3_130731">"The development of the anti-slavery movement produced no stronger character than Harriet Beecher Stowe. Of strong moral character, clear-sighted, warm-hearted, courageous and talented, her pen was mightier than millions of swords. She never suffers by comparison with others. A woman, yet wielding the most incisive pen of the day - a wife, a mother, untrammeled by caste or shackles, yet not so deeply immersed in her own duties as to forget her less fortunate sable sister. A lover of liberty for herself, she finds no rest while this priceless boon is denied the most humble of mankind. She thought if her people knew the hideousness of slavery they would worship at its shrine no longer.</p><p xml:id="era3_130732">"She had a story to tell - a story of great and grievous wrong unredressed and active, whose agents north an perpetrators south had chained the truth and barred the Temple of Liberty. She sung her song: she told her story. The inspiration of heaven dictated it. The mysterious warrior - 'Uncle Tom's Cabin' -- leaped full-armed from her brain to the battle field. Uncle Tom entered the public conscience as no preacher, orator, statesman or press had ever done. It carried conviction. People read and shuddered. It was published in more than twenty different languages. Millions wept with Aunt Chloe at Uncle Tom's departure, laughed with Topsy, prayed with Uncle Tom, or cursed the brute Legree.</p><p xml:id="era3_130733">Great reforms have their flood-tide. When sudden success seems certain, then they ebb, when all gains seem lost. Then with irresistible force a tide wave floods out all opposition, and victory is assured. A Supreme Governor guides human affairs. He fits instruments, and when He wills the blow falls with unerring certainty, and human sagacity cannot evade it. We must "learn to labor and to wait." Mrs. Stowe labored, she waited; she was crowned with success.</p><p xml:id="era3_130734">"Beneficance is sexless. A woman may not inquire, 'What may I, a poor, weak woman do?' But with willing mind, cheerful hands, and a heart aglow with love, do good under all circumstances, -- cheer the faint-hearted, open the door for the returning prodigal, visit the sick, and held the needy whose just pride prevents public aid. Mrs. Stowe's contribution was needed to advance the cause of freedom. We cannot have another like her; but why should not others carry on the work begun by her? Are we too enthusiastic if we expect a continuation of the good deeds already reported of the Woman's Club of Mutual Improvement? Will you forgive the heart-throbs of contemplation with which we view the National Association of Colored Women? From north to south, from east to west it is pledged to the welfare and development of our women along all lines.</p><p xml:id="era3_130735">"The ashes of Mrs. Stowe are buried, but she is not dead. She cannot die. We need no Peter to raise this Dorcas. Her clothing for the poor need no display: for millions of willing hands and loving hearts, responsive to her good deeds, are emulating them: and these good deeds have clothed countless millions in the impenetrable panoply of liberty. Mrs. Stowe's life and labors demonstrate that one woman that wills, can accomplish  more good than many men who <hi rend="italic">will</hi>not."</p><p xml:id="era3_130737">The club then sang a hymn written by Mrs. Stowe - "Knocking, Knocking, Who is There," after which further remarks were made by Rev.

Mrs. Dillard also told a story from "Uncle Tom's Cabin" for the benefit of the children in the audience.</p><p xml:id="era3_130738">The whole affair was very enjoyable throughout, and every one went home well pleased with what they had heard.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_04.03" type="Article"><head rend="center">GOLDEN RULE CLUB.</head><p xml:id="era3_130739">The Golden Rule Club held its regular meeting Wednesday evening, Nov. 4, at the residence of Mrs. Wendell Tucker, 5 Jay St., Cambridge. This organization was formed about thirteen years ago. At that time there were no clubs in Cambridge, and the need was felt of something of the kind to bring about unity and sociability. The Golden Rule, "Do unto others as you would they should do unto you," was taken for a motto. A monthly fee is paid, and a sick fund is maintained from which the members draw during illness. They aim to assist charity's cause whenever possible. Their efforts have been crowned with success from the beginning to the present time. The officers are: President, Mrs. N.E. Lewis; vice president, Mrs. M. James; treasurer, Mrs. H.C. Lewis; chaplain, Mrs. D. Hayes; secretary, Miss Adelaide Grandison; assistant secretary, Mrs. E.

Cole</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130766">The October meeting of the Women's Missionary Society brought together a large and interested audience. It was the first meeting since the convention, and the long-promised time had come when the delegates would tell about the stirring events of July, 1896.</p><p xml:id="era3_130768">They lived it all over again while recounting something of the women who came together to tell the reason of the faith that is in them; how through a torturous course of addresses, papers, debates and business meetings they reached the grand conclusion that even a Negro's life is worth living, and that the tendency of all things, even
<pb xml:id="era3_130767" n="5 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
the Negro's history, is toward the ideal. An important feature of the occasion was the presence of Dr. Du Bois of the Pennsylvania University, who came to tell us something of the work that he has undertaken in Philadelphia for that institution. He gave a rapid sketch of the steps that have developed the science of sociology, and he showed us what is to be gained by the colored people of this city by permitting a free investigation into their sociological condition, that the causes of certain dangerous tendencies may be discovered and, if possible, averted.</p><p xml:id="era3_130769">He has been furnished with a number of figures which say that the Negro contributes an immense disproportion of deaths from consumption, and that he crowds the police courts as does no other class in the community.</p><p xml:id="era3_130770">Now who made these figures but men of a class who are so warped by that strange American disorder, colorphobia, that before accepting their verdict we must be excused for saying we are not ready for the question.</p><p xml:id="era3_130771">On the point of deaths from consumption, I would say this: hosts of the poor are attended by young, inexperienced white physicians. They have inherited the traditions of their elders, and let a black patient cough, they immediately have visions of tubercles. Let him die, and though in the case there may be good reason for a difference of opinion, he writes "tuberculosis," and heaves a great sigh of relief that one more source of contagion is removed.</p><p xml:id="era3_130772">And who makes up the police records? To what class do most of the men in this department belong but to Irish democracy? Who can tell how many white offenders go free, either by bribery or by their own aptitude to escape the consequence of their actions?</p><p xml:id="era3_130773">You see it is the question of disproportion that I am answering. There can be no doubt that the number is large and is steadily increasing, and hence we are glad that a man whose sympathies are with us is seeking to gain information which will answer, among many other things, these two important questions: 1. Are colored people largely forced to live in unsanitary districts, and are they more ignorant and careless about the laws of health, or are they suffering the fate of all exotics?  2. Are the streams of poor and shiftless Negroes that are constantly pouring into Philadelphia responsible for the high criminal records, or do all classes contribute to fill the penal institutions?</p><p xml:id="era3_130774">While I have not implicit faith in these statistics, I recognize a state of affairs which needs the thought and help of those who belong to this accused class.</p><p xml:id="era3_130775">We must teach these people the laws of health; we must preach this new gospel, that the respectability of a household ought to be measured by the condition of the cellar; that to prolong the hours of toil or study or pleasure habitually into the night, when we must be up betimes in the morning, is to rob our offspring of vitality, and invite epilepsy, consumption, and a train of other evils.</p><p xml:id="era3_130776">We must attack the system of overcrowding in the poorer districts by urging our men to contend for laws regulating the number in one dwelling - "Cubic Air Space Laws," we can call them -- that people may not be crowded together like cattle, while soulless landlords collect fifty per cent on their investments.</p><p xml:id="era3_130777">These are the things that we can do to attack vice, disease and crime in their strongholds, for they have no complexion and they always yield to such and to no other treatment.</p><byline>REBECCA J.

Jackson</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_130779">In the latter part of July of this year of our Lord, there assembled in Washington two bodies of women, a few days intervening between the meetings. Both bodies were composed of earnest women, who were working along different lines to accomplish the same result, the betterment of the women of the race, physically, morally and intellectually. It was something new under the sun to see assembled in convention two bodies of intelligent colored women, who had no axes to grind, who were not seeking their own advancement to the utter disregard of the masses that were behind, below or beneath them. It was not only a new, but refreshing sight to see women imbued with higher thoughts, motives and aspirations, than personal aggrandizement. There was only one thing lacking to make the harmony perfect. There were two bodies with the same aims and purposes. Why two bodies and not one was the cry that went up all along the line. Why divide our strength, when the union of our forces will mean the accomplishment of so much more good for the ones we are trying to help? So earnest, so pure of motive were the leading mem-
<pb xml:id="era3_130778" n="6 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
bers of both organizations, that they were willing to yield to the demand for union, if by so doing the women of the race might be benefitted. So the union was consummated; that there was dissatisfaction, some disappointment, goes without saying. There never yet has been any organization so perfect, that every person connected with it was perfectly satisfied with everything pertaining to it. It is human nature to think and feel that we could have done it so much the better than A or B; that under the same circumstances results would have been different.</p><p xml:id="era3_130780">But we feel no loyal women to the cause will cease her efforts in this great work because everything did not go as she would have wished. That if the work is dearer to her than <hi rend="italic">self</hi>, she will buckle to with renewed energy, and next year there will be one grand Te Deum filled with triumphs of the past year. Nothing was every accomplished by sulking or complaining of what some one else has not done. The thing that should concern us most is, what am I doing? Let us profit by the example of our brothers; too much ambition, self seeking and "ways that are dark" have been the death of every organization gotten up by men for the good (?) of the race, and yet they would advice us what and how to do to make a success of our organization - Physician heal thyself. The summer is past: we are all once more back at our various occupations. Have we brought back to the work renewed strength, zeal and enthusiasm? Did our meetings last summer mean anything to us? Let us begin the practical work at once, let our efforts be redoubled. Let us begin to spread the work, start the sewing schools, the mother's meetings, the kindergartens, the efforts to raise means for charitable work, the literary clubs, everything that means work, earnest, helpful work. If we do this we will forget that there is anything that does not exactly commend itself to us as individuals. Our success or failure depends on the individual: there is no one without his influence and following. Let your influence be wholesome, broad and liberal: let charity take possession of every woman in the organization, and we can write success in bold, glowing letters for the coming year.</p><salute>Always for the cause,</salute><signed><name>FRANCES J.

Washington, "The Awakening of the Negro." It is a very graphic picture of the present condition of the race, its weakness, its progress, its ambition, and its great needs. In reading it, one is impressed not only by the broad and practical common sense of the author as the institutor of the great work now being carried on, but also by his deep insight and keen observations. One of' the best thoughts or suggestions in the article is this:</p><p xml:id="era3_130788">"Let us go on for a few more years knitting our business and industrial relations into those of the white man, till a black man gets a mortgage on a white man's house that he can foreclose at will. The white man on whose house the mortgage rests will not try to prevent that negro from voting when he goes to the polls."</p><p xml:id="era3_130789">Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. are about to publish a volume of poems by Paul Lawrence Dunbar, with in introduction by William Dean Howells. Mr. Dunbar is a full-blooded American Negro. He has a pleasing, manly and refined face, and until recently was an elevator boy in Dayton, Ohio. His best work is in the dialect of his race. A few of his verses have been appearing occasionally in the magazines, and coming to the attention of Mr. Howells, he discovered in him a poet of undisputed talent. Mr. Howells says of him: "What struck me in reading Mr. Dunbar's poetry was what had already struck his friends in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky and Illinois. They had felt as I felt, that however gifted his race had proved itself in music, in oratory, in several other arts, here was the first instance of an American Negro who had evinced innate literature . . . . So far as I could remember, Paul Dunbar was th only man of pure African blood and American civilization to feel the Negro life aesthetically and express it lyrically. It seems to me that this had come to its most modern consciousness in him, and that his brilliant and unique achievement was to have studied the American Negro objectively, and to have represented him as he found him to be with humor, with sympathy, and yet with what the reader must feel to be with entire truthfulness. I said that a race which had come to this effect in any member of it, had attained civilization in him; and I permitted myself the imaginative prophecy that the hostilities and the prejudices which had so long constrained his race were destined to vanish in the arts; that these were to be final proof that God had made of one blood all nations of men. I thought his merits positive and not comparative, and held that if his black poems had been written by a white man I should not have found them less admirable. I accepted them as evidence of the essential unity of the human race, which does not think or feel black in one and white in another, but humanity in all."</p><p xml:id="era3_130790">The following is one of Mr. Dunbar's poems:</p><div xml:id="era3_04.10.01" type="Poem"><head rend="center">WHEN DE CO'N PONE'S HOT</head><docAuthor>Paul Lawrence Dunbar</docAuthor><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">Dey is times in life when Nature</l><l rend="indent3">Seems to slip a cog an' go</l><l>Jes' a-rattlin' down creation, </l><l rend="indent3">Lak an ocean's overflow; </l><l>When de worl' jes' stahts a-spinin'</l><l rend="indent3">Lak a pickaninny's top. </l><l>An' yo' cup o' joy is brimmin'</l><l rend="indent3">Twel it seems about to slop; </l><l>An' yo' feel jes' lak a racah</l><l rend="indent3">Dat is trainin' fu' to trot, </l><l>When yo' mammy ses de blessin'</l><l rend="indent3">An' de co'n pone's hot. </l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">When yo' set down at de table, </l><l rend="indent3">Kin o' weary lak an' sad, </l><l>An' you se jes' a little tiahed</l><l rend="indent3">An' puhaps a little mad, </l><l>How yo' gloom tu 'ns into gladness, </l><l rend="indent3">How yo' joy drives out de doubt, </l><l>When de oven do is opened</l><l rend="indent3">An' de smell comes po' in' out. </l><l>Why, de 'lectric light o' Heaven</l><l rend="indent3">Seems to settle on de spot, </l><l>When yo' mammy ses de blessin'</l><l rend="indent3">And de co'n pone's hot. </l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">When de cabbage pot is streamin'</l><l rend="indent3">An' de bacon good an' fat, </l><l>When de chittlin is a sputterin'</l><l rend="indent3">So's to show you whah dey's at, </l><l>Take away yo' sody biscuit, </l><l rend="indent3">Take away yo' cake an' pie, </l><l>Fu de glory time is comin'</l><l rend="indent3">An' its proachin' very nigh: </l><l>An' yo' want to jump an' holler, </l><l rend="indent3">Do yo' know you'd bettah not, </l><l>When yo' mammy ses de blessin'</l><l rend="indent3">An' de co'n pone's hot. </l></lg><lg type="stanza"><l n="1">I have heered a lots o' sermons, </l><l rend="indent3">An' I've heered a lots o' prayers, </l><l>An' I've listened to some singin'</l><l rend="indent3">Dat has took me up the stairs</l><l>Of de Glory Lan' an' set me</l><l rend="indent3">Jes below de Marster's th'one, </l><l>An' has lef' my haht a-singin'</l><l rend="indent3">In a happy aftah-tone; </l><l>But dem wuds so sweetly murmured</l><l rend="indent3">Seems to tech de softes' spot, </l><l>When yo' mammy ses de blessin'</l><l rend="indent3">An' de co'n pone's hot.</l></lg></div></div><pb xml:id="era3_130791" n="8 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/><div xml:id="era3_04.11" type="Staff"><p xml:id="era3_130792">THE WOMAN'S ERA, PUBLISHED AT 103 CHARLES ST., BOSTON, MASS.</p><p xml:id="era3_130793">ORGAN OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLORED WOMEN.</p><p xml:id="era3_130794">OFFICERS:</p><list type="simple"><item>Pres., Mary Church Terrell, Washington, D.C.</item><item>1st Vice Pres., Josephine St. P.

If the evidence against Mr. Allen can be trusted, it would seem that his election is not creditable to his race, his party or his state. Yet distressing as is this aspect of the case, public attention will hardly fail to note another view a thousand times more deplorable. It is of far less significance that the councilor-elect may not be fit than that the political management of the state should use her highest offices for such questionable ends. It makes it no better that in this case the nomination was supposed to mean nothing. The motive is as contemptible from this point of view as it is from any other.

Miss Lilian Heywood of Boston talked in an impromptu way on intemperance as a cause; Miss L. Rochan discussed the subject from the point of negligence; Mrs. A. M. Craig, who comes to us as a voter from Kansas, and a bride of a member of the faculty, gave some very suggestive and telling remarks on poverty as a cause. Miss Estelle Penney, in a touching manner, spoke of the alarming rate of infant mortality among the colored people, and urged each member of the club to sound the alarm among the many inhumane mothers who, from causes for which they might find a cure, bring into the world so many weak, puny infants, born to die before a few months pass over their heads. Miss Pinn said that she was sure that the root of the matter lies in the dense ignorance of the masses, and the alarming rate of mortality will be lessened wherever they are in

One branch of the charity work will be mothers' meetings. In this city, where there is so much suffering among the poor during the cold months of the year, there is no calculating the good that is done by gathering in the older women from homes of desolation and strife into a warm room to receive a work of cheer and advice. Necessary garments are cut for them, and they are taught in many cases how to put them together. The cup of coffee and biscuit which furnishes the repast is thoroughly enjoyed by them, and no doubt these meetings help many to better ways of life: at any rate a little sunshine is thus thrown into their empty lives. That somebody does care for them is in itself an uplifting thought, and eases many a worn and weary soul. I believe in helping the children, but there is a wonderful amount of satisfaction in doing something for these older ones. This branch of the work falls under the Loving Service Section. The literary feature for the winter will be to study the lives of characters of our own race to whom only casual attention has been given: as for instance Sojourner Truth, Phyllis Wheatley, Crispus Attucks, Harriet Tubman and others. This is a matter which should commend itself to all, but it is of especial importance to the rising generation that they should be familiar with the valorous lives and self-sacrificing deeds of those in their own ranks, so that in an interchange of views, a Douglass may be placed beside a Washington, a Harriet Tubman beside a Joan of Arc, and so on to the end.</p><p xml:id="era3_130810"> This lack of knowledge of our own distinguished people was forcibly impressed upon me on one occasion when in a company of highly intelligent women the name of Amanda Smith was mentioned, and of them all only the one who mentioned the name had ever heard of Amanda Smith.</p><p xml:id="era3_130811">In addition to the two sections named there is a Social Purity Section and a Culture Section, the work of which will at some future time be outlined.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_04.13.03" type="Report"><head rend="center">AND STILL ANOTHER CLUB.</head><docAuthor>Mamie L.

E. C. by Mrs. F. R. Ridley, Secretary.]</p><p xml:id="era3_130819">The woman's club, that broad institution devoted to general advancement and cultivation, has made itself so much a part of the life of today that the time will soon come when we will accept it as it necessary adjunct of our civilization, and forget that there was ever a time when we were clubless. And yet the movement is almost <hi rend="italic">fin de siecle</hi>. Fifty years ago the average woman knew nothing of life save as she saw it from her own fireside, and her participation in public affairs was extremely limited. Today the average woman is studying the currency question, and has an active interest in at least one home or hospital. A movement so comprehensive, so spontaneous and so general must necessarily be grounded upon deep and vital principles and have grown out of actual needs and necessities. As much as the club movement means in the way of new opportunities and privileges for women, it has a deeper meaning and a higher significance: it is in its way a recognition and realization of the oneness of the race and of our common brotherhood. In this respect it is a worthy movement of the time and of the country, founded upon the principles of the democracy; it is in line with the great movements and one of the steps toward the time when man shall love his neighbor as himself.</p><p xml:id="era3_130820">Consider the scope of the subjects considered and work undertaken by the woman's clubs of the country: Better homes for the poor, more <choice><sic>Homes</sic><corr>homes</corr></choice> for the unfortunate, shortened hours and better sanitary surroundings for laborers, temperance reform, moral education, domestic economy, the spread of general culture. To all these questions the women are bringing enthusiasm and interest. They are questions which especially appeal to them, and which they are fitted by nature and by enlarged opportunities to consider. Thoughtful consideration along these lines cannot but have great influence upon public sentiment, and in time bring about the desired reform. How shallow, how without thought the criticism that the woman's clubs mean nothing but "talk, talk." "Why don't they do something?" Some people's measure of good is an entirely material one; they recognize little that cannot be seen or handled, and consider nothing an advantage that does not add to material prosperity. We are all too much under the control of material things, and too slow to recognize the power of thought. A woman's club may not build a home for the unfortunate, but if it opens the eyes and the hearts of its members to the condition of these unfortunates, if it considers ways in which their misfortune might be averted, if it extends its intelligence and influence over the conduct of those who have the institution under management, it is fulfilling its mission, and a noble one, too; and the woman who cannot see it is sadly in need of the enlightenment she could find in the club. The essence of club life is talk, but it is talk that is the result of thought, and it is peculiar, to say the least, that those who will talk most assiduously about nothing should make such objections to the talk, which is of something, and it is a tribute to the intelligence of women that she has come to a realization of her power and is using it along the line of her greatest talent, her ability to talk. It is almost an inspiration that has opened up club life to her and given her the opportunity to use her influence through her strongest medium, her general felicity of language.</p><p xml:id="era3_130821">It is true the club is all talk; it was created to furnish opportunities for talk, but it is talk that means something: it may be pure fun or wit, but never vapidity.</p><p xml:id="era3_130822">However, in the conduct of life, each must he largely a law unto himself. Our needs, our duties are varied, and it is possible that in some lives clubs should have no place, and yet clubs tire so broad in spirit and catholic in taste, and elective in subjects of study, that it would seem that through them every woman might be reached, and surely a woman could receive little from them that is not beneficial. There are those who will carry anything to extremes, and because some abuse their privileges and neglect other duties for club work, it does not prove that club work is not beneficial. In considering the value of woman's clubs, we have dwelt largely with the more direct and apparent advantages. It is well that we should give some thought to club life in its deepest significance.</p><p xml:id="era3_130824">We are all children of our Father, traveling, one road dependent upon one another, not only for social life and diversion, but for inspiration, education and an opportunity to call into life and activity the virtues that are dormant within us. This getting out and mingling together is bringing us to a realization of our common humanity; it brings us face to face with our own deficiencies
<pb xml:id="era3_130823" n="11 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
and the worth of others. It is one of the longest steps toward our salvation.</p><p xml:id="era3_130825">There is no factor in modern times so active in bringing about a universal brotherhood or sisterhood. It is supplementing the work of the public school and the church, for the clubs have opened the doors of the homes and found a common meeting ground based on worth and a common humanity.</p><p xml:id="era3_130826">There are still those who consider exclusiveness a virtue and are proud of a limited acquaintanceship. Women's clubs are helping to bring us to a recognition of the truth that true dignity does not need barriers in order to preserve itself; that snobbishness is a vice, and that while friendship should be bound by congeniality, neighborliness should know no bounds. The club means the spirit of neighborliness with the world, the recognition of our duty toward our neighbor, and not only of our common humanity but our common divinity; the club helps us not only to make the best of that within us, but to see the best of that in others. In this aspect it is the embodiment of a great principle; a principle which may not be always worked out in this form, but which nevertheless will never die; a principle with which we are to enter in and partake of everlasting life.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_04.13.05" type="Report"><head rend="center">NEBRASKA CLUB NOTES.</head><docAuthor>S.

The first of a series of public Sunday afternoon meetings was held on the 17th of October at the Twelfth Baptist Church. It was a novel feature in its way, and drew a large crowd of women interested in the work, and men, curious to know just what the work meant. The latter were skeptical and quite prepared to smile with superior indifference, but changed their minds before the afternoon was over.</p><p xml:id="era3_130853">After the opening prayer Mrs. Ruffin spoke, explaining the scope, ends and aims of club work among women, the work of the July convention in Washington and the winter plans for the Woman's Era Club. Mrs. Hannah Smith and Mrs. Agnes Adams, delegates to the Washington convention, presented each an able and interesting report.</p><p xml:id="era3_130854">The main feature of the afternoon, however, was a paper by Mrs. Florida Ridley on club life among women. It was a splendid effort and was deeply appreciated by the audience. Mrs. Ridley's paper did more, perhaps, towards <choice><sic>dispeling</sic><corr>dispelling</corr></choice> from the minds of the cynically disposed present, all doubts as to the efficacy of woman's clubs than any other feature of the meeting.</p><p xml:id="era3_130855">Music was furnished by a well-chosen choir under the direction of Mr. George Ruffin.

The existence and noble purposes of this institution have been mentioned more than once in the ERA, but people not living in Chicago can scarcely appreciate how much it means to the progressive spirit of the colored people of this great city.</p><p xml:id="era3_130866">Provident Hospital and Training School was conceived in the brain and heart of Dr. Daniel H. Williams, now Surgeon in Chief of Freedman's Hospital, Washington, D.C. When he suggested the idea of such an institution six years ago, he instantly had the co-operation of many of the very best people of the city. But at best, Provident Hospital was but an experiment. It began modestly in a small rented building. Soon, however, the importance and noble usefulness of this institution was recognized by all Chicago. By clean, careful and economic management, the institution grew in favor and demand beyond the most sanguine hopes of its generous founder.</p><p xml:id="era3_130868">Among the friends attracted to it are such men as P.D. Armour, Geo. M. Pullman, H.H. Kohlsaat, Geo. H. Webster and Marshall Field. It is a splendid evidence of the shrewdness and
<pb xml:id="era3_130867" n="14 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
efficiency of the management of the institution that they were able to win the interest and confidence of these men of wealth.</p><p xml:id="era3_130869">Mr. Armour became so much interested that he gave $20,000 for a new building, ad the other gentlemen gave nearly $20,000 more for furnishing and endowment. The building was completed and turned over to the people October 29th.</p><p xml:id="era3_130870">The building is four stories in height, constructed of red brick and terra cotta, in the style of the Italian Renaissance. It is pronounced by architects, engineers and physicians to be the most perfectly equipped and most beautiful institution of its kind in the country. It is no exaggeration to say that, outside of schools, no institution in the country, owned and managed by colored people, is so thoroughly up to date in all of its appointments and possibilities as Provident Hospital and Training School. The opportunity offered for the training of nurses as a profession and for young colored physicians is unexampled. Many of the best physicians and surgeons of both races are on the medical staff. Indeed, the institution is so broad in its aims, sympathies, and opportunities that it is something more, even, than a colored hospital and training school.  It has served an excellent purpose in bringing both races together, and has been one of the best modifiers of race prejudice in the city.</p><p xml:id="era3_130871">The opening celebration of the new building, on the 28th inst., was a great social event. There was such a mixing up of millionaires and poor people in terms of social equality as is seldom witnessed outside politics. The officers of the institution are Lloyd G. Wheeler, president; Dr. C.E. Bentley, secretary; and J.S. Madden, treasurer. These well known business men, together with other representative citizens of Chicago, have been connected officially with Provident Hospital ever since its creation, and to them belong the credit for its remarkable success.</p><p xml:id="era3_130872">I scarcely know how to write about social matters in Chicago. Mere personalities and society functions are not very safe things to indulge in by correspondents. It may be said, however, that Chicago is peculiarly independent in social matters. Here there is more of sociability than "society." The conventionalities and artificialities of society life generally are less important in Chicago than in most cities. This condition seems to be due to several distinct causes; among them are the churches, clubs and other organizations that have sprung up in response to new duties to civic interests. We are particularly fortunate in having an exceptionally progressive and intelligent ministry. The majority of our city ministers are college-bred men. They have all been in touch with the very best forces of the day. They are all liberal to the extent of making their church influence important and salutary in every thing in which the people generally are interested. It is not an unusual thing to see representative laymen, and even non-church going men and women, occupying the pulpits in behalf of some cause which, while not exactly religious, yet needs the moral helpfulness of church influence.</p><p xml:id="era3_130873">Then such clubs as the women's clubs, the King's Daughters, and the women's auxiliaries to the hospital are all doing much to infuse into the social life a more inclusive spirit of sympathy and fellowship among all the people. In no community will personal worth alone give a person better social recognition than here in Chicago.</p><p xml:id="era3_130874">The passion for education and culture among our young people is a matter of much gratification. In nearly all the professional schools, in medicine, law, theology, in both the great universities, in the business colleges and conservatories of music, art and oratory, may be seen young colored men and women diligently at work. To Miss Cora Jackson belongs the distinction of being the first of the colored race to receive a university degree from the Chicago University. Her work in the university has been a matter of great pride to us all, both because of its influence and of her personal worth and charm as a young woman.</p><p xml:id="era3_130875">Miss Mabel, the winsome daughter of Mr. and Mrs. L.G. Wheeler, expects to follow Miss Jackson by entering the university in December. She has had exceptionally good preparation for university work, and we bespeak for her a sure success.</p><p xml:id="era3_130876">Her many friends throughout the country will feel like extending greetings to Mrs. Theodore Lee Purnell of Washington, but formerly our own Theodora. Interest in her as a proud young mother will be no less cordial than was the interest in her as the most charming and popular young woman in the western Metropolis.</p><byline>FANNIE BARRIER WILLIAMS.</byline></div><div xml:id="era3_04.17" type="Article"><head rend="center">WHERE IS JOHN BROWN'S DAUGHTER.</head><p xml:id="era3_130878">The committee appointed by the W.E.C. to investigate and report upon the reliability of a

This failure is one to be particularly deplored, and it is in the nature of a public calamity.  For twenty-one years Mr. Lee and his wife have put money, brains and industry into their work, and this hotel had become one of the famous ones of this neighborhood.  In every respect it was first class and entertained many distinguished people.  In its way it was unique, for it is seldom that a suburban hotel, with all the accompaniments of parks, tennis grounds, stables, etc., can find a large winter patronage, but so attractive was the table and inner appointments that rooms were in demand here throughout the entire year.</p><p xml:id="era3_130985">The Woodland Park Hotel was a source of pride to the whole race, and the large number who have been entertained there cannot but feel a personal loss in this failure.</p><p xml:id="era3_130986">However, Mr. Lee has a couple of lucrative patents upon the market, and these together with his name and fame as a caterer must offer opportunities for the future.</p><p xml:id="era3_130987">In the restaurants conducted by Mr. Lee in several large fairs recently, it was decided novelty to see the help mixed, colored and white waitresses, clerks, cooks, etc.  The work that was being done by him was so valuable that we feel, to repeat, that his failure is a great public calamity.</p></div><div xml:id="era3_05.02" type="Article"><head rend="center"> FAIRS AND RUMORS OF FAIRS.</head><p xml:id="era3_130988">Three fairs have engaged the attention of the Woman's Era Club throughout the past autumn.  To the "Noah's Ark," for the benefit of the Charity Club Hospital, as a club they contributed only the president as one of the reception committee, although many members showed their individual interest by frequent visits to that gorgeous show.</p><p xml:id="era3_130989">At the fair for the New England Hospital for Women and Children, a Woman's Era Table helped in a modest way to make up that grand total of $13,000, which has gone into the treasury of the hospital as the financial result of many weeks of preparation by enthusiastic charity workers all over New England, and one delightful week of barter, sale and social intercourse in Tremont Temple, where the fair was held. The Rhode Island was the banner table, turning in to the treasurer of the fair about $1,700 net.</p><p xml:id="era3_130990">Following immediately upon the heels of the Hospital fair came the Woman's Era's special effort for St. Monica's Home, for sick and destitute colored women and children, tht was held in the lecture room of St. Augustine Church for three days only.  Nevertheless and despite adverse happenings (for the fair), in the shape of big weddings and other parties coming upon each evening the fair was running, the receipts were more than sufficient to supply the Home with all of its fuel for the year.  An Ednah D. Cheney Table was a feature of this fair.  This table was named in recognition of the large interest taken in and contributions given to it by Mrs. Cheney.  The articles from this table still unsold are to e used as a nucleus for still another effort for St. Monica's benefit.  Some time during the winter a supplementary sale will be held in the parlors of the Home, when it is expected that a good sum will be added to that already standing to the credit of the W.E. sewing circle.</p><div xml:id="era3_05.02.01" type="Letter"><head rend="center">Boston, Dec. 24, 1896.</head><docAuthor>Martha W.

C. The object of the National Association of Colored Women is the development and protection of our womanhood, our homes and our history, as an integral part of the great American nation. The department begins its work burdened with many obstacles. In the first place the expense of carrying on necessary correspondence, printing and numberless incidentals pertaining to active and conscientious work must be borne personally by the national organizer during this first year, and those who shall, for love of the work, and what in the providence of our Heavenly Father we hope it may mean to us as race, volunteer to help her. It is too early in the history of the association to expect it to be otherwise. It will take at least a year to get in regular order to begin taxations for departmental work. This must be apparent to all. Women have been taxed only for the maintenance of local clubs, and the expenses attached to the holding of annual conventions, consequently there is no money in the treasury for this work. Therefore, I beg our loyal, race-loving women to rally to this call, and assist in putting our association on as firm a basis as any among American women.</p><p xml:id="era3_130999">The honor and dignity of our cause will permit no hesitation or lack of interest without entailing upon us the sneers and contempt of those who have preceded us in movements of this kind. As .I partially organized body, we can have no hope of permanency. Without state organizations we are not representative. As we stand today, we represent about five thousand members -- the nucleus of a splendid force. We are too far apart -- we must be concentrated, as to purpose and method of procedure. The work of the Department of Organization is ten-fold. It must not only strive to add new clubs to the National Association, but must labor wherever practicable and consistent for the deepening of the interests and activities of the women already within the fold. As a means to this end, every club in the National Association will receive a copy of this open letter, which is addressed to them as a personal appeal urging upon their officers the great necessity of engaging in some form of practical work that the same may be done in an orderly and business-like way, and the details of any successful undertaking to be sent to the WOMAN'S ERA, our official organ, so that others anxious to work may be benefited in the matter of method and starting. Every locality needs a woman's club -- there can be no question about that. The vital question is, will the women do the work that they see is needed close to their very doors in every locality where our people live?</p><p xml:id="era3_1301001">Owing to the absence of regular appropriation to cover traveling expenses, the work must be carried on by correspondence, except in instances where women will call meetings and raise traveling expenses for organizer, either state or national. In no case will charges be made for personal service. As fast as women can be found who are willing to undertake state or section organization, such will be appointed. Advice and suggestions on this head will be gladly received. Where no state organizer has been appointed, the officers of any club in good standing may be of great assistance to this department. Any energetic woman desirous of aiding the work can call a number of women together for the purpose of organizing them. After the officers are chosen and the object decided upon, a correct list of members'
<pb xml:id="era3_1301000" n="3 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
names, officers' names and addresses, with object, should be mailed to national organizer, who will supply application blanks for club membership in the National Association.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301002">It is a matter of very grave concern, not to say humiliation and discouragement, that a great number of our women, favored in many ways beyond the masses, thus far seem inclined to regard indifferently the advantages accruing from thorough and harmonious organization. There can be no doubt that in organization woman has come into closer contact with woman, which unquestionably leads to the more perfect development of the useful woman, and through the intermingling of the universally united sympathies, a nobler, broader-minded woman. The latent activities of our women must be aroused, the almost universal indifference of our young people to things uplifting and ennobling must be checked, and the true missionary spirit must be developed and encouraged for the good of future generations. Organization dominated by judgment and necessity must be our watchword. We know the evils threatening the welfare of our people. Systematic organization will not only afford relief but will prevent retrogression, by the establishment of new and wholesome interests among our young people. It is the hope of your national organizer to report, at the convention of 1897, a vigorous club in every state in the Union, and in a majority of the cities and towns, and to that end I call upon my sister women throughout the country to help by a mighty exhibition of' womanly determination and race pride. Sisters! in all earnestness let me ask, will you actively take hold with heart and brain and place our association on a foundation second to none in America? We can do it if we <hi rend="italic">will</hi> to do it! Any communication addressed to me at 9 Murray street, New York City, will receive prompt attention.

They were "ruled out,"

and "tabled," "passed," etc., by strictly parliamentary usages that gave credence to the proceedings as being "a Parliamentary Drill," as had been planned by the executive committee. Much benefit and pleasure were derived from the exercise.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301012">The questions for discussion the present quarter are: "Is Woman Suffrage Desirable?" "The Separate Car Law," "Social Life Among Afro-Americans," "Paul Dunbar and Poems," "Training for Domestic Service," and "Frederick Douglas."</p><p xml:id="era3_1301013">The first program for this quarter was given on December 4th.

The charity section has given quite a substantial donation to the Colored Orphan Horne from the proceeds of their entertainments to that end. The study of child nature calls for ready interest and co-operation from the hearts of scores of mothers. From our literary work we are hoping to gain much intellectual development. The social section is ever alert to the pleasure of our home friends and the entertainment of all strangers who are lending a hand in the elevation of our womanhood all over this broad land. This section deserves special mention for the efforts they put forth in the reception tendered Mrs. Lucy Thurman, our beloved and honored guest. Mrs. Thurman addressed the club on this occasion, and in her speech made some very graceful remarks on Frances E. W.

The work is issued by Dodd, Mead &amp; Co., of New York, and contains an introduction by W. D. Howells. It is to be regretted that notice was not made in our race journals of its expected appearance, for a host of colored people who love their race and who believe in encouraging aspiring manhood would have been most glad to include this book
in their holiday purchase.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301069">We do not forget that we owe much to one another. If a colored man writes a good book he should find a large reading constituency among his own people. We should make our patronage so certain and remunerative, that publishers will be glad to put our books upon the market.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301070">In that way we can open a way for our aspiring young men and women, which to them thus far has been practically closed. The volume under consideration contains the latest and best of Mr. Dunbar's poems. With only a few years spent in tempting the muse, he spreads before us a feast of poetry and song, inspiring, comforting and satisfying. He has a range which wins commendation from the most severe critic, and gives to the searcher after genus a bounty to draw upon. While his dialect poems constitute a distinctive feature of his work, they by no means overshadow in point of merit the other contributions to his book. His English is chaste, his sentiment exalted, and his verse finished in point of literary excellence. "Lyrics of the Lowly " is destined to hold a high place among the best poetical contributions of the year.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301071">Speaking of the new book, the <hi rend="italic">Inter-Ocean's</hi> literary critic says" "Scarcely has a book of poems come to our table during the year more profoundly entertaining than is "Lyrics of Lowly Life."</p><p xml:id="era3_1301072">Mr. W. D. Howells writes the introduction to the volume, and says he makes no prophecy for the future, "but if Mr. Dunbar should do nothing more than he has done, I should feel that he had made the strongest claim for the Negro in English literature that the Negro has yet made." Mr. Howells adds: "Had these poems been written by a white man I should not have found them less admirable. I accepted them as an evidence of the essential unity of' the human race, which does not think or feel black in one and white in another, but humanly in all." The poems are elegant in construction, and ringing and musical in every line. The dialect poems are more remarkable and flow so easily and naturally from his pen as to be masterpieces of their kind.</p><byline>-- <hi rend="italic">Chicago Conservator.</hi></byline></div><div xml:id="era3_05.08" type="Social_Notes"><head rend="center">QUEEN LlLIOUKULANI NOW LIVES IN BROOKLINE, MASS.</head><docAuthor>Chicago Conservator</docAuthor><p xml:id="era3_1301073">Brookline is honored by the presence of royalty in the person of the ex-queen of the Sandwich Islands.

Allen continues to vindicate the judgment of those who regret that he was ever put forward as a representative of his race for a high station.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301080"><hi rend="italic">-- Boston Sunday Herald.</hi></p><p xml:id="era3_1301081">It is a well known fact that if Isaac B. Allen was put forward "as a representative of his race," it was never intended that he should represent them in the governor's council; he was set up as a man of straw to encompass certain ends and then be knocked down. His election is due to a miscarriage of a game of bluff - an old game played against the colored people so often successfully  that the political wire pullers had become reckless and this time got caught in a web of their own weaving. It is the legitimate outcome of a pernicious practice of using unfit candidates simply for effect, before election, with only the shortlived notoriety gained of having been a <hi rend="italic">candidate</hi> for their reward, after election. The result justifies an "I told you so," to the "Napoleon of politics in Massachusetts."</p><p xml:id="era3_1301082">Nevertheless and in spite of the alleged moral shortcomings of Mr. Allen and the altogether discreditable exhibitions he has made of himself since his election to a "high station," he is undoubtedly elected, and therefore entitled to the honors and emoluments of the office to which he was chosen; and as the recount and the appeal to the supreme court have failed to prevent his receiving his credentials, it would seem that the latest move of the other contestant and present occupant of the place -- that of carrying his case to the incoming legislature -- will not avail to keep Mr. Allen from taking his place among Governor Wolcott's councilors, not as a "representative of his race," however, but as an unexpectedly successful tool of political tricksters of both parties. That the situation is in embarrassing one all round cannot be denied. There is but one right way out of it, and we predict that Massachusetts will not stultify herself by refusing to adopt that way. She cannot afford to set a dangerous precedent that will some day redound to her confusion, and at once bring down upon her the sneering comments of a waiting, watchful south, to whose methods ill matters political the throwing out of Allen would give encouragement, and countenance by the greatest endorsement possible -- that of imitation.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301083">Let it be emphasized that this is no "race issue," and demagogues black and white, north and south, should be thwarted in their attempts to make one of it.

Professor Lowe introduced me to Hiram Brown - I think his name was Hiram -- a younger brother of the famous John Brown, who (Hiram) was an <choice><sic>employe</sic><corr>employee</corr></choice> of the professor. I had quite a conversation with Hiram, both Professor L. and myself having been Garrisonian abolitionists, sympathizers with John Brown, fully as cordial as with Lafayette in his heroic efforts in our country's behalf during our revolution, notwithstanding my peace principles.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301103">If I remember correctly, I learned that John Brown's widow, or other members of his family, were living in California, near Pasadena.

The old colonial mansion house was bright with flowers and full of guests during the reception hours from 3 to 5. The receiving party formed a pretty picture, as, grouped in the bay window, they greeted with charming cordiality the many friends who expressed so much pleasure at the opportunity offered to meet a charming woman, who was most womanly and cordial in her greetings in this lovely home.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301105">In the receiving party were ex-Queen Lilioukulani, with Mrs. Lee on her right, Mrs. Kia Nahsolelin  on the left, with Mr. Lee, Miss Lee, J. Haleluke and Capt. Julius Palmer in the line. The ushers were Misses Flora and Donalena MacDonald and F.M. Goss. Most delightful music was rendered during the afternoon by Miss Sarah MacDonald, harpist. </p><p xml:id="era3_1301106">The ex-queen wore a gown of black velvet, with thread lace garniture, caught with rare jewels, and prominent was the badge of the Mystic Shrine, of which she was made a member in 1887. Mrs. Lee was radiantly beautiful in a costume of French gray and lace, with a circle of gold on her arm, which the guest presented as a token of friendship, a golden band with the letter "L" in plain gold, a dainty trifle which Lilioukulani wore during the days of her recent imprisonment, and Mr. Lee also wore a New Year's gift from the same source, a heart-shaped pin of pearl, with centre of amethyst.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301107">The tea room was very dainty where Mrs. Walter M. Farwell poured tea. Mrs. F. M. Goss of Melrose presided at the chocolate table, while Miss Annie Morse served frappe.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301109">Another and larger New Year's reception was that of Catabrigia Club, held in Odd Fellows Hall, North Cambridge, when six hundred gayly dressed women and a few men turned out to listen to a charming lecture on Michael Angelo, by Prof. Wm. G. Ward, of Harvard College, and incidentally to shake hands with Mrs. May Alden Ward, vice-president of the club, Professor Ward, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Estelle M. Merritt, and the handsome and genial ex-Mayor Bancroft, of Cambridge, all of whom made up the receiving party, and then to partake of dainties served by the lovely girls of the club.

Walker, a graduate of the New York Art School, who went to Paris, France, to further perfect herself in the art of painting, has returned to her home in Washington, after a most successful course in one of the highest art schools in Europe. After Mrs. Walker had studied in Paris only four months she painted a picture from life, which was accepted by the French Salon, where it was put on exhibition, and it must be remembered that an art student is considered fortunate to get a pastel into the Salon, after having studied for years.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301112">Messrs.

Miss Dandridge, among other places, visited Hampton and Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C., and is loud in her praise of the systematic way in which work is carried on in both institutions.

The sun beat down upon the brown earth and baked it hard in wagon furrows that could cut small toes and cause <choice><sic>woful</sic><corr>woeful</corr></choice> stumbles. But Tom didn't care for that; he blinked up at the yellow orb in the cloudless skies and hummed a ditty carelessly, the while he swung his small body to and fro on the fence.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301121">Tom was a small, black boy, one of the brood which was like that of the unfortunate old shoe woman of undisputed fame. His small life of ten years had been passed about Harvey's Canal in Jefferson's parish, just across from and within sight of the big city. The small, fussy, inconsequential ferryboat laboriously puffed and tooted its way from Louisiana avenue over to the landing every hour, and occasionally landed someone besides the blackberry merchants who lived in and about Amesville. The canal lay peacefully green and placid, reflecting huge oaks and lazy boats on its surface, and rippling with a knowing wink over the occasional flip of a fish's fin. There
<pb xml:id="era3_1301120" n="12 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
were never such fish in the world as those that glided lazily through the green waters of Harvey's Canal.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301122">"Hey diddle de diddle, de fiddle am broke<lb/>
Oh, what am I gwine to do?"</p><p xml:id="era3_1301123">crooned Tom, blinking in the hot December sun and wondering when he was going to ride on the
crab-like ferry to see the wonderful Christmas windows in New Orleans. Then he slid from his perch on the rail fence and danced away, his heterogeneous garments flapping in the soft, damp breeze.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301124">Tom's cabin, or rather the cabin this latest old shoe woman, marked the southern boundary of the great sugar plantation which had formed the town of Amesville. Beyond, the blue smoke of the sugar house curled into the bluer skies, and the odor of the kettles reached in succulent deliciousness far and wide. Like waving billows of promised sweetness the fields of cane extended far, green topped, red stalked, rustling vaguely as they whispered together of molasses and <hi rend="italic">la cuit</hi>. The dusty road that wound in dazzling, furrowed whiteness along the levee, was bordered by rustling weeds, with wonderful feathery heads, and an occasional giant oak with tender acorns. Tom's bare feet carried him swiftly by the snake fence toward the overseer's house. An idea had struck him.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301125">A half hour later Aunt Mina, looking from the window of her cabin, saw a sight that made her heart stand still. On the narrow plank bridge which spanned the canal at the foot of the levee sat Tom and Nellie, the flaxen-haired little daughter of the overseer. Black feet and white ones, bare alike swing gaily over the placid waters, and black hands and white ones alike gaily trolled long strings of baited cord, with pin-hook attachments; tousled gold and crinkly black heads alike eagerly peering into the water after the recreant fish.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301126">Tom and Nellie had been chums from the time that the big turkey had chased the little  girl down the field and Tom had valiantly stood before him, alone, unaided, and heroically driven him into the sugar house yard, there to meditate grimly on an ignominious defeat. From that day, Nellie had been Tom's especial charge and confidential advisor, and though her years were fewer, she was none the less a most matronly and self-possessed little person. There was no secret about it; your plantation <hi rend="italic">child</hi> knows no white or black, even in these days.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301127">The pin-hooks trailed in the waters; the crab ferry tooted its arrival;  and the big French steamer anchored just outside the levee in the yellow waters of the Mississippi heaved lazily, while the sailors bristled about getting the ship trim for the Christmas day's festivities.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301128">Aunt Mina stood holding her breath; one turn of the foot, one gesture too violent, and the unconscious children might fall into the canal, placid, green, beautiful, but fatally deep. Singing down the road, now lightened by the first pink premonitions of sunset came Nellie's father and two hunters, cheerful under empty game bags. Around the bend which curved about Aunt Mina's cabin they trudged, then paused in horror.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301129">With one bare white foot upon the rude bridge and the other swinging free, Nellie was pulling with all her small might at the pin-hooked line and</p><p xml:id="era3_1301130">"Nellie !" cried the overseer. His voice beat against the skies and rang around into every bush and tree in anguish indescribable.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301131">The child turned her head in fright, the string loosened suddenly, and she fell, a white curled-up heap into the water.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301132">There was an awful moment of shrieks and curses, of running and boat getting, of moans, low, and of sobs, and wails. Then Tom was seen with the sobbing white form in his arms, manfully swimming to the post of the bridge. The overseer caught them both in his arms and rushed into the shoe woman's cabin, his face white, haggard.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301133">It was Nellie who spoke first; "You see," she volunteered between sobs and shivers,  "me'n Tom wuz goin' to ketch fish and sell 'em, so's we could buy things in town. Tom wuz goin' to buy Aunt Mina an' me a present, an' I wuz goin' to buy papa and Tom somethin', an' - an' I fell in."</p><p xml:id="era3_1301135">But Tom's little form lay gray and still save where a patch of red clotted in his curly hair showed the cut of the bridge post as he jumped in the water. Outside, the crab-like ferry tooted goodbye to the hazy ocean steamer, while the setting sun crimsoned alike with caressing fingers the yellow water of the river and the green canal. A mocking bird  called one long note of wailing sweetness from the reeds by the bridge. The gathering shadows in the cabin shrouded the curious forms of the shoe woman's family, and
<pb xml:id="era3_1301134" n="13 THE WOMAN'S ERA."/>
veiled the uncovered heads of the overseer and the hunters.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301136">"Poor Tom," sobbed Nellie.</p><p xml:id="era3_1301137">And who knows but what it was best?</p></div><div xml:id="era3_05.16" type="Filler"><head rend="center"><seg type="short-title">THE WOMAN'S ERA AND AMERICAN KITCHEN MAGAZINE</seg> ONE YEAR FOR ONE DOLLAR.
